RECOGNIZING CARBON 
SHREDDERS 

(Mr. WELCH of Vermont asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 

Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity 
to recognize the dedicated efforts 
of Carbon Shredders, a grassroots 

environmental group based in the Mad 
River Valley of Vermont. Formed in 
the fall of 2007 by three local environmentalists, 
Carbon Shredders dedicates 
its time to curbing local energy consumption, 
helping Vermonters lower 
their energy costs, and working towards 
a clean energy future. The group 
challenges participants to alter their 
lifestyles in ways consistent with the 
goal of reducing energy consumption. 

In March, three Vermont towns 
passed resolutions introduced by Carbon 
Shredders that call on residents 
and businesses to reduce their carbon 
footprint by 10 percent by 2010. In addition 
to the obvious environmental advantages, 
participating households will 
save $700 each year. Carbon Shredders’ 
membership has grown considerably in 
Vermont since its founding, and this 
group is doing tremendous work in 
Vermont to lead us to a carbon-free 
economy.

LET’S STAY AND GET THE JOB 
DONE 

(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, today the House of 
Representatives will adjourn for 5 
weeks. It is troubling that the Democratic 
leadership sees no problem in 
taking a 5-week vacation, having failed 
to vote on legislation that will lower 
gas prices and break our dependence on 
foreign oil. 

House Republicans have laid out a 
plan of exploration, alternative energy 
innovation, and conservation, a comprehensive 
strategy that pulls together 
this Nation’s immense natural resources 
and our rapidly advancing 
technology to reduce our dependence 
on foreign oil and build a more prosperous 
country. 

Let’s have a vote on a comprehensive 
energy package. Let’s show American 

families that their interests are important 
enough for this Congress to stay 
here and lower gas prices. 

In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th. Godspeed for the future careers to 
Second District staff members, Chirag 
Shah and Kori Lorick.

COMMEMORATING THE MINNEAPOLIS 
I–35W BRIDGE COLLAPSE 


(Mr. ELLISON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, last 
year on August 1, 2007, at 6:05 p.m., the 
Interstate 35W bridge in Minneapolis 
collapsed into the Mississippi River. 
Thirteen people lost their lives, injuring 
nearly 100 people. The 13 victims 
were mothers, fathers and children. 

Last year on August 1, this day, we 
as a Nation were united in our grief for 
the victims. Today, the new I–35W 
bridge stands almost complete over the 
Mississippi River. I have had a chance 
to tour it, and it is a good-looking 
bridge. But we can never forget about 
the victims and the lessons that we 
have learned from the collapse. 

We will be having a memorial today 
in Minneapolis for the victims, and we 
will be celebrating the fact that we 
have come back and been a resilient 
community after this collapse. 

But I believe the tragic bridge collapse 
serves as a national call to action 
for our political leaders to focus on improving 
our domestic infrastructure. 
The time is now, Madam Speaker.

H7792 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE August 1, 2008 

Mr. WESTMORELAND. This morning 
I’m here, and if I could talk to the people 
of America, Madam Speaker, I 
would tell them that the number to the 
House operator is 202–224–3121, but I 
know I can’t do that. But if I could, it 
would be 202–224–3121, and I would ask 
for Speaker PELOSI. 

I would tell Speaker PELOSI that I’m 
not a hoax because, see, here’s a quote: 
‘‘This call for drilling in areas that are 
protected is a hoax, it’s an absolute 
hoax on the part of the Republicans 
and the administration.’’ 

The American people, Madam Speaker, 
73 percent of them are not a hoax. 
She’s too busy trying to save the planet. 
Speaker PELOSI announced, ‘‘I’m 
trying to save the planet.’’ 

I hope, Madam Speaker, that if the 
American people could get this number 
that they could call the Speaker and 
say, ‘‘Before you save the planet, let’s 
secure America.’’ 

Madam Speaker, we’re going to adjourn 
today, and many in this House 
are going to leave for a vacation, a trip 
overseas, to Africa, Europe, Asia, while 
my constituents can’t even afford to 
drive to a State park. 

We must stay in session. We must do 
something to increase U.S. oil production. 


f 

HEATING OIL 
(Mr. HALL of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HALL of New York. Madam 
Speaker, sky-high prices for gas and 
heating oil have taken a big bite out of 
family budgets. Just as we enter the 
home stretch of the summer driving 
season, these same families are bracing 
for increased prices in home heating 
oil. 
Families in my district use heating 
oil to stave off winter cold, and too 
many of them are already shivering. 
We’re not even into the heating season 
yet, and already prices in the Hudson 
Valley are over $4.60, 70 percent more 
than last year. 
We need to throw these families a 
lifeline and fix the energy crisis threatening 
them. 
To help with the costs, I have cosponsored 
the HEATR Act to give qualifying 
families a $500 tax credit for their 
heating costs over $1,500. 
To fix the markets, the majority has 
tried repeatedly to provide support for 
new technologies, increased domestic 
drilling, and oil releases from the SPR. 
Each time, the President and his allies 
have opposed these measures and are 
holding our energy solutions hostage 
to their insistence on old, ineffective 
drilling proposals. 
They need to get out of D.C. and see 
how these prices are affecting working 
families, figure out how to join us, or 
soon we will all be out in the cold. 

f 

LET’S PASS MEANINGFUL 
LEGISLATION 
(Mr. GINGREY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 

minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, a famous 
American, Will Rogers once said, 
‘‘The only thing I know about American 
politics is what I read in the newspaper.’’ 


Madam Speaker, what I read in the 
newspaper this morning are these headlines: 
‘‘A shadow over recess. Impasse 
on energy obscures victories as Dems 
head home.’’ 

Another headline: ‘‘Energy shadow 
falls over the August recess.’’ 

Reading further, I thought we had a 
little ray of light and encouragement 
in a press conference that the Speaker 
gave yesterday. ‘‘And, asked if she 
could envision a scenario where there 
could be a vote on new offshore drilling, 
she said, ‘Of course.’ 

‘‘But shortly thereafter, Pelosi’s office 
issued a written ‘clarification’ 
stating that Pelosi was not changing 
her position.’’ 

And the quote now, ‘‘She has no 
plans to bring to the floor a bill to 
allow drilling in protected areas.’’’ 

Unconscionable, Madam Speaker. I 
don’t know what the plan is. Maybe it’s 
in one of the chapters of a new book 
that she’s spent the last 3 months writing 
while she should have been doing 
something, Madam Speaker, about 
these high gasoline prices that are 
crippling this Nation. Unconscionable. 

Let’s stay here. Let’s not adjourn. 
Let’s pass meaningful legislation.

ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF I–35 
BRIDGE TRAGEDY 

(Mr. WALZ of Minnesota asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 

Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Madam 
Speaker, it was one year ago today, at 

6:05 p.m. this evening, that an eight-
lane steel truss span bridge collapsed 
into the Mississippi River in Minneapolis. 
I’m sure we all remember 
that strange and surreal sight of a 
bridge laying in the very river it used 
to span and the images of vehicles that 
were crushed in the debris. 
As a school teacher, for me the most 
poignant and terrifying image was that 
of a school bus balanced over the abyss 
as it was about to plunge into the steel 
and concrete below, but whose occupants 
were thankfully all unharmed. 

Unfortunately, not everyone on that 
bridge made it home safely; 13 people 
were killed in the tragedy. That those 
numbers weren’t higher was due in no 
small part to the hundreds of firefighters, 
police, emergency personnel 
and ordinary citizens who rushed to 
the aid of their fellow Americans. 
Their direct actions immediately following 
this tragedy saved lives and 
eased suffering. 

Ordinary residents of Minneapolis 
displayed extraordinary courage on August 
1. We are here today to note this 

sad occasion and to remember those 
who were lost. 

Construction on a new bridge is underway. 
It will be wider, longer, more 
reliable and safer. And I thank my colleague 
who spoke earlier, Mr. ELLISON, 
for his leadership on that, but it won’t 
bring back those who tragically died. 

Let us learn from this disaster and 
ensure it never happens again. 

f 

AMERICANS DEMAND ENERGY 
PLAN 

(Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee 
asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 

Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, we need an American 
energy plan and we need it now. The 
American people are hurting. Young 
families are hurting. Senior adults are 
hurting. Small businesses are hurting. 
Vern, from Jefferson County, Tennessee, 
is hurting. 

Vern is an Iraqi war veteran. Vern 
has to drive from Jefferson County in 
Tennessee all the way into Knoxville. 
It’s costing him over $90 a week to 
drive to work. He makes $8 an hour. 
He’s trying to become an electrical apprentice. 


Vern told me he may have to go on 
welfare. Vern has a young family. Vern 
is an Iraqi war yet. Vern wants to do 
what’s right by his family. He has already 
done what’s right by America. 
This Congress needs to do what’s right 
for Vern and other young families in 
America, senior adults in America, 
small businesses in America. 

We don’t need any more excuses. We 
need to vote on meaningful energy legislation. 
We need to do it now. We 
don’t need to go home, we need to take 
votes. I’m willing to stay here today 
and vote. We voted this week. We had 
time to vote to go home. We ought to 
have time to vote to bring down gas 
prices at the pump. The American people 
demand it, they demand it now. 

f 

HOUSE REPUBLICANS STAND BY 

THE PRESIDENT’S DRILL AND 

VETO POLICIES OF THE PAST 

(Mr. PALLONE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 

Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, 
House Republicans claim to be interested 
in supporting legislation that 
will help reduce the price of gas at the 
pump, but unfortunately they have 
consistently opposed legislation that 
would directly benefit the American 
people. 

Republicans said no to cracking down 
on price gouging. They said no to repealing 
billions in taxpayer-funded 
subsidies to Big Oil so that we can instead 
invest in renewable energy resources. 
They said no to legislation 
that would force big oil companies to 
either drill on the lands they already 
have leased or lose the leases. 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7793 

Last week, the Republicans said no 
to tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
to help lower gas prices immediately. 
And this week they said no to 
going after speculation. 

Madam Speaker, if House Republicans 
are serious about helping the 
American people, they need to stop 
protecting Big Oil. 

f 

PRICE AT THE PUMP IS NOT A 
HOAX 

(Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 

Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to express my sincere disappointment 
with the liberal Democrat leadership 
of this House. 

I think it’s important that they realize 
the price at the pump is not a hoax, 
it’s not a mirage, it is not a bad dream, 
it is real life. And to my constituents 
in the Seventh District of Tennessee, 
they are angry with the price at the 
pump. 

What we are hearing from them is 
this, Madam Speaker: we can’t afford 
the change the Democrat Congress has 
wrought. We can’t afford the price that 
they have delivered at the pump. And 
we definitely cannot afford for the 
Democrat Congress to vote themselves 
an adjournment resolution and leave 
for 5 weeks—5 weeks, while the price at 
the pump continues to rise, while the 
price of electric power rises, while 
home heating oil prices are going to 
triple. 

This is reality. It is real life. And it 
is what is facing our constituents every 
single day. Take some of the power 
you’re using to save the planet and use 
it to address this issue.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIRMAN 

The Acting CHAIRMAN (during the 
vote). Two minutes remain in this 
vote. 

b 1012 

So the amendment was rejected. 

The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 

Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in 
support of H.R. 6599, Military Construction 
and Veterans Affairs Act, 2009. This legislation 
builds upon last year’s needed increases 
in military construction and veterans affairs 
funding, and continues to make our veterans 
a top priority. 

As a veteran, I am pleased that H.R. 6599 
provides more support for our veterans. H.R. 
6599 includes a total of $47.7 billion for the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. $40.8 billion 
supports the Veterans Health Administration, 
VHA, and Veterans Medical Services, which 
expects to serve over 5.8 million patients next 
year. To improve access to care for our veterans, 
H.R. 6599 provides $200 million for 
fee-based providers where VHA services are 
not available. The bill also raises the travel reimbursement 
rate from 28.5 cents per mile to 

41.5 cents per mile to help thousands of rural 
veterans get care. A continuing backlog at the 
VA forces our veterans to wait far too long to 
receive the benefits that they have earned. 
This bill will enable the VA to hire 1,400 new 
casework processors. Our veterans are men 
and women who have answered the call of 
duty to serve our country, and we have a duty 
to provide them with the best possible care 
when they return. 
This bill addresses the specific issues that 
we see affecting our soldiers returning today 
from Iraq and Afghanistan. H.R. 6599 provides 
a $250 million increase to support prosthetics 
and new prosthetic technology, as well as 
$3.8 billion for specialty mental health services 
and $584 million for substance abuse programs. 
This is funding that can help address 

the growing incidence of post traumatic stress 
disorder and traumatic brain injury cases 
among our returning soldiers. 

As the Representative of Fort Bragg, one of 
the largest United States Army bases in the 
country, I am pleased that this bill addresses 
the needs of our military installations. This bill 
includes $24 billion for military construction, including 
an increase of $300 million for replacing 
inadequate military housing. Fort Bragg is 
expanding rapidly, and there are crucial funds 
in this bill to meet new demands. H.R. 6559 
includes over $21 million for road construction 
and $78 million for on-base school constructions, 
to meet the needs of the influx of people 
at Fort Bragg. In addition, this bill includes 
$1,300,000 that I requested to construct a new 
mass casualty facility at Womack Army Medical 
Center for triage and decontamination purposes 
for the surrounding area. H.R. 6599 
provides $5.6 billion for new military construction 
and family housing, in line with the ‘‘Growing 
the Force’’ initiative to increase the size of 
the Army, Marine Corps and National Guard 
and Reserve. Finally, I am pleased that there 
is an increase of $1.8 billion for the Base Realignment 
and Closure Act, BRAC, to continue 
these efforts. 

I support H.R. 6599, Military Construction 
and Veterans Affairs Act, 2009, and I urge my 
colleagues to join me in voting for its passage. 

Mr. RADANOVICH. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
today to express my support for H.R. 6599, 
The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs 
FY09 Appropriations Act. Unfortunately, I was 
unable to vote on this bill today, however if I 
had been able to cast my vote I would have 
supported this measure. I have been a strong 
and consistent supporter of the military, veterans, 
and military families and this measure 
provides much needed funds to assist our 
brave men and women in uniform. 

Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support 
of this bill and our Nation’s veterans. 
Their service and sacrifice for our country is 
honorable and today this body will properly 
honor them by ensuring greater resources for 
their care and wellbeing. Congress has responded 
appropriately by increasing funding 
by $2.9 billion above the President’s request. 

This bill responds to the needs of our returning 
troops from Iraq and Afghanistan by including 
$3.8 billion for mental health resources 
to provide treatment for post traumatic stress 
syndrome and traumatic brain injuries. It includes 
$300 million above the President’s request 
for maintaining VA medical facilities. Access 
to these facilities and ensuring their proper 
upkeep has a positive impact on our communities 
and is imperative to serving the 
needs of our veterans. This bill increases enrollment 
in VA medical care for all veterans, 
including those on a limited income, by 10 
percent. To help veterans in rural areas that 
must travel to get needed health care, the 
mileage reimbursement has been increased 
from 28.5 cents to 41.5 cents. 

I therefore support this bill. These improvements 
to our VA system will have a beneficial 
impact on our veterans and move our Nation 
in the direction of providing them with the care 
they need and deserve. 

However, this bill includes funding for military 
construction projects for military operations 
in Afghanistan. The Bagram Air Base is 
the main base for the Combined Forces Air 
Component Command, CFACC. Funds from 
this bill will be used to fortify temporary build


ings, expand refueling capability and build an 
aircraft maintenance hangar at Bagram. As 
the U.S. expands and improves military facilities 
in Afghanistan, the likelihood that our 
troops will remain in the region increases. 

Including these funds, which keep our 
troops in harms way, in a bill meant to support 
our veterans is an affront to our Nation’s veterans 
and to the level of transparency our 
government should maintain. 

Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of 
this bill. 

I’m pleased that for the second year in a 
row, the 110th Congress is providing the funding 
necessary to meet the housing requirements 
of our servicemembers and their families, 
as well as the money needed to care for 
our veterans. 

Let me begin by thanking Chairman EDWARDS 
for including report language directing 
the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs 
to develop a plan to care for the veterans 
and military retirees in my district who would 
need health care services if Fort Monmouth’s 
Patterson Army Health Clinic were to close in 
2011. While I continue to oppose the decision 
to close Fort Monmouth and will continue to 
look for ways to reverse it, that decision is, for 
now, the law of the land. Accordingly, it is necessary 
to plan for meeting the medical needs 
of the many veterans and TRICARE beneficiaries 
in Central New Jersey in the event 
Fort Monmouth’s medical facilities are closed. 
I’m pleased that the Committee is requiring 
that a report on how their needs will be met 
be delivered to Congress no later than January 
30, 2009. 

Overall, this bill would provide $40.7 billion 
for VA health programs, which is $3.1 billion 
over the current level. In addition to continuing 
to focus on providing adequate funding to treat 
veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress 
disorder, PTSD, and traumatic brain injury, 
TBI, this bill would provide $400 million that 
was not requested by the President to start 
enrolling 10 percent of Priority 8 veterans in 
the VA medical system. The Priority 8 category 
is reserved for veterans whose injuries 
currently are not rated as service related and 
whose incomes are more than $24,644 if single 
or $29,576 for a veteran with a dependent. 
An estimated one half of all uninsured veterans 
are Priority 8, and Priority 8 veterans 
have not been enrolled since 2003 as part of 
an Administration effort to cut costs. 

The bill also includes $200 million, which 
was not requested by the President, to improve 
access to care where Veterans Health 
Administration, VHA, services are not available. 
I am hopeful that this will assist both 
rural veterans seeking care and those living in 
urban or ex-urban communities that currently 
lack ready access to a VA community-based 
outpatient clinic. 

The bill would provide $1.6 billion, $250 million 
more than last year, to provide veterans 
with more technologically advanced prostheses. 
The VA has a long and generally commendable 
track record in this area. However, 
I am pleased the committee recognizes the 
need for the VA to apply a greater emphasis 
on harnessing the latest technological breakthroughs 
to help give our wounded veterans 
the maximum possible personal mobility. 

I am also grateful to the committee for providing 
$165 million for grants to States for the 
construction and renovation of extended care 
facilities. The President’s proposed $80 million 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7799 

cut to this account was, frankly, unconscionable. 
The VA grant program that serves the 
State-run extended care facilities is critical. 
Many New Jersey veterans have visited with 
me over the past several years and described 
in detail the kinds of air conditioning, heating, 
and other upgrades that are vital to facilities 
such as the one in Paramus, New Jersey. I 
consistently have supported proper funding for 
this account, and I thank the committee for 
meeting this important need. 

Finally, for our active duty community, this 
bill would provide $336 million that President 
Bush failed to request to continue a quality of 
life initiative for troops and their families started 
in the Fiscal Year 2008 Supplemental Appropriations 
Act, H.R. 2642. The bill includes 
nearly $200 million for the Army and Marine 
Corps to improve the barracks that soldiers 
and Marines live in when they train. It also includes 
$136 million for medical military construction 
and planning activities to upgrade 
substandard medical treatment facilities. We 
have all seen the pictures and heard the stories 
about substandard living conditions for 
troops. I am pleased that the committee remains 
focused on fixing this problem as quickly 
as possible. 

Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill that will 
help our active duty families and our veterans. 
I will vote for it and I urge my colleagues to 
do likewise. 

Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Chairman, per the bill’s 
rule for H.R. 6599 that required preprinting of 
amendments, I submitted an amendment for 
consideration. This amendment was drafted 
incorrectly and therefore I am withdrawing the 
amendment. 

Mr. PAUL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant 
opposition to this appropriations legislation. It 
is unfortunate that my colleagues have decided 
to combine the necessary appropriations 
contained in the Veterans Affairs portion of 
this bill with the bloated and unconstitutional 
military construction appropriations. In the past 
I have voted in favor of Veterans Affairs appropriation 
bills when they were not combined 
with unwise and wasteful spending of other 
appropriations like military construction. 

This appropriation will allocate $9.5 billion to 
close bases in the United States while spending 
nearly $12 billion building other facilities 
overseas. As a matter of fact, any construction 
of new bases in the United States is prohibited 
by this bill. While I am not necessarily in favor 
of building new bases in the United States, we 
certainly should not be spending money to 
close existing domestic bases in favor of constructing 
new bases overseas. 

The bill will transfer more than $200 million 
to NATO, an organization with no purpose that 
should be disbanded immediately, for the construction 
of NATO facilities in countries where 
we have no business having our military in the 
first place. 

We have been told that we will have no permanent 
bases in Iraq, but then again we have 
no ‘‘permanent’’ bases in Korea either even 
though we have had a military presence there 
for more than 50 years. It is unclear how 
much of this $12 billion will go to building new 
facilities to maintain an indefinite presence in 
Iraq, but any such expenditure will be counterproductive 
to U.S. national interests. 

This appropriation increases construction 
funds to the service branches by as much as 
50 percent over current levels, which is financially 
dangerous and unsustainable particularly 
in view of next year’s record budget deficit. 

Mr. Chairman, it is a tragedy that necessary 
spending to keep promises to American veterans 
should be held hostage to this out of 
control spending on maintaining an unnecessary 
and dangerous U.S. empire overseas. 
We are doing no favors to today’s veterans or 
to future veterans—or to the U.S. taxpayers— 
with this appropriations bill. 

Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. 
Mr. Chairman, the 2009 Military Construction 
and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill allocates 
$47.7 billion to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs. 

This is $4.6 billion above 2008 and $2.9 billion 
over the President’s request, for veterans’ 
medical care, claims processors, and facility 
improvements. 

This bill makes available resources to support 
military construction projects and ensures 
America’s servicemen and women have more 
effective training facilities, and better housing, 
health care and day care facilities. 

I would like to take this opportunity to once 
again commend my colleagues, Congressman 
EDWARDS and Chairman OBEY for providing a 
comprehensive Military Construction and Veterans 
Appropriations for FY 2009 possible. 

This Congress has made veterans our No. 
1 priority. We understand the needs of our returning 
heroes and we will ensure that they receive 
the quality of care they deserve. 

Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, traumatic 
brain injury is one of the signature wounds of 
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and there is 
much to be accomplished. For the estimated 
320,000 soldiers who have sustained a brain 
injury, the war will not end when the last shots 
are fired. For this reason, I applaud the committee 
for its work to make progress in treating 
veterans with TBI. 

As co-chair of the Congressional Brain Injury 
Task Force, I am proud to say that we 
have accomplished a lot over the past year in 
honoring our commitment to soldiers and veterans 
with brain injuries. The Defense Center 
of Excellence for Psychological Health and 
Traumatic Brain Injury opened its doors in November. 
The FY 2008 Defense Authorization 
established new TBI programs for rehabilitation, 
reintegration, research, and civilian-military 
cooperation. We reauthorized the Traumatic 
Brain Injury Act in April, establishing 
new connections between HHS, the Department 
of Defense, and the VA. And now this 
month, all soldiers will begin to receive pre-deployment 
cognitive assessments establishing 
individual baselines against which each soldier 
can be properly screened for a brain injury so 
that they may receive the care that they need 
and deserve. 

In this bill, the committee has recognized 
the need to improve care for veterans with TBI 
by fostering cooperation between DOD and 
VA through joint programs, by improving the 
ability to track patients diagnosed with TBI, 
and by encouraging systemic TBI screening 
for veterans. New research is, however, showing 
that there is considerable overlap in the 
occurrence of brain injury and mental health 
conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder. 
In fact, the Rand Corp. recently estimated that 
as many as 27 percent of soldiers with PTSD 
and depression have also sustained a brain 
injury. 

In light of these disturbing figures, Mr. 
Chairman, would you be willing to work in the 
Conference with the Senate on language to 
recognize the relationship between and co-oc


currence of TBI and PTSD among our armed 
services? 

I want to thank the gentleman from Texas 
and his staff for working so hard on this legislation 
and making a commitment to our injured 
veterans. Our soldiers have fulfilled their duties 
bravely and honorably, and they deserve 
nothing less than treatment and care that is 
commensurate with the heroic deeds they 
have undertaken. 

The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk 
will read. 

The Clerk read as follows: 

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Military 
Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations 
Act, 2009’’. 

Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. Mr. Chairman, 
I move that the Committee do 
now rise and report the bill back to the 
House with sundry amendments, with 
the recommendation that the amendments 
be agreed to and that the bill, as 
amended, do pass. 

The motion was agreed to. 

Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. 
WEINER) having assumed the chair, Mr. 
LYNCH, Acting Chairman of the Committee 
of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union, reported that that Committee, 
having had under consideration 
the bill (H.R. 6599) making appropriations 
for military construction, the Department 
of Veterans Affairs, and related 
agencies for the fiscal year ending 
September 30, 2009, and for other 
purposes, he reported the bill back to 
the House with sundry amendments 
adopted in the Committee of the 
Whole, with the recommendation that 
the amendments be agreed to and that 
the bill, as amended, do pass. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
House Resolution 1384, the previous 
question is ordered. 

Is a separate vote demanded on any 
amendment reported from the Committee 
of the Whole? If not, the Chair 
will put them en gros. 

The amendments were agreed to. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 

The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 

MOTION TO RECOMMIT 

Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I have a motion to recommit at the 
desk. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the bill? 

Mr. LEWIS of California. I am in its 
present form. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recommit. 


The Clerk read as follows: 

Mr. Lewis of California moves to recommit 
the bill H.R. 6599 to the Committee on Appropriations 
with instructions to report the 
same back to the House forthwith with the 
following amendment: 

At the end of the bill (before the short 
title), insert the following: 

SEC. ll. There is hereby enacted into law 

H.R. 6566 of the 110th Congress (the American 
Energy Act) as introduced on July 22, 2008. 
Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve a point of order on the 
gentleman’s motion. 


H7800 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE August 1, 2008 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman 
reserves a point of order. 

The gentleman from California is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 

b 1015 
Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today with a motion to recommit. 
But I want to say first to my 
colleagues that one of the reasons for 
my rising with this motion is because 
there seems to be a good deal of confusion 
on the part of at least my constituency, 
and my colleagues’ families 
and constituents at home may have the 
same kind of confusion. 
It seems that my people believe that 
this President does want to lead to a 
comprehensive energy independence 
policy that would include the availability 
to States to drill off their continental 
shelf, et cetera, to give us an 
adequate supply of oil to assure our energy 
independence. And yet those same 
people believe that it is the President’s 
Congress that is holding up such action. 
That is, many of them believe 
that the Congress, the House and the 
Senate, are controlled by his party. 
But that is not the case, and our people 
are confused. The Congress is controlled 
by the other party who are resisting 
those proposals that involve the 
ability to drill off the Outer Continental 
Shelf, to tap into shale, to develop 
a comprehensive policy that will 
lead to energy independence. My people 
are absolutely dying at the gas pump. 
Our small businesses are doing the 
same. 
So I have a motion to recommit, Mr. 
Speaker, with the term, I might add, 
‘‘promptly’’ in it to allow us to act immediately—
I misread it. It is not 
promptly, it is ‘‘forthwith.’’ So it 
would be implemented immediately. I 
did that because my colleagues on the 
other side have been complaining about 
the word ‘‘promptly.’’ We want you to 
be able to act very quickly, not just 
strike this on a point of order, but 
allow the people’s voices to be heard. 
Because I can tell you, when you go 
home, you are going to hear them if 
you strike this on a point of order. So 
back to the point, Mr. Speaker. 
This motion would enact the American 
Energy Act, a comprehensive solution 
to the energy crisis that is causing 
families to pay $4 per gallon for gasoline. 
Adoption of this motion will increase 
the supply of American-made 
energy and will relieve those families, 
those businesses, and my constituents 
at the gas pump. It will improve conservation 
efficiency, it will promote 
new and expanded technologies. Most 
of all, it will reduce America’s increasingly 
costly and dangerous dependence 
on foreign sources of energy. 
The minute we send them a message 
that we are serious about home supply, 
prices will crash. I can guarantee you 
that. 
We need to consider all solutions to 
achieve energy independence. I hope 
that as we prepare to head back to our 
districts for the month of August, we 

can go back to our constituents with 
the good news: We did something; rather 
than what this Congress has been 
doing in the past—nothing. 

I urge support for this motion to recommit. 


I yield time to my leader from Ohio, 
Mr. JOHN BOEHNER, the Republican 
leader. 

Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my 
colleague for yielding. 

Listen, America’s families and small 
businesses are suffering under the high 
cost of energy and the high cost of gasoline. 
High gasoline prices are crushing 
American families, they are hurting 
our schools, they are hurting seniors, 
and they are destroying jobs in America; 
and the American people expect us 
to do something about it. And over 
these last 10 weeks, what have we 
done? Nothing. 

The gentleman’s amendment offers 
the American Energy Plan, which is a 
comprehensive plan to encourage more 
conservation, more biofuels, alternative 
sources of energy, and, yes, 
more American-grown oil and gas. And 
all we’re asking of the majority Democrats 
in this chamber is to allow us to 
vote. That’s all we’re asking. We’re not 
asking you to vote for it. All we’re 
doing is, allow us a vote. Let the American 
people decide. 

Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the 
gentleman from Texas insist upon his 
point of order? 

Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. Yes, I do. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman 
will state his point of order. 

Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to rise in opposition 
first. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman 
continues to reserve his point 
of order. 

The gentleman is recognized for 5 
minutes. 

Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
we believe attaching nongermane 
amendments to this critical veterans’ 
bill could jeopardize its passage by unnecessarily 
delaying it or even grinding 
debate completely to a halt. This is unacceptable. 
My colleagues, those aren’t 
my words. Those are the words of the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars. 

Let me agree with my distinguished 
colleague. And let me say, last night at 
about midnight I told this chamber 
that Mr. LEWIS has been one of the 
champions throughout his public service 
career on behalf of our veterans and 
our troops. I meant it when I said it 
then, and I mean it when I say it again 
now. 

But let me say, having said that, no 
one is perfect. And on this motion, I 
think Mr. LEWIS is wrong. Seriously 
wrong. 

I do agree with this point he made 
just a moment ago; there may be confusion 
on this bill. There may be, so let 
me clear up the confusion. 

This is the 2009 fiscal year Military 
Construction and Veterans Affairs ap


propriations bill. If there is any confusion 
as to whether this is the 2009 fiscal 
year energy bill, get that out of your 
minds right now. 

This is a bill designed for the deadly 
serious purpose of honoring our veterans. 
Millions of them have put on our 
Nation’s uniform and gone into harm’s 
way in defense of your family and my 
family and the American family. This 
bill is deadly serious, because it provides 
training facilities and barracks 
for young men and women who are 
willing to go to Iraq and Afghanistan 
to answer their Nation’s call of duty. 

By making this motion, the gentleman 
knows, were it to pass, even 
though he knows also that it is non-
germane, it would complicate this bill, 
it would slow down this bill, it could 
well kill this bill because of the honest 
differences on the energy issue. 

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. All 
Members are reminded that they may 
engage in debate only when recognized 
by the Chair or yielded to. 

Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
if my colleagues don’t want to listen 
to my words, let me offer them 
some other people’s words. 

‘‘It is imperative this bill is not delayed 
by unrelated and unnecessary 
amendments.’’ That came from 
AMVETS. 

How about what the Disabled American 
Veterans said about this kind of 
measure. They said, ‘‘This bill provides 
the means to serve and care for sick 
and disabled veterans, provide housing 
facilities for military families, and to 
fund the activities of several other 
agencies that affect veterans, a most 
generous and necessary act.’’ They 
have gone on to say they do not want 
delay on this important bill. 

Mr. LEWIS of California. Would the 
gentleman yield? 

Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. I would like 
to finish my remarks. I respected the 
gentleman’s right to his remarks. 

Let me go to another statement 
made by the Disabled American Veterans. 
They say, ‘‘It is our strongest 
recommendation that this bill be unfettered 
with nongermane amendments.’’ 


My colleagues, we have a very simple 
choice at this moment. We can choose 
to stand with the Republican leadership 
that chose to add this partisan 
motion at the end of a long bipartisan 
process; or we can stand with millions 
of American veterans, as represented 
by the statements against this very 
kind of motion, by the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, 
and the AMVETS. 

I don’t know about some of my colleagues 
on the Republican side of the 
aisle, but as for me, that’s an easy 
choice. I’m going to stand with America’s 
veterans. I’m going to stand with 
our troops in harm’s way who deserve 
the funding in this bill as soon as possible. 


Mr. LEWIS of California. Would the 
gentleman yield? 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7801 

Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. Out of respect 
to the gentleman, I will yield. 

Mr. LEWIS of California. I consider 
that to be a great courtesy for your 
yielding. 

I know that you know that I am the 
Member who carried the amendment 
that increased the mileage reimbursement 
for the veterans that is in this 
bill. I do know they had that problem, 
because all those veterans who you 
mentioned in those quotes are the 
same ones that are also paying $4 a gallon. 
They would love to have this bill 
reduce that burden. 

Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. Reclaiming 
my time, Mr. Speaker, I think the 
views of the Disabled American Veterans, 
the VFW and the AMVETS are 
very clear. They didn’t say they 
strongly oppose this kind of a motion; 
they vehemently oppose it, because it 
could harm millions of America’s veterans. 


So make your choice. You can choose 
to stick with the Republican leadership 
on a clearly partisan nongermane motion, 
or you can stand up for America’s 
veterans. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 

POINT OF ORDER 

Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I make a point of order against the 
motion to recommit with instructions, 
because it includes legislation and is 
not in order under clause 2 of rule XXI. 

Mr. Speaker, the gentleman’s motion 
to instruct proposes legislation in an 
appropriations bill and would not be in 
order in the Committee of the Whole 
pursuant to clause 2 of rule XXI. I ask 
for a ruling from the Chair. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman 
raises a point of order. Does 
any Member seek to be heard on the 
point of order? Hearing none, the Chair 
is prepared to rule. 

The gentleman from Texas makes a 
point of order that the instructions in 
the motion to recommit constitute legislation 
in violation of clause 2 of rule 
XXI. 

The Chair finds that the instructions 
propose the enactment of legislation 
directly amending existing law. 

The instructions therefore constitute 
legislation in violation of clause 2 of 
rule XXI. 

The point of order is sustained and 
the motion is not in order. 

Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the 
Chair. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is, Shall the decision of the 
Chair stand as the judgment of the 
House? 

MOTION TO TABLE 

Mr. EDWARDS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I move to table the appeal of the 
ruling of the Chair. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to table. 

The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.

DESIGNATING SENATOR PRYOR AS 
ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had the 
good fortune in the Senate of serving 
with David Pryor, the Senator from 
Arkansas. He was a member of the Finance 
Committee and other very responsible 
positions, including the Ethics 
Committee. He was, I believe, what 
the stereotype of a Senator should be. 
He worked hard and he is very smart. 
He was so easy to get along with. I do 
not think I have ever served with a better 
legislator in my life than David 
Pryor. 

Unfortunately for Arkansas and our 
country, he was taken ill. He had a 
very severe heart attack and decided 
not to run for reelection. He is doing 
well. He is healthy. I talk to him on occasion. 
Whenever I go to Arkansas, I 
see him. But what a wonderful man to 
know. 

The reason I mention that, fortunately 
for the people of Arkansas, his 

son MARK has replaced him. MARK has 
all the same characteristics as his dad. 
He is a man with a lot of humility. He 
works very hard. He knows the legislative 
process. He was attorney general 
of the State of Arkansas. He is an outstanding 
lawyer. 

There were a lot of reasons we were 
able to complete that most significant 
legislation last night, the Consumer 
Product Safety Modernization Act. But 
it is the most sweeping improvement of 
the law that has taken place since the 
law was passed some 40 years ago. It 
was done under the direction of Senator 
INOUYE. But Senator INOUYE gives 
credit to MARK PRYOR who worked so 
hard to arrive at the solution he did, 
which was a piece of legislation that 
passed overwhelmingly in this body. 

So, Mr. President, with that brief 
background, I ask unanimous consent 
that Senator PRYOR be designated as 
Acting President pro tempore of the 
Senate for the purpose of signing the 
conference report to accompany H.R. 
4040, the Consumer Product Safety 
Modernization Act. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 


Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The clerk will call the roll. 

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 

Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

UNITED STATES ECONOMY 

Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday 
the Government released the second 
quarter performance of the U.S. economy, 
and I am sorry to say the report 
looks dismal. I, along with the rest of 
Americans, am outraged that Congress 
will depart shortly for a 5-week recess 
without addressing the most pressing 
issue of this Congress: our ailing economy 
and in particular energy. During 
this past month, we have passed bills 
to provide $50 billion for support of 
international programs to combat HIV/ 
AIDS, for Medicare, and to improve 
FISA. This past week, we finally 
passed a bill that addresses a sector of 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7985 

our economy by revamping Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac. I certainly believe we 
can and should have done more than 
that. 

In November of 2006, my party lost 
the majority in Congress, in both the 
House of Representatives and in the 
Senate. The Democrats ran on a platform 
of change, what they called ‘‘A 
New Direction For America.’’ The 
Democrats pledged to push forward a 
100-hour agenda that touted a change 
in ethics, an increase in the minimum 
wage, and a rollback in subsidies for 
the oil and gas industry. Look where 
that ‘‘direction’’ has led us. The price 
of energy has skyrocketed, the housing 
market has deteriorated, and the unemployment 
rate is on the rise. Across 
the Nation, we are feeling the effects of 
the crumbling economy. Yesterday, 
Bennigans and Steak & Ale restaurants 
have filed for bankruptcy, and 
Starbucks has recently announced the 
closing of 600 stores across America. It 
is time for the majority to wake up and 
smell the coffee. 

Viewing this chart, it is no wonder 
why the congressional approval ratings 
are at an alltime low, at 12 percent. 
Congressional approval: 12 percent. 
Congress has failed to act when Americans 
need it the most. 

At the end of 2006, when the Republicans 
controlled Congress, the average 
retail price of regular unleaded gasoline, 
according to the Energy Information 
Administration, was $2.59. Look 
where it is today. 

In June of this year, the average 
price of regular unleaded gasoline hit 
an average of $4.06. Our friends on the 
other side have done absolutely nothing 
to address the rising costs of energy, 
and we are going home without 
having done so. We have proposed increasing 
the supply off our coasts, extending 
the expiring energy tax incentives, 
and reducing our dependence on 
foreign oil by providing alternative energy 
resources. The majority refuses to 
provide any solid bipartisan solutions 
because they keep insisting on their 
perverse let’s-grow-the-Government, 
pay-as-you-go rules and combating the 
oil and gas industry as though they are 
the evil cause of everything. The fact is 
the Government does not produce one 
drop of oil. It does not drill one exploration 
well. It does not refine even 1 
gallon of gasoline, and it doesn’t build 
1 foot of pipeline. Somehow, though, 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle think every answer to dropping 
gas prices is more Government—more 
Government moratoria on drilling, 
more taxes on energy companies, more 
regulation of the commodity markets, 
more moratoriums on the development 
of oil shale, where we have somewhere 
between 800 billion and 2 trillion barrels 
of oil that can be recovered. It is 
doable. Estonia has been doing it for 
the last 80 years. Brazil has been doing 
it for the last three decades. We can do 
it, but there is a moratorium that 
doesn’t expire until September, and 
now the Democrats want to put an


other moratorium on it—just on preparing 
the rules pursuant to which we 
can develop these vast resources that 
would help bring prices down. It 
wouldn’t happen overnight, but I tell 
you one thing, if we went and tried to 
do all these things and we announced 
we were going to do them, I believe gas 
prices would automatically come down 
quite a bit more than they are right 
now. 

This past week, the majority leader 
brought a bill to the floor to curtail oil 
price speculation, and while this was a 
start, my party tried to amend this bill 
to provide real solutions, ranging from 
expanding offshore drilling to boosting 
oil shale production. We were prevented 
from offering these various 
amendments, which was an opportunity 
to increase energy supply and to 
send the rest of the world a message 
that we are going to get serious about 
helping ourselves instead of sending 
$700 billion every year off some shore 
for offshore oil. 

Across the Capitol, the House refuses 
to even bring up legislation involving 
offshore drilling. I do not know how I 
can return home to my home State of 
Utah and explain to constituents such 
as Bill Howard, a farmer who has to increase 
the price of his cattle and hogs 
to combat fuel costs, that we cannot do 
anything about the soaring gas prices 
unless it is paid for and hurts the oil 
and gas industry. Americans need affordable 
energy now. 

If we look at the results of Democratic 
policies on job growth in our 
country, we are met with the same disappointment. 
Here is where we are. The 
unemployment rate in 2006 was 4.4 percent. 
Today it is up to 5.5 percent. 

Less jobs means people spend less. 
When we spend less, companies start 
cutting back, laying off employees, and 
reducing employee salaries. This 
causes us to spend even less and the vicious 
economic cycle continues. We 
need to put more money back into the 
taxpayers’ pockets over a long period 
of time in order to create a virtuous 
economic cycle. Among the tax extenders 
bill, which has failed to pass the 
Senate again and again, is the research 
tax credit. Seventy percent of research 
tax credit dollars are used for wages of 
R&D employees. That is creating jobs. 
I have been the champion of the R&D 
tax credit, along with Senator BAUCUS, 
for years. 

We should provide tax relief not 
through economic stimulus packages 
or on a year-to-year basis but over a 
long period of time so the taxpayers 
can depend on this relief. That is why 
it is so important that when we talk 
about economic stimulus, we should 
look at solutions rather than rebate 
checks and bailouts, such as repealing 
the alternative minimum tax and making 
certain tax cuts permanent such as 
the research tax credit. 

Looking toward the housing market, 
we still are puzzled why the majority 
has not provided solutions to help the 
economy. We have been hit hard by the 

housing market in my home State. St. 
George, in the southwestern part of 
Utah, and Provo, UT, were among the 
top ten fastest-growing metro areas in 
the United States between 2000 and 
2006, with a growth of 39.8 percent and 

25.9 percent respectively. As you can 
see, our economy has all kinds of foreclosures; 
in Utah we are up to 141 percent. 
That is twice the national increase 
from a year ago. 
Last week, my friends on the other 
side of the aisle pushed through a housing 
bill that some estimate will provide 
a temporary financial housing 
lifeline by benefiting only 13 percent of 
the estimated 300,000 homeowners who 
will likely lose their homes in the next 
year. I supported earlier versions of the 
bill, but as it moved through the process 
and took on new provisions, my reservations 
grew. There is more to be 
said about the bill than I have time for 
now, but I have a statement in the 
RECORD on the subject. Let me say I 
think too many people and organizations 
that do not deserve it will be 
bailed out by what is now housing law. 

I am also concerned that some of the 
provisions in the bill are shortsighted. 
For example, we created a new regulator 
for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
which is fine, but then we created what 
could possibly become a huge taxpayer-
funded backstop, to put it nicely. Some 
have proposed that we cut the Government’s 
ties to Fannie and Freddie, 
make them truly private companies, 
and incentivize more competition. 
Maybe we need to start the discussion 
now so taxpayers are not on the hook 
should future crises arise. We are on 
the brink of a recession and we need 
leadership. 

The Democrats’ ‘‘New Direction For 
America’’ has led us down a road to 
economic hardship and Americans deserve 
to have the economy driving on 
all cylinders. With the government-
sponsored housing enterprises, high energy 
and food prices, and the instability 
of financial institutions, we are 
in a state of economic slowdown. But 
there is hope. 

Much like today, when I came to the 
Senate over 30 years ago, the unemployment 
rate was rising, inflation was 
accelerating, and the GDP was beginning 
to decline. The economy was a 
major problem facing Americans. In response, 
we provided long-term solutions 
to our ailing economy by lowering 
taxes and increasing investment 
and growth. While the economy today 
is bleak, I believe there is hope because 
we have been here before. However, I do 
not know why the majority has not addressed 
this dire situation before adjourning. 


There are some real problems facing 
the American economy, and together 
we can deal with them. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The Senator has 1 minute remaining. 


Mr. HATCH. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Most of these problems are self-inflicted, 
due to some major financial 


S7986 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

mistakes in our country. Congress has 
passed some legislation aimed at improving 
our economy, but these short-
term, bandaid solutions will eventually 
exacerbate the increasing deficit, and 
we will find ourselves back in the same 
situation. More spending certainly is 
not the answer. 

When we return from our August recess, 
I encourage Congress to debate 
how we can fix our ailing economy. I 
believe we can take steps toward reducing 
unemployment, slowing inflation, 
and increasing investment and growth. 
I also believe we need to look at reforming 
our Tax Code. Our tax system 
has become burdensome and overly 
complicated. It discourages investment 
at a time when we desperately need it 
most. For too long we have delayed addressing 
our economy, and we owe a lot 
better service to our fellow Americans. 

I yield the floor. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The Senator from Rhode Island is 
recognized. 

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous 
consent to speak for 10 minutes as in 
morning business. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 


OIL COMPANY PROFITS 

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Let me begin by 
saying, as we leave for our August recess 
very shortly, what a pleasure it 
has been for me to serve with the distinguished 
Senator from Utah on the 
Judiciary Committee during these first 
months of my first term in this body. I 
would respond to what he has said by 
suggesting that if he and his colleagues 
would actually let us lead, we would be 
able to solve a lot of the problems he 
discussed and that were indicated on 
those graphs. However, instead of letting 
us lead, they have embarked on a 
strategy of creating gridlock in this institution 
with—I think at this point we 
are at 92 or more filibusters—which is 
the world record in the history of this 
country—and climbing. I think what 
has happened to this body is my colleagues 
on the other side have made 
the decision that the record of George 
Bush is hopeless, the Republican message 
is shot, and their only salvation is 
to call down a pox on both our Houses 
and try to disable this institution, try 
to prevent us from doing essentially 
anything. It also has the added benefit 
of allowing the Executive more leeway, 
and it confers more power on George 
Bush, which I think is a mistake, given 
the way the record has shown his judgments 
have worked out. 

For instance, take a look at what has 
happened in the Bush economy every 
day and getting worse and worse. Since 
George Bush and DICK CHENEY took office 
in 2001, wages in America have remained 
stagnant, as the very distinguished 
Senator from Ohio knows very 
well. Wages in America remain stagnant, 
oil and gas prices have risen 
sharply, and troubles in the housing 
market have made it harder and harder 
for families to stay in their homes. One 

would not have thought very long ago 
that America was a country in which 
tens of thousands of Americans would 
be thrown out of their own homes, but 
there we are. 

Even those well off enough to own 
stock have seen the consequences of 
the Bush economy. In the Clinton 
years, the Dow Jones industrial average 
climbed 129 percent. In the Bush 
years, it has climbed exactly 0.7 percent. 
I ask my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle whether they think 
their investor friends would prefer 129 
percent capital gains and then paying a 
fair tax on those capital gains or 
whether they would prefer having big 
fights about what the capital gains tax 
rate is, but nobody makes any money. 

While American families and American 
workers struggle in the Bush 
economy, there is one special, favored 
industry that is laughing all the way to 
the bank. Eight years of two oilmen in 
the White House has brought over $4-a-
gallon gasoline for American consumers 
and absolutely grotesque profits 
for the biggest oil companies. 

Yesterday, once again, the largest of 
these international giants—ExxonMobil—
announced recordbreaking profits. 
ExxonMobil’s second-quarter profits 
were the highest in the company’s 
history. They were the highest in the 
history of the entire oil industry. In 
fact, Exxon’s $11.7 billion profits for 
this last quarter were the highest corporate 
profits in the history of the 
United States. These profits, indeed, 
are the highest in the history of the 
universe as we know it. 

Think about that: $11.7 billion in just 
3 months. The U.S. Department of 
Transportation estimates that there 
are 250 million passenger vehicles in 
the United States. Exxon’s $11.7 billion 
second-quarter profits amount to a 
quarterly tax of $47 on every car and 
truck in the country. That is just for 
one quarter. If you have ever wondered 
where the $60 or the $80 or even the $100 
that it might cost to fill your tank 
goes, take a look at this. Gas prices are 
definitely going up; there is no doubt 
about that. We all experience the pain 
at the pump. But compared to how gas 
prices are going up, look at what is 
happening to oil company profits. As 
gas prices have risen, oil company profits 
have soared. If Exxon continues to 
reap profits at this level, in 2008 alone, 
you will pay for every car a $188 oil 
profits fee to ExxonMobil per car—$188 
on every car in America—for the profit. 

That is not counting the hundreds of 
billions of dollars raked in by the four 
other major international oil companies 
doing business in our country. 

We are facing a true energy crisis. Instead 
of working with us to solve it, 
our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle continue to fight for oil company 
profits. 

Drilling off of our pristine coasts— 
and I come from the ocean State of 
Rhode Island—won’t produce a drop of 
oil for a decade and won’t significantly 
lower gas prices even then. These facts 

have no affect on our colleagues. Make 
no mistake about it, more drilling 
means higher profits for Exxon, Shell, 
BP, and especially for DICK CHENEY’s 
former employer, Halliburton, which 
provides drilling products and services. 

Exxon is committed to an oil economy 
that has no future for this country. 
They earned $11.7 billion in profits 
in the last 3 months, but in the 4 years 
between 2003 and 2007, Exxon spent just 
$20 million on research and development 
of alternative and renewable 
transportation fuel technologies. That 
is $20 million in 4 years, which is $5 
million a year. That $5 million a year 
is $1.25 million a quarter. If you compare 
$1.25 million a quarter to $11.7 billion 
in profits, what you find out is 
that for every $10,000 in profit 
ExxonMobil makes, it spends $1 on alternative 
fuels. I am sure that in Ohio 
the Presiding Officer is seeing the same 
advertisements we are seeing in Rhode 
Island—wonderful Exxon ads with scientists 
and molecules, telling us how 
they are investing in the future. But it 
is $1 for every $10,000 they put in their 
pockets. 

A recent Wall Street Journal article 
reported that the big oil companies 
spent $52.5 million on advertisements 
to burnish their images in the first 
quarter of the year. That is an 
annualized rate of $200 million in ads. 
Of course, many of these environmental 
ads say: We are green now, just 
watch us. Well, if you assume that of 
that $52.5 million, a quarter of it was 
Exxon, that is $12.5 million. If you assume 
that just a quarter of that 12.5 
was spent on green ads and the rest on 
other stuff, that is $3 million. That 
means they spend three times as much 
advertising their green research as 
they do actually doing their green research. 
It is the biggest sham in the 
world. 

I hope when Americans see these ads 
in magazines and elsewhere they know 
they are being had. It is $1 in research, 
$3 in advertising about it, and $10,000 in 
profits. That is the ratio. That is not a 
ratio anybody should be very proud of. 
If only Exxon and the other oil giants 
would devote some of their advertising 
budget to R&D, then we might be better 
off. We don’t need sham solutions. 
We need results. 

Yesterday, I signed on to a letter authored 
by our assistant majority leader, 
Senator DURBIN of Illinois, to request 
of President Bush to release 
about 10 percent—or 70 million bar-
rels—from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
That sale would immediately 
lower gas prices and generate over $8 
billion, which is money that could be 
used to invest in alternative sources of 
energy for real—not the phony show 
ExxonMobil is putting on—so that we 
can finally move away from our oil-addicted 
economy. But so far, no action. 
Indeed, yesterday, we tried to pass a 
Defense authorization bill to support 
our troops in the field, in harm’s way. 
The Republicans voted against the bill, 
abandoning our troops for big oil. Big

oil is making big money, and that is 
the Republicans’ priority. I urge President 
Bush to end the rhetoric, put the 
troops first, get off of big oil’s wagon, 
and let’s get together to solve this 
problem for real. 

I thank the chair and yield the floor. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

f 

FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, all 
across America today, people are looking 
to Capitol Hill with astonishment. 
They are wondering how it is even possible 
that lawmakers who have been 
hearing from their constituents for 
months about the burden of record-
high gas prices could fail to work out a 
sensible response. 
I don’t blame them. High gas prices 
have triggered a crisis in American 
homes and in the broader economy, and 
the American people have a right to expect 
their elected representatives to do 
something about it. 
Every crisis is a call for leadership, 
and this one was no different. This was 
an opportunity for the Democrats who 
control Congress to demonstrate courage 
and resolve. They squandered it. In 
their hunt for more seats in Congress 
and control of the White House, they 
took the path of least resistance. They 
decided that they could increase their 
hold on Congress by avoiding tough 
votes, and then blaming the mess that 
followed on a party that wasn’t even in 
charge. 
While Republicans were working out 
a legislation solution that addressed 
high gas prices head on, Democrats embarked 
on a concerted effort of pointing 
fingers and casting blame. Americans 
were looking for answers, and the 
Democrat answer was to make everyone 
accountable but themselves. 
First came the energy producers, who 
were threatened with higher taxes that 
would have passed along to consumers, 
making the problem worse. Then came 
the foreign oil producers, who were 
threatened with lawsuits unless they 
increased production, even though 
America sits on massive energy reserves 
that dwarf their own. 
Finally, it was the speculators. Citing 
the testimony of a lawyer whose 
previous statements on energy provoked 
a stinging bipartisan rebuke, the 
Democrats claimed that writing a few 
new regulations for speculators would 
solve the energy crisis. Republicans 
agree that we need greater transparency 
in the market and more cops 
on the beat. But the notion that speculators 
alone have led to a dramatic 
surge in gas prices is, according to 
every serious person, completely and 
totally absurd. 
The chairman of the Federal Reserve 
has rejected the idea that speculators 
alone were the cause of the oil shock. 
Warren Buffett, a prominent Democrat 
and perhaps the most successful investor 
of our generation, has said specu


lators alone are not the problem. The 
27-member International Energy Agency 
said speculators alone are not the 
problem. T. Boone Pickens, who has 
been cited by both sides in this debate, 
has said unequivocally that speculators 
alone were not the problem. 

When asked about high gas prices, all 
the experts seem to agree on two 
things: first, that speculators alone are 
not the problem. And second, that the 
high price of gas is primarily the result 
of increased demand and static supply. 
Increase supply, and the price of gas 
will go down. Keep it static and prices 
will continue to rise. That is why even 
the liberal New York Times derided the 
Democrats’ speculators-only approach 
as a ‘‘misbegotten plan.’’ 

Republicans didn’t invent the law of 
supply and demand. It’s as old as commerce 
itself. And it has the virtue of 
being perfectly straightforward: any 
serious proposal for bringing down high 
gas prices would have to increase supply. 
And any serious proposal that 
aims to decrease our dependence on 
Middle East oil would have to increase 
supply here at home. 

Every expert in America tells us that 
Americans will be dependent on fossil-
fuels for decades to come. And until 
the day when we’re all plugging in our 
cars or using alternative fuels, Americans 
can’t be expected to shoulder the 
crushing burden of ever increasing gas 
prices. Congress has a responsibility to 
act, and that action must involve a 
comprehensive approach. 

This is why Republicans put together 
a solution to this crisis that seeks, 
first of all, to accelerate the day when 
America will no longer be dependent on 
foreign sources of oil. We do this in our 
plan by addressing not only the principal 
cause of rising fuel prices—insufficient 
supply—but also by promoting 
new energy technologies, such as plug-
in hybrid cars and trucks. 

We heard the concerns of the American 
people, brought together the best 
ideas from both sides of the aisle, and 
pressed forward, confident that here 
was a solution that would be embraced 
by Americans and acceptable to a majority 
in Congress who could claim 
shared credit for the result. But, in the 
end, the Democrat Leadership showed 
it would rather cast blame than share 
success. 

Americans are wondering why the 
Democrat Leadership voted to leave 
town last night without proposing a 
comprehensive solution of their own to 
$4-a-gallon gasoline. And they deserve 
an honest answer. The moment that 
gas prices became a major issue here in 
Washington, Democrats started to 
build a protective blockade around 
their Presidential nominee. 

Rather than come up with a comprehensive 
solution that would do 
something to lower the price of gas, 
they set out to insulate their candidate 
from ever having to take a difficult 
vote on the issue. They have done this 
because their nominee opposes expanding 
the domestic energy supply. Recall 

that his initial response to high energy 
costs was that Americans would have 
to learn to turn their air conditioners 
down and consume fewer calories. 

He has stated publicly that high gas 
prices are only a problem because 
America didn’t have enough time to 
adjust to them. And just this week the 
junior Senator from Illinois unveiled 
his own comprehensive solution to the 
high price of gas: ‘‘We could save all 
the oil that they’re talking about getting 
off drilling,’’ he said, ‘‘If everybody 
was just inflating their tires and 
getting regular tune-ups.’’ 

This is the proposal of the man that 
Democrats in Congress want to lead us 
through the Nation’s energy crisis: regular 
tune-ups. This is the answer the 
junior Senator from Illinois has proposed 
to the patients at the Woodland 
Dialysis Center in Elizabethtown, KY, 
who are now limiting their treatments 
because they can’t afford the cost of 
getting to them. This is Senator 
OBAMA’s answer to $4-a-gallon gas: 
issue some new regulations and go to 
Jiffy Lube. 

Add it to the growing list of laughably 
inadequate proposals that our 
Democrat friends have brought forward 
over the last few months. Some of 
them wanted to sue foreign countries 
as a way of forcing them to open up 
their supplies. Others proposed tax incentives 
for riding bicycles to work. 
But Senate Democrats really outdid 
themselves earlier this summer when 
they showed off a two-seat, electric-
powered Tessla Roadster. It gets excellent 
mileage, and any American family 
can buy one of its own for a mere 
$109,000. These are the kinds of solutions 
we have heard from the other 
side. 

Over the last few weeks, the time for 
real action arrived. And when it did, 
the Democratic leadership blocked and 
stalled every attempt to advance a real 
solution to the energy crisis. They canceled 
appropriations hearings out of 
fear that a deep-sea exploration 
amendment to lower gas prices would 
be offered. They offered a speculation-
only bill, which no serious person 
thinks is in itself the answer to $4-a-
gallon gas. And then over the last 7 
days, they tried to take us off the issue 
of high gas prices seven times. Seven 
times they have tried to take us off the 
issue of high gas prices, taunting Republicans 
for standing on principle 
rather than taking the bait. In every 
case, Republicans refused to turn their 
backs on the people at the pump. 

These last few weeks were a time for 
decision, and the Democrats made 
theirs. When Americans demanded action, 
the Democrats played games. 
They changed the topic so the man 
they want to lead our country would 
not have to make a public decision 
about high gas prices. 

Some on the other side may think 
this kind of behavior is acceptable. 
They might think it makes sense to 
block the Senate minority from offering 
a balanced solution to high gas

prices in order to protect one Senator 
and the 20 percent of Americans who 
think we should not use more energy 
from American soil. We couldn’t disagree 
more. 

When faced with a crisis, the Democratic 
leadership opted instead to follow 
the political playbook of the senior 
Senator from New York who recently 
told a reporter that Democrats should 
wait until after Inauguration Day— 
when he hopes to see a Democrat in the 
White House—before doing anything 
about high gas prices. 

This is precisely the kind of statement 
that frustrates the American people. 
They have waited for a solution 
long enough. They should not have to 
wait another day. 

Mr. President, I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The clerk will call the roll. 

The assistant legislative clerk proceeded 
to call the roll. 

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 


MIDWESTERN DISASTER RELIEF 

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for 
the benefit of leaders’ offices, after I 
am done speaking about the flood situation 
in Iowa, I have been asked by the 
leader to make a unanimous consent 
request in regard to E-Verify. So I 
want to notice the offices about what I 
am going to do. It will be down the 
road, in half an hour or so. 

Mr. President, last night I came to 
the floor to ask for unanimous consent 
on the tax bill we referred to as the 
Midwest flood disaster tax relief package. 
I was denied unanimous consent to 
bring that up. I did not make a long 
justification for the necessity of doing 
that, but I wish to speak to that point 
now. I am not going to further ask 
unanimous consent the same as I did 
last night; I am just going to speak 
about why I did it last night and why 
it was essential. 

There is one thing I want to put in 
the RECORD at this point, and it is in 
regard to one of the points that was 
made by the Senator from Illinois last 
night, Mr. DURBIN, the Democratic 
whip. He said one of the reasons for denying 
my request for the tax relief 
package I am talking about for flood 
victims in the Midwest is because similar 
provisions were contained in S. 
3335, the Jobs, Energy, Families, and 
Disaster Relief Act of 2008, and that 
bill did not get 60 votes. Obviously, it 
didn’t get 60 votes for the reason a lot 
of other bills have not gotten 60 votes 
on the floor of the Senate: We in the 
minority want to stay on the No. 1 
problem affecting this country; that is, 
the high cost of gasoline and the energy 
crisis that is facing the Nation. 
We want the majority party to give us 
opportunities to offer amendments to 
increase the supply of energy in this 
country as opposed to paying $140 a 

barrel to buy oil and import it from 
overseas, giving money to nations that 
want to train terrorists to kill Americans. 
That is the reason S. 3335 did not 
get 60 votes. So we are technically on 
the Energy bill. 

But one of the things he said about 
that bill was to leave the impression 
that S. 3335 did everything that needs 
to be done for the disaster relief in the 
Midwest, and it doesn’t, and I made 
that point last night, so I am not going 
to repeat that. 

But even if S. 3335 had passed, we had 
previously had a Statement of Administration 
Policy, and I am only going 
to quote one sentence from a longer 
Statement of Administration Policy 
that I am going to put in the RECORD, 
and that sentence is this: ‘‘However, 
due to other objections to the bill, 
should it be presented to the President 
in its current form, his senior advisers 
would recommend a veto.’’ So I think 
that when we are under a situation 
where we have the trauma of floods and 
people being homeless because of the 
flooding situation in the Midwest, it 
doesn’t do much good to pass a piece of 
legislation that is going to be vetoed 
by the White House anyway. 

The point I was trying to make last 
night is that we shouldn’t be adjourning 
for our summer August break and 
not taking care of things in the Midwest 
the very same way we took care 
of the situation for New Orleans caused 
by Katrina. Of course, the point is that 
the legislation we seek for the Midwest 
is the same as the legislation we 
sought and we actually accomplished 
for New Orleans. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
to have printed in the RECORD the 
full Statement of Administration Policy 
from which I quoted. 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 

EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESI


DENT, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT 

AND BUDGET, 

Washington, DC, July 30, 2008. 

STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 

S. 3335—JOBS, ENERGY, FAMILIES, AND DISASTER 
RELIEF ACT OF 2008 
The Administration supports responsible 
and timely alternative minimum tax (AMT) 
relief as proposed in the President’s Budget. 
Congress should act quickly to protect 26 
million American taxpayers from an unwelcome 
tax increase and to avoid repeating the 
unnecessary administrative complexity 
caused by congressional delay in 2007. In addition, 
the Administration supports the extension 
of the tax credit for research and experimentation 
(R&E) expenses, incentives 
for charitable giving, subpart F active financing 
and look-through exceptions, and 
the new markets tax credit. In its FY 2009 
Budget, the Administration proposed that 
several of these provisions be made permanent, 
including the R&E tax credit. However, 
due to other objections to the bill, should it 
be presented to the President in its current 
form, his senior advisors would recommend a 
veto. 

The Administration strongly supports continuation 
of tax incentives for renewable energy, 
and in fact the President recently proposed 
a more effective approach that would 

reform today’s complicated mix of incentives 
to make the commercialization and use of 
new, lower emission technologies more competitive. 
The President’s proposal would consolidate 
this mix into a single expanded program 
that would be carbon-weighted, technology-
neutral, and long-lasting. This policy 
would make lower emission power sources 
less expensive relative to higher emission 
sources while taking into account our Nation’s 
energy security needs. It would take 
the government out of picking technology 
winners and losers in this emerging market. 
And it would provide a positive and reliable 
market signal for technology investment and 
investment in domestic manufacturing capacity 
and infrastructure. 

Overall, the Administration does not believe 
that efforts to avoid tax increases on 
Americans need to be coupled with provisions 
to increase revenue. Although the Senate 
has avoided pairing AMT relief with tax 
increases, the bill contains a host of objectionable 
provisions. The Administration 
strongly opposes the provision in the bill 
that would subject U.S. companies to continued 
double taxation by further delaying the 
effect of new rules for allocating worldwide 
interest for foreign tax credit purposes. The 
Administration also strongly opposes the 
provision in the bill that would treat U.S. 
citizens with deferred compensation from 
certain employers—in all industries—more 
unfavorably than other U.S. citizens. Together, 
these provisions would increase tax 
burdens, undermine the competitiveness of 

U.S. workers and businesses, and could have 
adverse effects on the U.S. economy. The Administration 
also opposes the continued expansion 
of tax-credit bonds and the reinstatement 
of the exclusion from tax of 
amounts received under qualified group legal 
services plans. The Administration urges 
Congress to eliminate all such provisions 
from the final bill. 
The Administration also strongly opposes 
the provision in the bill to increase cash balances 
in the Highway Account of the Highway 
Trust Fund by transferring $8 billion 
from the General Fund. It is a longstanding 
principle that highway construction and 
maintenance should be funded by those who 
use the highway system. Instead, this provision 
is both a gimmick and a dangerous 
precedent that shifts costs from users to taxpayers 
at large. Moreover, the provision 
would unnecessarily increase the deficit and 
would place any hope of future, responsible 
constraints on highway spending in jeopardy. 
This provision is unnecessary, because 
the Administration has proposed a responsible 
alternative that protects taxpayers. 

Finally, the Administration objects to a 
budget gimmick in the bill that would raise 
revenues by modifying the tax treatment of 
deferred compensation over the current 
budget window, but allow this provision to 
expire so that it, like the new rules for allocating 
worldwide interest for foreign tax 
credit purposes, will return to be available as 
a ‘‘revenue-raiser’’ in next year’s ten-year 
budget window. These types of gimmicks, 
done for so-called ‘‘pay as you go’’ reasons, 
harm the integrity of the tax code and increase 
uncertainty for taxpayers. 

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before 
I speak to the point, just so you 
know, in Iowa the flood situation is 
very much in the headlines. I think one 
of the problems we are having in the 
Midwest, in getting Congress to pay attention 
to the problems that remain 
from the flooding of June, is that it is 
not constantly on television. It is not 
on television all the time. Of course, 
for 2 months, 3 months, the situation 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7989 

in New Orleans was constantly on television, 
and Congress responded. 

Mr. President, I see the whip here, 
and maybe I said something to which 
he wants to react. If he does, I would be 
happy to yield for that purpose. 

Mr. DURBIN. I will wait until the 
Senator has completed. I would like to 
make a statement. 

Mr. GRASSLEY. Anyway, we have 
here in the Des Moines Register a headline 
that says, ‘‘Storm Hit One in Five 
School Districts,’’ and then it has reports 
on how much it is going to cost 
to fix the schools. We have another 
headline here that says, ‘‘At Least $30 
Million Needed to Repair Roads,’’ as an 
example. 

Then we have a statement that was 
printed in the Davenport newspaper 
that was written by Charlotte Eby. I 
am not going to quote the whole thing. 
I just want to speak to parts of it. 

While Congress puts off consideration of 
the flood relief bill, it looks like the Iowa 
legislature will be rolling up its sleeves to 
help out Iowa flood victims. 

It speaks about a growing sense that 
the Iowa legislature has to step in. 

The delay of a Federal response by Congress 
could also push back the State response, 
a development that left Iowans 
angry. 

It quotes the minority leader of the 
Iowa senate. Ron Wieck, Republican of 
Sioux City, said action cannot wait, 
and if that means a special session, he 
is for it. It doesn’t quote him, but it 
says he is appalled that Congress will 
go home for the summer recess without 
passing a Federal flood relief package 
when floods left people in the Midwest 
homeless. 

Then the last paragraph is not anybody’s 
quote except the author’s, Charlotte 
Eby: 

Maybe the U.S. Senate majority leader 
Harry Reid and House speaker Nancy Pelosi 
ought to walk the streets of Cedar Rapids. 
They would think twice about heading home 
for their August recess without lending a 
helping hand. 

Then I have a quote from Congressman 
KING, who went to Cedar Rapids, I 
think, as recently as Monday of this 
week. He says: 

This is Katrina. I have walked into and out 
of those buildings (in New Orleans) and I tell 
you, you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. 


He means telling the difference between 
the destruction that went on in 
New Orleans in the 2005 hurricane and 
what happened in Cedar Rapids in June 
when it was hit by a 500-year flood. 

I do applaud Senator OBAMA because 
he was in Cedar Rapids yesterday campaigning, 
and he was also very attentive 
to the problems of Cedar Rapids in 
his town meeting. He said he came 
there and wanted to listen. I have not 
heard reports on what questions he received, 
what complaints he received. 
He may have been talking just to a 
friendly audience—I don’t know. But 
he did say that he was there to listen, 
and I hope after he has listened to the 
situation in Cedar Rapids that he will 

tell friends in the Congress of the 
United States that we need to act 
quickly. I hope he would say we should 
have acted this week—which action 
now, of course, is impossible because 
we are breaking for our summer break. 

I am here once again to discuss the 
plight of my fellow Iowans and many 
others throughout the Midwest following 
a series of deadly tornadoes, 
storms, and floods. It is a multiple disaster, 
tornadoes and floods, and not 
just floods. Iowa has 99 counties. Of 
those, 80 counties have been designated 
as a disaster area by FEMA. 

When looking at a map of Iowa, it is 
much easier to count the few counties 
that are not disaster areas than the 
vast majority that are disaster areas. 
Every weekend except for this past 
weekend since we were in session, I 
have been back in Iowa to meet with 
people affected by the storm and to see 
the devastation for myself. As I noted 
last week, estimates of damage are in 
the billions of dollars and are climbing 
every day. 

I thought nothing could match my 
frustration at seeing so many Iowans 
in such great need, but the fact that we 
have not been able to act upon both the 
appropriations bill, as well as this tax 
bill, has frustrated me. It seems because 
we do not see the storm on television 
all the time that there is an apparent 
lack of desire to help the Midwest 
recover from these deadly tornadoes, 
storms, and floods, quite contrary 
to the quick action that Congress took 
after Katrina. 

Before I go further, I want to display 
a few pictures of the flooding. The first 
will show one of many railroad bridges 
that was severely damaged. Businesses 
such as the one in this picture rely on 
this railroad track, this bridge, to receive 
their inputs and move their 
goods. Throughout Iowa there are similar 
bridges that are damaged. Iowa 
railroads play a vital part in moving 
our agricultural products and goods, to 
do it efficiently, and obviously in a 
more energy-efficient way. This infrastructure 
is important for Iowa’s interstate 
commerce and international 
trade. 

I have another picture that shows the 
museum of art at the University of 
Iowa, Iowa City. This is the museum of 
art. I believe I have heard from the university 
officials that this building is 
going to have to be torn down. 

The next picture shows flooding 
along the Iowa River. You can see the 
tops of buildings. These are homes and 
businesses of people who just want 
their lives back. They are not asking 
for anything extraordinary or excessive, 
but they are in need of help to recover 
and rebuild. They are, in a sense, 
asking for the same help that New Orleans 
got after Katrina. 

I would like to use the phrase ‘‘so 
that they can get things back to normal.’’ 
However, it is very difficult to 
use that phrase. It will take years before 
Iowa recovers, and it will not be 
the same, although we will still be a 
very strong State. 

I can share, for example, the story of 
my hometown of New Hartford, a community 
of 670 just west of Waterloo, IA. 
An F5 tornado ripped through this 
area, destroying a whole section of 
town. The floods then came and inundated 
the town. Out of 270 homes in 
New Hartford, IA, 240 had damage or 
were destroyed. Businesses were also 
harshly affected. Many of them are trying 
to decide if they want to stay in 
business or if they can afford to stay in 
business. Several have already decided 
not to reopen. 

The town I lived around all my life as 
a farm boy—and still as a farmer—will 
never be back to normal. It won’t ever 
be the same. I think we will have a 
thriving community but, quite frankly, 
it won’t be the same. 

The next chart shows you a picture of 
downtown Cedar Rapids. I am talking 
about a 500-year flood. The previous 
flood record was about 19 feet. Levees 
could take up to 22 feet. But I think 
this flood got as high as 31 feet and has 
been referred to as a 500-year flood. 

As you look at this picture, think of 
all the homes and businesses that are 
severely damaged and destroyed. 
Downtown Cedar Rapids is not going to 
be the same. Since Cedar Rapids and 
other places in Iowa are not popular as 
vacation spots as are other cities, you 
probably haven’t seen or heard much of 
the devastation except for the week of 
television when it was actually underwater. 
I can assure everyone that the 
people of Iowa and the Midwest deserve 
the same consideration that was given 
to the people of New York after 9/11 
and the people of the gulf coast after 
the hurricanes of 2005. 

Last week I touched on how the response 
to the Midwest disasters has 
been different from the response to 
other disasters. I would like to elaborate 
on that point. These are some of 
the same points I made last night, but 
I only took about 2 minutes to make 
these points. 

On August 29, Hurricane Katrina 
made landfall on the gulf coast, causing 
widespread devastation. The Congress 
was in recess at the time; however, 
the Republican Congress and the 
Senate Finance Committee sprang into 
action immediately at the staff level, 
even before we got back the day after 
Labor Day. We immediately started 
working with the Governors of the affected 
States and set out goals that we 
hoped to accomplish when we finally 
came back into session. 

On September 28, 2005, less than a 
month—— 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The Senator is speaking under a 
10-minute limit. 

Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous 
consent to continue my speech for as 
much time as I might consume. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Is there objection? 

Mr. DURBIN. I would like to respond 
when the Senator is finished. Can he 
give some indication when he might 
finish? 


S7990 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. About 7 or 8 

minutes, I think. 

Mr. DURBIN. I have no objection. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Iowa is recognized. 


Mr. GRASSLEY. On September 28, 
less than a month after Hurricane 
Katrina, I chaired a hearing entitled, 
‘‘Hurricane Katrina: Community Rebuilding 
Needs and Effectiveness of 
Past Proposals.’’ Governor Blanco of 
Louisiana, Governor Barbour of Mississippi, 
and Governor Riley of Alabama 
all participated. 

On October 6, 2005, I chaired another 
hearing titled ‘‘The Future of the Gulf 
Coast Using Tax Policy to Help Rebuild 
Businesses and Communities and Support 
Families.’’ Treasury Secretary 
Snow testified at that hearing. 

Congress also passed tax legislation 
very quickly. The Katrina Emergency 
Relief Act of 2005 was signed by the 
President on September 23, 2005. This 
unoffset package cost more than $6 billion. 
That package was followed up by 
the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005, 
which was signed by President Bush in 
December of 2005. This unoffset package 
was scored to cost around $8.6 billion. 
Neither of these packages were 
subject to a rollcall vote in the Senate, 
but both were passed by unanimous 
consent. 

I want to make it clear that we did 
the right thing by setting aside our 
planned agenda to help the people affected 
by hurricanes as quickly as we 
could. Some of the people still living 
on the gulf coast still need our help, 
and we should be helping them, and 
some of these tax provisions in what 
we call the extenders package continue 
some of that help. Passing these bills 
without offsets was also the right thing 
to do. As any of my staffers can tell 
you, I am very careful with the money. 
However, when people are suffering 
from a massive natural disaster, it is 
no time to be a cheapskate. 

I am also very frustrated by the desire 
of some House Democrats to offset 
this tax relief package for Iowans and 
other Midwesterners because that is a 
double standard. We did not demand 
offsets when we were trying to help 
New Orleans. I am not asking for anything 
more than the same consideration 
that was given to the victims of 
other major disasters. 

I have learned lessons from previous 
tax disaster packages. We learned we 
need to tailor the relief so more is targeted 
specifically for those who suffered 
damages and really need the assistance. 
Therefore, the package I introduced, 
that I tried to get unanimous 
consent on last night, called the Midwestern 
Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008, 
provides targeted assistance to families 
and businesses in 10 States 
throughout the central United States 
to help those who suffered damage 
from these deadly storms and floods, to 
help them rebuild their lives. 

The estimated cost of the bill is less 
than $4 billion. We need to be prudent 

with our Federal money, and as I stated, 
my tax package is targeted to those 
who suffered loss and is a reasonable 
cost to help these victims of the storms 
and floods in the 10 States that were 
affected. From that standpoint, that is 
something we have learned in the last 
3 years from the package that was 
passed after Katrina. 

There were people who took advantage 
of some provisions who were not 
harmed by the natural disaster, so we 
have tailored this bill so that only people 
who were harmed by the flood situation 
are the ones we will help. We had 
Senators HARKIN, BOND, MCCASKILL, 
COLEMAN, KLOBUCHAR, DURBIN, OBAMA, 
ROBERTS, BROWNBACK, LUGAR, and 
BAYH all as original cosponsors of this 
bill. In the House, the Iowa Congressional 
Delegation introduced a companion 
bill, and the list of the original 
cosponsors to this bill shows this is a 
very bipartisan package. We all recognize 
the need for targeted relief for the 
Midwest. The problem seems to be the 
ability to get the bill up in a timely 
fashion like we did in the case of New 
Orleans. I have been hearing that the 
Democratic leadership in the House is 
insisting that the package be offset, 
which is completely different than how 
we responded to disasters in the past 
when we didn’t worry about offsets. 
Normally when we have emergencies, 
they are emergencies; you get the bill 
passed to help the people who need it. 

Just yesterday the Senate voted 
against cloture on an extenders package 
put forward by Senate Democrats. 
It purported to include disaster relief. I 
am taken aback that the Senate Democrats 
would politicize the suffering of 
so many people just to try to get an extenders 
bill passed. The disaster relief 
in that bill was watered down. It provided 
substantially less assistance for 
Iowa and the other States in the central 
portion of the United States. 

The Senator from Illinois is here, and 
I hope he hears that because I want to 
emphasize that that bill is quite a bit 
different and doesn’t do as much good. 
It is not targeted. It is not helping people 
who need to be helped right now. 

Its authors were apparently motivated 
by the twin misconceptions that 
the Midwestern disasters are not as severe 
as they really are and that we 
should undertake generic tax relief at 
the expense of the Midwest. 

When I say the proponents of the 
Democratic extender package think 
the disaster is not as severe as they 
are, I say that noting that their package 
provided less assistance to the Midwest 
than my bipartisan tax-targeted 
disaster tax bill did provide. 

The Democratic disaster package 
also had a higher revenue score than 
my package. I told you we tried to 
scale this back so we did not make the 
same mistakes we did in the case of 
Katrina, where a lot of people who did 
not get hurt by the disaster were able 
to take advantage of it—not our intention. 
But because we probably hastened 
it through to get help to Katrina victims, 
some people took advantage of it. 

We tailored this so only people who 
have a disaster can benefit from it. It 
had a higher revenue score, as I said, 
than the Democratic alternative. They 
included the whole country instead of 
disasters that have not occurred. I am 
not arguing that we should look at putting 
generic assistance into the Tax 
Code to assist States when Federal disasters 
are declared the future. It seems 
to me that is a worthy thing for us to 
be discussing. 

However, I do not think it is right to 
slow down the help for the Midwest because 
you want a broader national policy. 
People in the Midwest and Iowa 
are suffering now and have been for almost 
2 months. They have experienced 
a severe event that was well above the 
500-year flood level. This is an extraordinary 
disaster. We need the help right 
now. 

The proper time to make a thorough 
a review of how we generally respond 
to disasters should not come at the expense 
of a specific massive natural disaster 
that has occurred and the people 
need immediate assistance. The author 
of the disaster package put forward in 
the Democrat’s extender bill may have 
meant well, but I cannot help but feel 
that Iowa and the Midwest would be 
getting the short end of the stick. 

Their disaster package also included 
a provision that only benefitted New 
York, at a cost of more than $1 billion. 
This is the second-largest provision in 
that disaster relief package, when people 
are literally trying to rebuild their 
homes, their businesses, and lives in 
the Midwest. It is simply insulting and 
disgraceful to use the misery of others 
to play politics and gamesmanship at a 
time when we should be able to put politics 
aside, as we did in September 2005, 
to help people going through extraordinarily 
difficult times. 

However, there are apparently some 
who, because we do not see this on television 
or because they have other agendas, 
want to take advantage to get 
more. At the same time, I am trying to 
get help for my constituents. 

The correct question to put is simply: 
How can I help? 

The best course of action would be 
for the House and Senate to pass the 
Midwestern Disaster Tax Relief Act of 
2008 and do it as we did in September 
2005; do it by unanimous consent. 

We can discuss general disaster response 
as well, but right now the people 
of Iowa are suffering and the Midwest 
is suffering as well. We have a 
moral obligation to help them as we 
helped the people and citizens of New 
York after 9/11 and the gulf coast when 
they needed help. 

If anyone honestly believes Iowans do 
not deserve our help, then please come 
down to the floor, state your views, 
talk about it. I will encourage anyone 
who has doubts about the severity of 
this disaster to do like Senator OBAMA 
did yesterday, come to Iowa and I will 
be glad to take you around when you 
can come. 

I am ready to yield the floor, but I 
had previously made a statement that 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7991 

I was going to make a unanimous consent 
request on the immigration bill. I 
am not going to do that. 

I yield the floor. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The assistant majority leader is 
recognized. 

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when 
Senator GRASSLEY comes to the floor 
and speaks of the Midwestern need, he 
speaks of an issue of which I have intimate 
personal knowledge. In 1993, it 
was my district, my congressional district, 
inundated by these floods. 

I spent countless hours and days 
working with the brave volunteers and 
the National Guard and others to try 
to save buildings and homes and farms, 
filling sandbags and doing everything 
we could to fight off the flooding of the 
Illinois River and the Mississippi 
River. 

This flood, which was not supposed to 
occur 15 years later, matched the intensity 
of the 1993 flood, in some places 
it overwhelmed the intensity in others, 
particularly in the State of Iowa. The 
scenes Senator GRASSLEY has depicted 
on the floor and have been described to 
me by Senator HARKIN are absolutely 
heartbreaking. 

Cedar Rapids and so many other communities 
were devastated. I wish to 
make a point for the RECORD. It is this: 
In the 26 years I have served in the 
House and the Senate, I have never— 
repeat never—voted against emergency 
disaster relief for any part of our country. 


I have felt that when that occurs, we 
need to come together as an American 
family and help others, even if it did 
not affect my State of Illinois. Time 
and again, I have voted for that disaster 
relief, believing the day might 
come when I would need it for the people 
I represented. I sincerely believe 
that. I believe that what Senator 
GRASSLEY has offered, in terms of additional 
assistance for Iowa, and perhaps 
even for my State, in the style that 
was offered to Katrina victims may be 
a good idea. I have not had a chance to 
study it. But I am inclined to support 
it. 

I believe it could be a valuable addition 
to the assistance which we provided. 


I wish to make it clear from the outset 
that what I am about to say does 
not reflect the fact that I could end up 
cosponsoring the bill offered by Senator 
GRASSLEY and work and vote for it 
and probably will before it is all over. 

But I cannot understand what happened 
here last night. The Senate adjourned. 
We passed the adjournment 
resolution. Virtually everyone had 
gone. The floor was empty but for Senator 
GRASSLEY, myself and maybe one 
other Member and the Presiding Officer. 


Then, at 10 o’clock at night, Senator 
GRASSLEY came on the floor and made 
a unanimous consent request for this 
assistance for Iowa. Now, he is the 
ranking member of the Senate Finance 
Committee. I do not serve on that com


mittee. What he is asking for would be 
a measure that would be considered by 
his committee. I looked around for 
Senator BAUCUS, the chairman of the 
committee who works with Senator 
GRASSLEY. He had left for the evening, 
as most other Members had. 

To think that at that moment in 
time, with virtually no one in the Senate, 
after the adjournment resolution 
had been passed, when the chairman of 
the Senate Finance Committee was not 
on the floor, the Senator came and 
made his request. 

Now, any Senator can make any request 
at any time. But it was not made 
at a moment in time where one might 
expect success. This is a matter that 
should have been brought up weeks 
ago, weeks ago by the Senator from 
Iowa, and so many others, in the Senate 
Finance Committee, resolved and 
brought to the floor. 

But it was not until the Chamber was 
empty late at night that it was brought 
up. I spoke on behalf of Senator BAUCUS 
and I objected. I did because it concerned 
me that the day before, we had 
a measure on the floor to not only help 
Iowa, which truly needs help, but to 
help Illinois, to help all the States that 
have encountered disasters during the 
course of this last year. 

Senator GRASSLEY’s request relates 
primarily to the Midwestern area, 
which I am part of, and to disasters 
which occurred after May 20. There are 
many States that have faced many disasters 
which would not be helped by 
Senator GRASSLEY’s bill. He made that 
conscious choice. He wanted to help his 
own State and, of course, he would. I 
would want to help my State first too. 

But in the scheme of things, do we 
not owe an obligation to other States 
that have faced disasters to try to 
treat them fairly as well? How can 
some Senators on the Republican side 
come and vote against disaster relief 
on Wednesday or Thursday, and then 
come the next day and say: I want my 
own version of the bill—late at night— 
let’s make sure we get it passed. 

The Senate does not work that way 
and it should not. We should be conscious 
of the disasters across the 
United States and be evenhanded. Now, 
the Senator raised my name in the debate 
this morning, referring to me as 
the majority whip. I had not planned 
on being on the Senate floor. But my 
staff said: The Senator from Iowa is 
making reference to you. I came to the 
floor. I wanted to make sure the 
RECORD is complete and at least reflects 
my own views of what happened 
last night and what should happen 
moving forward. 

The Senator from Iowa said this 
morning, and I wish to quote what he 
said because I think it is very important. 
The Senator from Iowa, in describing 
why he voted against S. 3335, 
which includes the energy tax extenders, 
$8 billion for the highway trust 
fund so 400,000 jobs across America 
would not be lost; money to protect 
families from the alternative minimum 

tax penalties; the Wellstone Mental 
Health Parity Bill; and, disaster assistance 
for the State of Iowa, the Senator 
voted against that. 

This morning here is how he explained 
it: 

We, the minority, want to stay on the No. 
1 problem affecting this country and, that is, 
the high cost of gasoline and the energy crisis 
that is facing the Nation. 

That is how he explained his vote 
against the measure. Yet he comes to 
the floor and asks the Senate to move 
off that energy matter so his bill can 
pass. The Senator cannot have it both 
ways. You cannot have it both ways, 
when we bring a bill to the floor to 
help the State of Iowa and other disaster-
stricken States and you vote 
against it saying, ‘‘I do not want to 
move off the Energy bill,’’ and then, 
while we are still on the Energy bill, 
make a unanimous consent to move off 
it to help your State. 

If we are going to be fair to all the 
States that have faced disasters, then 
we should pass this bill. I am going to 
give you a chance to help Iowa now. 

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 6049 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate consideration 
of Calendar No. 767, H.R. 
6049, the Renewable Energy Job Creation 
Act of 2008, that the amendment 
at the desk, the text of which is S. 3335, 
be considered and agreed to; the bill, as 
amended, be read a third time, passed, 
and the motion to reconsider be laid 
upon the table; that any statements be 
printed in the RECORD. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem


pore. Is there objection? 

Mr. GRASSLEY. I object. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Objection is heard. 

The Senator from Illinois has the 
floor. 

Mr. DURBIN. I yield to Senator 
GRASSLEY for the purpose of his explaining 
his objection so the Senator’s 
objection is in the RECORD. But do I not 
want to surrender the floor. Is that 
possible? 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 


Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yes, I 
will take that opportunity. I hope I get 
to have an opportunity to offer a unanimous 
consent request as well for our 
side of the aisle, if you want to be completely 
fair. In the last few weeks in 
this body, we have not necessarily been 
fair. 

So let me take advantage of the majority 
whip’s invitation to respond. 
First of all, he knows, because he is in 
the leadership, that I gave the majority 
party information, at least 48 hours 
ago, and maybe 72 hours ago, that this 
week I was going to seek a unanimous 
consent request, and all day yesterday 
we were denied that opportunity, even 
at the point before adjournment and 
my speaking to Leader REID about 
when can I do my unanimous consent 
request. 

You know what I was told? After the 
adjournment resolution. So do not say 


S7992 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

I did not make an attempt to do it and 
do not say you did not know about it. 
If you wanted to cooperate with us, we 
could have had that cooperation. But 
there does not seem to be that sort of 
comity in the Senate anymore. 

Another point you made was that I 
had a chance to work for a tax relief 
package for flood victims. The bill you 
voted for and you asked unanimous 
consent on did less for your constituents 
than the legislation we had been 
working on for 2 weeks. 

Then, he brings up the point about 
not working through committee. Well, 
most of the work on this bill has been 
so we can get a consensus package, 
working with even Chairman RANGEL’s 
staff, so it is not only bipartisan but 
bicameral, so we can put together 
something and get it done very quickly 
in the same consensus manner that we 
were able to help the victims of New 
Orleans. 

Then, the other reason: Why would 
the Senator from Illinois cosponsor our 
bill if it was not the right bill for his 
State and for the Midwest and for this 
disaster? 

We have always tried to do things as 
quickly as can be done when people 
hurt. That is why when we got back 
after Katrina—on Tuesday or Wednesday—
we had $10 billion that we were 
going to give to New Orleans. Before 
the end of the week was up, it was $60 
billion, in 2005. 

Now, do you think the committee 
had an opportunity to work its will on 
that? No. They were responding to 
need. Don’t you think your constituents 
hurt across from Burlington? 
They may be still underwater. I do not 
know. A couple weeks ago, they were 
when I was talking on the radio station. 
In Burlington you had constituents 
who still had just the roofs of 
houses showing. Don’t you think they 
need help right now? 

So I think, first of all, procedural-
wise, either the majority whip does not 
know what is going on when I notify 
his cloakroom that I am going to offer 
it or else he does not care or he wants 
to mislead. 

The second thing is, he is not voting 
for the bills and pushing the bills that 
will help his constituents the most, 
and we still do not have the relief. 

So that is my response to the Senator 
from Illinois. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The majority whip. 

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would 
just say to the Senator from Iowa, I 
was not part of his conversation with 
the majority leader as to when he was 
going to offer his unanimous consent 
request. He offered it after the chairman 
of the Finance Committee had left 
and virtually all the members had left. 

Whether he had an opportunity to do 
that before, I do not know. He did not 
make a request of me. I was not aware 
of it. But he certainly met with Senator 
BAUCUS during the course of this 
week and had ample opportunity to 
raise this issue. It is something that 

should have been resolved between the 
two of them before Senator BAUCUS 
left. I think he would understand, as I 
do, that is a problem for Senator BAUCUS 
to be gone and to make a unanimous 
consent request. 

One thing the Senator from Iowa did 
not say was why he objected to this 
bill. Again, he voted against it. Now he 
objected again—this bill that does contain 
assistance for my State and his 
State because of the recent flood disaster. 
The simple reason is, he disagrees 
with many of the other provisions 
of this bill and decided he would 
vote against it. That is his right as a 
Senator. 

I will tell him again, I may find his 
bill that he is offering today to be the 
right bill for my State and for his 
State as well and support him. Even if 
his unanimous consent request prevailed 
today, the House is gone. We 
will be gone in just a matter of hours. 
Nothing is going to happen to his request 
until we return in September. 

Maybe after the August break, and a 
little bit of time and reflection, we can 
come back and find what we need; that 
is, a bipartisan approach to helping a 
lot of innocent victims of this flooding 
in the Midwest and victims of other 
disasters across the United States. 

As much as I feel for my own home 
State and his State of Iowa, there are 
many other disaster victims who need 
a helping hand as well. I think we 
ought to consider all of them when we 
return. 

So at this point, Mr. President, I am 
going to yield the floor and say to the 
Senator from Iowa, we have worked 
closely on things before. But when he 
raised my name on the Senate floor 
this morning, when I was not present, I 
felt I had to come down and explain 
what happened last night and the situation 
we find ourselves in today. 

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2291 

Mr. President, I have one unanimous 
consent request to ask, which I do not 
think has an objection. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of Calendar No. 869, S. 
2291, the Plain Language in Government 
Communications Act; that an 
Akaka substitute amendment, which is 
at the desk, be agreed to, the bill, as 
amended, be read a third time and 
passed, and the motions to reconsider 
be laid upon the table, with no intervening 
action or debate. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Is there objection? 

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
behalf of Senator BENNETT, I object. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Objection is heard. 

The senior Senator from Iowa is recognized. 


UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3322 

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before 
the Senator from Illinois leaves 
the floor, I want to ask unanimous consent 
to bring up a bill to which he is 
probably going to object. But I want 
him to know that people on this side of 
the aisle want to move things along. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Committee on Finance be 
discharged from further consideration 
of S. 3322, and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration. I ask unanimous 
consent that the Grassley amendment 
at the desk be agreed to, the bill, 
as amended, be read a third time and 
passed, the motions to reconsider be 
laid upon the table, and the bill be held 
at the desk pending further House action. 


The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Is there objection? 

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, this is the same 
request that was made last night. 

On behalf of Senator BAUCUS, the 
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, 
I object. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Objection is heard. 

The Senator from Pennsylvania is 
recognized. 

Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, thank 
you very much. 

ENERGY 

Mr. President, I rise this morning to 
talk about an issue we have talked a 
lot about in the Senate for weeks and 
now months, literally, and we have not 
reached a resolution on it. It is the 
question of energy and gasoline and 
what has been happening to our economy, 
what has been happening to our 
families. 

There is plenty of blame to go 
around. I am not here to do that today. 
But I do think that anything we talk 
about—and certainly anything we legislate 
on—has to pass two tests. One 
test is, will it provide short-term relief 
to families or short-term help to the 
economy? And, will it help long term? 
If it does not pass the short-term and/ 
or the long-term test, we should not be 
doing it. That is kind of the frame of 
what I want to use to talk about some 
of the issues I am going to raise this 
morning. 

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield for a unanimous consent 
request? 

Mr. CASEY. Sure. 

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I apologize 
for interrupting the Senator. 

I ask unanimous consent that I be 
recognized following the Senator’s remarks 
for 20 minutes. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem


pore. Is there objection? 

Without objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator from North Dakota for reminding 
me what I promised I would 
do. 

Mr. President, I want to talk about 
this issue in terms of short term and 
long term because one thing that has 
been missing from this debate, frankly, 
on both sides, is sometimes not nearly 
enough honesty—a lot of charges and 
countercharges, a lot of finger pointing, 
and not enough progress. I think 
for one party or the other in the Senate 
to blame the other is not productive, 
nor is it accurate. 

So let’s talk about short term and 
long term. There are some things we 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7993 

can do short term to help this problem. 
No one here has a magic wand to say if 
we take this action, gas prices are 
going to go down in the next couple of 
weeks. Anyone who says that is probably 
not telling the truth—maybe not 
even over the course of a couple of 
months. But there are some things we 
should try to help in the short term before 
we abandon that and say all we 
can do is look to the long term, which 
we all know is renewable energy and 
all of these strategies. But let’s talk 
about the short term. 

I think yesterday a number of Senators—
I think the total is 36; I will 
stand corrected if I am wrong about 
that—at least 35 or 36 Senators wrote 
to the President of the United States. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the July 31 letter to the 
President regarding the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 

U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, July 31, 2008. 

The PRESIDENT, 

The White House, 
Washington, DC. 

DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: We are writing today 
to urge you to use your emergency authority 
to immediately release oil from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve. Virtually no other 
action you could take would have as positive 
or as immediate an impact at the pump, lowering 
fuel prices for American consumers and 
businesses. Unlike other proposals put forward 
in recent days that would take 8 to 10 
years to affect the price of gasoline, an announcement 
of plans to release oil from the 
Reserve could cause a decline in oil prices 
within hours. A similar announcement made 
by your father, President George H. W. Bush, 
in 1991 led oil prices to decline within a day 
of the announcement, even though the actual 
release of oil did not occur for two 
weeks. 

For the past two months, U.S. gasoline 
prices have topped $4.00 per gallon—at least 
$1 more than just a year ago. Diesel fuel has 
been even more expensive, now averaging 
$4.60 a gallon. This has had a devastating effect 
on American families and businesses. 
Although gasoline prices have risen 165 percent 
since you have taken office, average 
gross income has increased only approximately 
24 percent. High transportation costs 
are adding to higher prices in our stores and 
supermarkets, too. 

Fuel prices have risen in direct response to 
rising crude oil prices. The 40-percent increase 
in oil prices since the beginning of the 
year is unprecedented, given that there have 
been no unusual world supply disruptions. 
Instead, growing worldwide demand, flat production, 
and uncontrolled market speculation 
have put upward pressure on oil prices. 
This crisis constitutes a severe energy supply 
interruption. It requires an immediate 
response, and you hold it in your power to 
authorize a release from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve that will immediately supplement 
our crude oil supply and break the 
cycle of spiraling speculation. 

The Government Accountability Office recommended 
in a hearing before the Senate 
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources 
on February 26, 2008, that the Department of 
Energy hold 10 percent of its Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve inventory in heavy crude 
oil. The lack of heavy, sour crude oil in the 

Reserve inventory poses a problem for refiners 
that use this kind of oil, refiners upon 
whom we would rely in the case of an emergency 
supply disruption. The Department 
has acknowledged the benefit of holding 
heavier crude oil in its inventory and stated 
its intent to acquire heavy crude oil as it expands 
its inventory capacity. 

We ask that you take immediate action to 
begin to implement this modernization of 
the Reserve by releasing 70 million barrels of 
light, sweet crude oil, about 10 percent of the 
current Reserve inventory. 

This would have an immediate effect on oil 
and gasoline prices, unlike proposals that 
would open new federal land and offshore 
areas for drilling, which would not add oil to 
the market for many years. 

At an appropriate time in the future, the 
Reserve should be replenished with lower-
grade, heavy crude oil, in accordance with 
the GAO’s recommendation. Market conditions 
are favorable for this exchange of light 
for heavy crude, as the current high price 
differential between these two crude types 
would allow the Department to generate considerable 
revenue. 

Given the benefits this step offers for the 
mission of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
and the relief it would provide to Americans 
suffering from record high fuel costs, we urge 
you to direct the Department of Energy to 
release light, sweet crude oil from the reserve 
to help Americans at the pump now. 

Thank you for your consideration of this 
matter. 
Sincerely, 

Dick Durbin, Harry Reid, Bill Nelson, 

John Kerry, Amy Klobuchar, Kent 

Conrad, Debbie Stabenow, Dianne Fein


stein, Herb Kohl, Barbara Boxer, 

Sherrod Brown, ——— ———. 

Mr. CASEY. I won’t read the whole 
letter, and I won’t read all the signatures. 
But here is how the letter starts. 
The first line of the letter reads: 

Dear Mr. President: 

We are writing today— 

Meaning yesterday— 
to urge you to use your emergency authority 
to immediately release oil from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve. 

It goes on later in that paragraph to 
say: 

A similar announcement made by your father, 
President George H.W. Bush, in 1991 led 
oil prices to decline within a day of the announcement, 
even though the actual release 
of oil did not occur for two weeks. 

So when that happened in 1991, oil 
prices went down very rapidly. The 
same happened with this President 
Bush in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Katrina. So what we ask is that the 
President—he does not need Congress; 
he does not need to get a consensus in 
Washington—the President has the authority 
today to release oil from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 

So the letter, toward the end, says: 

We ask that you take immediate action to 
begin to implement this modernization of 
the Reserve by releasing 70 million barrels of 
light, sweet crude oil, about 10 percent of the 
current Reserve inventory. 

So I am quoting in part from the letter, 
but the point is, the President of 
the United States today—today—has 
all the power and the authority to take 
that action. Will it be a magic wand? 
No. Will it immediately lower prices? 
Probably not. But it has the potential 

because of the precedents of what happened 
before—the recent history on 
this—to bring down prices. So that is 
something that is short term that the 
President could do right now. I hope he 
would do that. 

But let’s talk about long term. One 
thing we all agree upon, both sides of 
the aisle, we can fight and we can point 
fingers and we can have arguments and 
debates—and it is OK to debate—but 
one thing we all agree on, no matter 
what party we are in—and this is something 
the American people understand 
in their gut; they get this and they understand 
this—we have to take steps 
now that we should have taken 10 years 
ago or maybe 20 or 25 years ago that we 
did not take to reduce our dependence 
on foreign oil and to get to this question 
of renewables. 

We had that chance a couple of times 
in the last 18 months. We had that 
chance just a few days ago, but it was 
blocked. A lot of people in this body 
voted for it. We did not get enough 
votes, but here is what was blocked. 

Let me run through a quick list because 
sometimes when these votes 
occur and the vote is announced we forget 
what was voted on. Here is what 
was blocked a couple days ago: a new 
consumer tax credit for the purchase of 
plug-in electric vehicles, to move that 
tax credit from $3,000 to $5,000, plug in 
electric vehicles, that was blocked; a 1-
year extension of a wind power tax 
credit, that was blocked; a 3-year extension 
of biomass, geothermal, and 
other renewable energy tax credits, 
that was blocked; an extension of the 
30-percent investment tax credit for 
solar energy, that was blocked; an extension 
of the 10-percent investment 
tax credit for fuel cells, that was 
blocked; a 5-year extension of the tax 
deduction for energy-efficient commercial 
buildings—we know we have to do 
that—that was blocked; a 3-year extension 
of the tax credit for energy-efficient 
appliances, that was blocked. 

So on issue after issue that gets to 
this question of reducing our dependence 
on foreign oil, getting off of oil 
generally—not just foreign oil but getting 
off of the dependence on oil— 
working on all of those renewable energy 
strategies that everybody in the 
country knows we have to do, they 
were blocked a couple days ago, and we 
should remind people who are paying 
attention to this issue that actually 
happened. 

We have a debate currently about 
speculation. I am not going to spend a 
lot of time on that. It is not a magic 
wand. I have said that before. But it is 
one of the ways—probably more long 
term than short term, but it is one of 
the ways we have to provide some relief 
long term. 

So these are strategies that, whether 
it is speculation, cracking down, and 
providing more sunlight—that is all we 
are asking for, is to say: If you want to 
make a lot of money in the market, 
and we have a commodity futures entity 
that regulates your conduct, we 


S7994 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

want to give them the authority to 
provide sunlight to that transaction. 
That is all we are asking. That is all 
we are asking on speculation. 

So speculation passes maybe both 
but at least one of the short-term/long-
term tests—one of that two-part test. 
This letter to the President on the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve—that certainly 
passes the short-term test that 
we can get some short-term help. It is 
not all the relief we want, not a magic 
wand, but it can provide some help. 

So what else do we need to talk 
about? 

We have been talking and talking a 
lot about drilling. Let’s put some facts 
on the table. Some of these facts have 
not been on the table. It is important 
to do that. I know there are a lot of 
people out there saying: If we could 
just drill, we could have some relief 
provided. I would argue—and I think 
there is a lot of evidence to show this— 
that the drilling argument put forth by 
the other side does not pass the short-
term test and does not pass the long-
term test. It does not pass either test, 
and we know that. 

Here is what should be on the table 
in terms of facts. All these years since 
the President has been in office, the 
price of gasoline has gone up, and in 
my home State of Pennsylvania people 
are paying more in a year—almost 
$2,800 more—for gasoline than they 
were when the administration started. 
OK. That is just a fact. We know the 
price of gasoline has gone up. Everyone 
understands that. 

But while the price of gasoline was 
going up over the last couple years, 
guess what else was going up. This has 
not been talked about much. There has 
been a 361-percent increase in oil drilling. 
So we have increased oil drilling a 
lot. Some might argue we have never 
drilled more. There has been a 361-percent 
increase in oil drilling since the 
President came into office, and yet the 
price of gasoline has gone up at the 
same time. So this idea that oil drilling 
has been restricted or limited is 
contrary to the facts. 

So how can that be? If the other side 
keeps talking about ‘‘drilling leading 
to relief,’’ how can it be that we have 
had that increase, and whether you 
measure it by the increase in drilling 
or the leases, we have had a dramatic 
increase in the number of leases. So 
that is fact No. 1, a 361-percent increase 
in oil drilling since the administration 
started. 

Here is another fact: Seventy-nine 
percent of America’s recoverable oil reserves 
are already open for drilling. 
Seventy-nine percent are open—open 
for business right now. So there is 
plenty of drilling going on; in fact, it 
has accelerated. Yet the price of gasoline 
has gone up. 

Regarding the 24-percent versus 3-
percent argument that I and others 
have made, the Washington Post had a 
chart on Sunday, July 27, page A–8, and 
I have the chart right here, a chart in 
red. It reads very simply: The percent 

of the world’s oil consumed by the 
United States in 2007: 24.4 percent. So 
we are consuming more of the world’s 
oil. It is up to 24 percent. So if you 
want to drill your way to that 24 percent 
of the world’s oil—because that is 
what the other side is saying—then we 
must be, I guess, hoping to produce 
enough to get there. Well, we know 
America has only 3 percent of the 
world’s oil reserves, so no matter what 
we do on drilling, even if we add to the 
massive increase we have had in drilling, 
it is not going to get us to the 24.4 
percent consumption. That is why we 
have to get renewables. 

So when people across America say 
we can’t drill our way out of it, that is 
not just a nice little phrase, it is the 
truth. You can’t get to 24.4 percent if 
you only have 3 percent of the reserves, 
no matter what you do on drilling. 

Finally—and I won’t spend a lot of 
time on this, but it is relevant to the 
discussion—one party involved but 
that hasn’t checked in on the debate to 
give us a little help is the oil companies. 
Members of the House and Senate 
are debating and sometimes fighting, 
the American people are arguing about 
this, and all the while this debate is 
going on, guess who is getting our tax 
money—tens of billions—and guess who 
is also doing pretty well on their quarterly 
profits. Big oil. I have said it before 
and I will say it again. President 
Kennedy was right. Once in a while, we 
have to ask ourselves, what can we do 
for our country? I have to ask Mr. Big 
Oil: What are you doing for your country? 
While we are having this debate 
and while everyone is frustrated by gas 
prices—and rightfully so—what is big 
oil doing? 

Well, here is what they are doing. 
ExxonMobil released their quarterly 
profits: in one quarter, almost $12 billion 
in profits, and we are giving them 
tax breaks. So they get all the drilling 
they need, they are getting our tax 
money, their quarterly profit is $11 billion, 
and they are not checking in. 
They are not saying, you know what— 
or we are not saying to them with legislation—
we want to do it, I want to do 
it, but we don’t have enough votes on 
the other side to do it. We are not saying: 
You know what, Mr. Big, with big 
oil profits, you have enough. You have 
enough tax breaks, you have enough 
places to drill. You have enough profits. 
You have enough. It is time for Mr. 
Big Oil to give a little, to help us a little 
as we debate this, because until 
they check in and until they help the 
American people, or until we force 
them to help the American people, we 
are going to be missing a lot of opportunities. 


I will conclude with this. I think we 
should continue this important debate. 
I am happy the majority leader, who I 
think has shown great leadership on 
this issue, has continued to work in a 
bipartisan way and wants to have a 
summit, a meeting with both parties. 
That is important to get something 
done. I think we can. If we don’t start 

dealing with facts and start dealing 
with that test, what will help us short 
term but, more importantly, what is 
going to help us long term—and that is 
renewables—until we get to the question 
of renewables and until more people 
on the other side start voting to 
incentivize the creation of renewable 
sources of energy, we are not going to 
make much progress. So I think we 
need to focus on that test and we need 
to make sure we are working in a bipartisan 
way to try to bring some relief 
to American families. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The Senator from North Dakota 
is recognized for 20 minutes. 

CHINA 

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come 
today as a United States Senator, but 
also as the co-chairman of the Congressional-
Executive Commission on China. 
I wish to tell my colleagues that the 
Congress created the Congressional-Executive 
Commission on China in the 
year 2000 to monitor China’s compliance 
with international human rights 
standards and to encourage the development 
of the rule of law there. I am 
proud to be a co-chairman of the Congressional 
Executive Commission on 
China. I think the role it performs is 
an extremely important one. 

I come to the Senate floor today in 
that role. I also come as well to say 
that at a time when there is so much 
criticism of almost everybody in the 
political system—and I have done my 
share of differing with various people 
in politics—I come today to say to 
President Bush that I very much appreciate 
the actions he took this week 
when he met with several dissidents 
from China, all of whom have been imprisoned 
in China for exercising the 
fundamental human right of free 
speech. 

The President met with the dissidents 
for the same reason I come to 
the floor of the Senate this morning. 
One week from today, the 2008 Summer 
Olympics begin. It is a great pageantry 
and a great celebration, in many ways. 
It is a celebration of athletic achievement 
from all around the globe. We 
will have many Americans representing 
our country and demonstrating 
their individual achievements 
on the field of sport. We will 
have basketball players and tennis 
players and gymnasts and track and 
field participants. They will participate 
in these wonderful Olympic games 
that occur every 4 years. 

The Olympic games at this time, a 
week from now, will be held in the 
country of China. There was dispute 
about that and concern about China 
hosting the Olympics, but China convinced 
the International Olympic Committee 
that it would make significant 
progress in areas that reflect the ideals 
of the Olympics—especially human 
rights and human dignity. Because of 
the commitments it made, China was 
awarded the Olympic Games for 2008. 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7995 

This is, it seems to me, not only an opportunity 
for athletes from our country 
and around the world to compete in 
sport, but it is also an opportunity, 
given that the Games will be held this 
year in China, for our country and for 
other countries to appeal to the Chinese 
government to open its system to 
greater human rights. It is also an opportunity 
to strongly urge the Chinese 
government at this point to address 
the issue of so many of its citizens— 
many of whom are its best and brightest 
citizens—sitting in dark prison 
cells, having been sent to prison for exercising 
the right of free speech. 

China is an extraordinary country. 
You cannot understand the wonder of 
China without visiting it. You can’t 
help but stand on the Great Wall of 
China and think about the history of 
this incredibly interesting country. 
Visiting China is an extraordinary experience. 
But, it is also the case that 
China is not an open society. 

Our Congressional-Executive Commission 
on China has the largest database 
of prisoners, the most complete 
database of Chinese political prisoners 
that is accessible and searchable by the 
public. Why do we keep that database? 
So we can shine a bright light into the 
darkest cells of China, for those who 
have been imprisoned by the Chinese 
for exercising the right of free assembly 
and free speech, and to say to 
them: The world knows you are there. 
You are not forgotten. 

The international community has 
the opportunity at this moments during 
these Olympics to speak up and 
speak out. I complimented President 
Bush for meeting with the dissidents 
this week. I think it was exactly the 
right thing to do. I compliment him 
and support him for what he said to the 
dissidents. He said to the dissidents 
that he intended to not only care about 
freedom and liberty, but when he traveled 
to China, and to talk to the Chinese 
about freedom and liberty. 

All of the people President Bush met 
with this week have spent years in Chinese 
jails for advocating on behalf of 
religious freedom, human rights, freedom 
of speech in China. So when the 
President travels to China for the 
opening of the Olympics, it is vital, it 
seems to me—and I think I speak for 
the entire Congress—to say it is vital 
that the President express in the 
strongest terms possible to the Chinese 
that they need to address the human 
rights problems in their country that 
have been so deeply disturbing to the 
rest of the world. 

As I indicated, we have the names of 
807 political prisoners known or believed 
to be currently detained, imprisoned 
or under house arrest. These 807 
records of Chinese people in jail are a 
subset of the nearly 4,500 records in the 
Political Prisoner Database. The rest 
of the records reflect release, death, or 
escape. 

Our commission works very hard to 
get information out about those who 
are being held in some of the darkest 

cells in China. We want the world to 
pay attention. The President of the 
United States committing to go to 
China and to talk to the Chinese leaders 
about these people is very important. 
We have sent President Bush the 
list of 807 prisoners now in Chinese 
prisons. Let me go through a few of 
them, because I think it is important 
to attach faces and names to this list 
of 807 people. 

This man is named Hu Jia. Hu Jia is 
a courageous activist who was jailed 
last December by Chinese authorities 
because he was invited to speak at a 
European Parliament hearing. At the 
hearing, he made comments in his testimony 
that were critical of China 
hosting the Olympics. The result was 
that he was put in a Chinese prison. His 
wife and infant daughter—and you see 
his wife and daughter in this photograph—
were placed under house arrest 
for several months. In April, Hu Jia 
was sentenced to 31/2 years in prison for 
inciting subversion of state power. Let 
me describe the charge again: ‘‘Inciting 
subversion of state power.’’ 

I recently talked to a man who testified 
at that same European Parliament 
hearing and along with Mr. Hu Jia. 
This man, however, is not in prison because 
he is not a Chinese citizen. He 
also just expressed himself like Hu Jia. 
At the request of a hearing of the European 
Parliament, he testified and expressed 
himself. He expressed criticism 
of China for being chosen to host the 
Olympics. For that, Mr. Hu Jia will 
spend 31/2 years in a Chinese prison. 

The next photograph is a photograph 
of Yang Chunlin. He has been repeatedly 
detained for helping farmers seek 
compensation for lost land in China. 
Last summer he organized a petition 
entitled ‘‘We Want Human Rights, Not 
The Olympics.’’ He was subsequently 
arrested and he was charged for inciting 
subversion of state power. We are 
told that he has suffered severe beatings, 
causing damage to his eyesight, 
all for the purpose of speaking out, exercising 
the right of free speech. He is 
a very courageous Chinese citizen who 
simply wants the opportunity to speak 
freely. 

Finally, Mr. Ye Guozhu. He is pictured 
in this photograph alone. Three 
generations of his family were evicted 
from their Beijing home in 2003 to 
make way for the Olympic-related construction 
that occurred in Beijing. In 
2004, because three generations of his 
family were evicted from their homes, 
he applied for permission to organize a 
protest against other alleged forced 
evictions in connection with preparations 
for the Olympics. He was arrested. 
He has been sentenced to 4 
years in prison. 

Let me describe the charge. The 
charge for which he is serving 4 years 
in a Chinese prison is ‘‘provoking and 
making trouble.’’ Because three generations 
of his family had been evicted 
from their homes to make room for the 
Olympics, he decided to circulate a petition 
to organize a protest against 

other alleged forced evictions, and he 
is now serving 4 years in prison. We are 
told he has repeatedly been tortured. 
He finished his sentence, by the way, 
and was supposed to be released from 
prison this week. But his release has 
been further delayed, presumably, because 
the Olympics are near. 

The President of the United States— 
and only the President—has the power 
to shine the brightest light in the 
world into the dark cells in China and 
say to these courageous Chinese citizens 
that you are not alone. This country 
knows about you, about your struggle, 
and about your efforts to secure 
freedom of speech and other fundamental 
human rights. 

We have said to the Chinese Government 
we want progress. They made 
representations to the Olympic Committee, 
in exchange for being able to 
host the Olympics, that they would 
make progress on human rights. I have 
shown photographs of some very courageous 
Chinese citizens who now sit in 
Chinese prisons precisely because their 
human rights have been violated. 

Again, I thank President Bush for 
meeting with the dissidents this past 
week. I am someone who, from time to 
time, doesn’t agree with President 
Bush. I am often critical of his work. 
But today I commend him for meeting 
with the dissidents who had previously 
served time in prison in China. He met 
with them at the White House this 
week. It was the right thing to do. He 
made commitments to those dissidents 
that he is going to do all he can. I hope 
he will—when he goes to China—take 
that torch of liberty and freedom to 
President Hu in China and say that our 
country will not ignore these prisoners, 
we will not pretend they don’t exist. 
China has a responsibility to move toward 
greater human rights. 

So this is the moment. I hope very 
much that President Bush will do what 
he told the Chinese dissidents he will. I 
commend him for that, and I hope that 
not just in the next 7 days, when the 
Olympics are prepared to start, but 
also during the Olympics and during 
the President’s visit, he will offer some 
hope and encouragement to those who 
now spend their time in a dark prison 
cell for having the temerity to try to 
speak the truth in China. 

I strongly feel that if we miss this 
moment, we will have missed something 
very important. I support the 
Olympics. They are a wonderful opportunity 
for the world. But I strongly believe 
that when the Olympics are held 
in a country such as China, and the 
Government there makes certain representations 
about human rights not 
only to the Olympic Committee but 
also to those who will attend the Olympics, 
and especially the President of 
the United States, who will meet with 
President Hu, that he will bring that 
message of freedom, liberty, and 
human rights to the Chinese Government 
and describe our expectation and 
the expectation of the international 
community that their citizens be allowed 
full and genuine freedom. 


S7996 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

Mr. President, how much time remains? 


The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The Senator from North Dakota 
has 6 minutes 20 seconds. 

ENERGY 

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish 
to make a couple comments about energy. 
There has been a lot of discussion 
all week—in fact, the last several 
weeks—on energy, and the reason is obvious. 
When you see the runup and doubling 
of price of gas and oil in a year, 
the American people are pretty apoplectic 
about that. They wonder what 
can they do to respond to it. How do I 
afford to fill my gas tank to go to 
work? The airlines wonder: How do we 
afford to put jet fuel in the airplanes 
we fly? The truckers wonder: How do I 
fill the saddle tanks and be able to afford 
it? The farmers wonder: How do I 
fill the fuel tanks for the harvest? This 
is a big hit to the American economy. 

The first step is to do the obvious 
thing. I have a letter, for example, 
from the chief executive officer of an 
oil refining company called Tesoro. 
They don’t produce oil; they have to 
buy oil like everybody else to refine it. 
He believes there is a dramatic amount 
of excess speculation in the oil market. 
We need to wring out the excess speculation 
from the commodity markets. 
Seventy-one percent of what is happening 
in the oil futures market has 
nothing to do with people who want 
oil. They don’t want a can of oil, a 5-
gallon can or even a quart. They want 
to trade paper and make money. That 
market is broken and has been taken 
over by speculators. We should set that 
market right and wring out the excess 
speculation in that market. We have 
testimony before the committee that 
doing that can reduce the price of oil 
and gas by 20 to 40 percent. That is step 

1. We ought to do the easy things, and 
then a lot of other things. 
My colleagues say drill. I say absolutely. 
Conservation is the cheapest 
form of energy. Saving a barrel is the 
same as producing a barrel. We waste a 
lot. Producing and drilling and conservation 
and efficiency. Every light 
switch we turn on, every thermostat, 
everything we do can be much more efficient 
and lose much less energy, no 
question about that. Conservation, efficiency, 
production—and especially a 
game-changing approach away from 
every 15 years shuffling in here like 
bags of wind in blue suits, talking 
about the plan we had 15 years ago and 
15 years before that and 15 years before 
that. 

How about finding new energy and 
moving toward hydrogen fuel cell vehicles? 
Hydrogen is everywhere. Water 
vapor would come out of the tailpipe. 
Wouldn’t that be wonderful? Battery 
storage technology, with substantial 
research, and moving to electric cars. 
How about doing all these things? 
Solar, wind, biomass, geothermal—we 
have so many opportunities. We can 
round up all the money we spend on all 
of it and research a different energy fu


ture, which equals what we spend in 
the war in Iraq in 40 hours. We ought to 
do everything and do it well; but we 
ought to decide that if we are addicted—
and President Bush says we 
are—what do you do with an addict? Do 
you say I will quit tomorrow and pass 
the bottle tonight? That is not what 
you do. You decide you are going to 
have something that is game changing. 
You are going to go to a different kind 
of energy future. 

I wish to make a final point that is 
very important. I support increased 
production, all those things. But my 
colleagues in the Senate have 
blocked—some of them in the minor-
ity—through eight votes, our determination 
to provide tax incentives for 
renewable energy. Renewable energy is 
so important, and we put into place 
permanent, robust tax incentives in 
1916 to say that if you look for oil and 
gas, God bless you, we need it. If you 
find it, you will get tax incentives. We 
have done that for almost a century. 
Do you know what we did for people 
who tried to go find and produce wind, 
solar, and other renewable forms? We 
put into place tax incentives in 1992— 
short term, kind of shallow—and we extended 
them five times, and we let 
them expire three times. Start, stop, 
stutter step. The fact is, we shut off all 
the investment every time they stop. 
They are set to expire at the end of the 
year. The minority has blocked, eight 
times, the extension of the tax incentives 
so we can move toward a different 
energy future. 

If we don’t understand that when 65 
percent of your oil comes from Saudi 
Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, and Venezuela 
and outside our country and that 
makes America vulnerable—if we don’t 
understand that, we ought to go back 
to bed; you don’t need to wake up. It 
has been pretty disconcerting to see 
people thumb their suspenders and 
stick out their stomachs and say we 
need to drill another hole someplace. 
We suck 85 million barrels of oil a day 
out of this planet, and 21 million barrels 
of that are destined for this country. 
We use one-fourth of every drop of 
oil pulled out of this planet every day, 
and almost 65 percent of it comes from 
outside our country. If you don’t understand 
the vulnerability of that, then 
you don’t have the capability to understand 
very much, in my judgment. 

We need a robust, aggressive, new energy 
future. It must include virtually 
everything, but at its root and at its 
foundation, it must have a game-
changing device that says that 10 years 
from now we are going to have a different 
energy mix, a different construct. 


Yesterday, I said John F. Kennedy 
didn’t hang around in the early sixties 
and say: I am thinking of sending a 
person to the Moon or I am going to 
try to send a person to the Moon or I 
hope we can send a person to the Moon. 
That is not what he said. He said that 
by the end of the decade, we are going 
to have a person walking on the Moon. 

How about saying that in this country 
now on energy? 

By the end of the next 10 years, we 
will have substantially changed this 
country’s energy mix, and we are going 
to make the investments necessary to 
do it, so we are not shuffling around 
here 10 years from now with the same 
tired arguments I call ‘‘yesterday forever.’’ 
How about something that does 
advance this country’s long-term interest 
in energy? Let’s do everything we 
can at this point. In the meantime, 
let’s set a goal and meet the goal as a 
country that makes us less dependent 
on foreign oil and move to a different 
kind of energy future. 

I yield the floor. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The senior Senator from Oregon 
is recognized. 

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for up to 
20 minutes. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 


Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am 
heading home for town meetings this 
weekend. There is no question that the 
dominant subject is going to be all the 
economic hurt we are certainly seeing 
in Oregon and across the country. People 
are concerned about their gas bills 
and their food bills and medical bills. 

Yesterday, Senator GRASSLEY and I, 
in an effort to look at a fresh approach 
to holding down gas bills, released 
what we call a discussion draft, in an 
effort to solicit ideas and input from 
people who have expertise on this subject, 
about how we might change the 
tax laws so as to not encourage speculation 
in the oil business. 

The current Tax Code gives speculators 
tax incentives to bid up the price 
of oil. Essentially, the current tax law 
distorts our markets. It favors one set 
of buyers and sellers over another. Senator 
GRASSLEY and I are going to be 
seeking ideas and suggestions over the 
month-long August recess in the hope 
that in the fall, when the Senate reconvenes, 
Democrats and Republicans can 
come together on a bipartisan basis 
and come up with more sensible tax 
policies, so we don’t have a tax system 
that, in effect, creates incentives to 
drive up the price of gasoline. 

We have put out this proposal, and it 
is on my Web site. Again, we call it a 
discussion draft. It is, in fact, just 
that—a way to gather ideas and input 
and make sure people have a chance to 
be heard. 

On another economic hot button 
issue that is burning a hole in the 
pockets of our people, I wish to spend a 
few minutes talking about health care. 
One of the reasons health care is so expensive 
is that we pay for so much inefficiency 
in our health care system. 
This year, we are going to spend about 
$2.3 trillion on American health care. 
Dr. Peter Orszag, the head of the CBO, 
estimates that about $700 billion of 
that $2.3 trillion is essentially spent on 
health care of little or no value. So we 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7997 

have to find ways to root out some of 
this inefficient health care spending if 
we are going to hold the costs down. 

Yesterday, a very remarkable hearing 
was held in the Senate Finance 
Committee on which I serve. Senator 
BAUCUS, chairman of the committee, to 
his credit, made it clear that he is 
going to dig into these big issues. It is 
clear, once again, that the Tax Code, as 
it relates to health care, is clearly 
driving up the cost for American families 
and for our people. In effect, the 
Tax Code encourages inefficient expenditures 
in American health. We 
have writeoffs for employers. We have 
breaks for individuals but they are not 
shared by all. The $250 billion that is 
spent through these tax rules 
disproportionally goes to the most affluent 
in our society, rather than the 
people who need it the most. 

If you live, for example, in a small 
town in Ohio or a small town in Oregon, 
here is the way it works with the 
Tax Code: If you are well-off and you 
have a fancy health care plan, you can 
tuck a whole lot of your compensation 
into that health plan tax-free. So in a 
town in Ohio or Oregon, if you are 
going to buy a pair of designer eyeglasses 
or get a designer smile, you can 
write off the cost of those Cadillac benefits. 
But if you are somebody in a 
small Oregon town or in Ohio who has 
no health care, you don’t get those 
writeoffs. 

It is unfair. It encourages inefficiency 
because the typical worker is in 
the dark about their health care. Even 
if they have a plan, most of the time 
they don’t have the choice. Most individuals 
don’t have a chance to hold 
down their health care costs the way 
we do as Members of Congress. As 
Members of Congress, we get to choose 
between a host of private plans. If you 
are lucky enough to have some employer 
coverage in our country, you 
hardly ever have a choice, No. 1, and, 
No. 2, if your money is being spent inefficiently, 
there isn’t anything you 
can do about it as an individual. In 
fact, most people don’t even realize the 
reason their take-home pay doesn’t go 
up is because all of their potential increase 
in take-home pay when they are 
more productive seems to go to health 
care. In fact, Dr. Orszag of the Congressional 
Budget Office has said there is 
so much inefficiency in the health care 
system that nothing much is going to 
change until people realize they are 
losing out on take-home pay because 
their take-home pay goes to pay for 
their health care. 

What we have said as a group in the 
Senate—eight Democratic Senators 
and eight Republican Senators—is we 
want to change this system that is so 
profoundly unfair to working people 
and also rewards inefficiency. What we 
have proposed in our legislation—the 
Healthy Americans Act—is to take 
away the Federal tax subsidies for the 
Cadillac health care plans and use that 
money instead so every family in 
America can get a progressive deduc


tion of $15,000 annually to buy their 
health care. 

It is our view that this amounts to a 
trifecta. Health care would be fairer 
because we would have taken away 
those Cadillac tax breaks and given 
them to the middle-class folks who are 
having difficulty affording their health 
care. It would be more efficient because 
people would have choices of 
their private health coverage and have 
new incentives to make purchases carefully. 
And there would be a progressive 
way to finance extending coverage for 
more of our people. 

I have watched with great interest 
the effort in Pennsylvania where wonderful 
people, such as Governor Rendell 
and committed State legislators, have 
been trying to expand coverage. One of 
the reasons it is hard to do at the State 
level is there is no progressive way to 
finance some of the extra coverage for 
people who are uninsured or under-
insured. 

We have found that progressive financing 
in the Healthy Americans Act 
because we take away the tax breaks 
for those Cadillac plans used for designer 
eyeglasses or new smiles, or 
whatever, and we move that money to 
hard working families in Oregon and 
Pennsylvania and Ohio for expanded 
coverage. 

Our approach, as was noted by the 
head of the Joint Committee on Taxation, 
would give 80 percent of the 
American people a tax cut. A typical 
family spends about $12,000 buying 
their private health insurance, if they 
can afford it. We would give a tax cut 
to 80 percent of the American people 
with our approach. 

The Senator from Pennsylvania and I 
sat in on a very good meeting yesterday 
describing some of the questions 
that accompany making change on big 
economic issues. People want to know 
how do you make sure it is not so confusing 
and your family doesn’t get lost 
in red tape. For example, in health 
care, people want to know: If I like 
what I have, can I keep it? I like the 
idea of looking at alternatives, but if I 
have a plan and I like it and my employer 
wants to continue to offer it, 
can I do it? 

What we said in the Healthy Americans 
Act, sponsored by 16 of us in the 
Senate, was absolutely. If you want to 
keep what you have and your employer 
wants to keep offering it, so be it. But 
if your employer wants more choices 
and if you as a worker want more 
choices, we also provide that kind of 
opportunity. That is why I have said 
our proposal operates very much like 
what all of us—the Senator from Pennsylvania, 
the Senator from Ohio, and 
myself—have in the Congress. There is 
a period of time when we get to choose 
between the various private insurance 
policies. The insurers cannot cream 
skim. They cannot cherry pick and 
take only healthy people and send everybody 
who has a health problem 
somewhere else. We do that in the 
Healthy Americans Act. With our ap


proach, we can get a lot more for our 
health care dollar. A lot of people in 
this country, say if they work for a 
small employer where they do not have 
much bargaining power or they are out 
on their own, cannot get that today. 

We set this up so it looks, in terms of 
its operations, pretty much like the 
way it works for us as Members of Congress 
in terms of making our private 
choices. There are places you can call 
for help in choosing a plan. And giving 
everyone these kinds of private choices 
injects competition and new opportunities 
to hold down costs into the system. 


The issue we talked about yesterday 
in the Senate Finance Committee, the 
Federal tax rules, I would guess there 
is probably not 1 out of 100 people in 
the United States who knows much 
about this. But this is one of the biggest 
programs run by the Federal Government. 
It comes to about $250 billion 
a year. And to have the money go out 
the door in a way that so wildly favors 
the most fortunate and encourages inefficiency 
at the same time strikes me 
as bizarre. 

Yesterday, under the leadership of 
Chairman BAUCUS and Senator GRASSLEY, 
conversation was started about a 
topic that I think is essential to this 
issue of fixing American health care. If 
we do it right, there is the opportunity 
for expanding coverage in a progressive 
way so that the next time, for example, 
the Pennsylvania legislature wrestles 
with this issue—this issue that Governor 
Rendell and Pennsylvania legislators 
tackled this last year and could 
not pass legislation on—they would be 
able to say some changes were made in 
Federal policy so as to fund in a progressive 
way some of the changes that 
need to be made. 

There is no question this needs to be 
done in a careful and deliberate way. 
We are talking about changing something 
that started in the 1940s. In the 
1940s, it probably made a lot of sense. 
We were not dealing with a global 
economy, and people would go to work 
in Oregon or Pennsylvania at a young 
age and stay put until you gave them a 
gold watch and a retirement dinner. 
The typical worker today changes their 
job 11 times by the time they are in 
their early forties. So they need a portable 
health plan they can take from 
place to place. We have done that in 
the Healthy Americans Act as well. 

Chairman BAUCUS made a very important 
point in terms of making sure 
this is explained to people in a more 
simple and straightforward way than it 
has been in the past, certainly than as 
it was explained in 1993. Then fundamentally 
it has to be a commitment 
the Congress makes to our people to 
say: If you like what you have and employers 
want to keep offering it, they 
can do it. I hope they will. But nearly 
7 percent of the employers have gotten 
out of the health business altogether in 
the last few years and thousands more 
have heaped on the copayments and 
the deductibles in the last few years. 


S7998 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

We need to have more choices, and 16 
Members of the Senate are working toward 
this goal. This is the first time in 
the history of this debate, in 60 years 
of the Senate debating this issue, there 
has ever been a piece of legislation 
where a large number of Democrats 
and Republicans have come together. 
Senator BENNETT in particular, the 
Senator from Utah, a member of the 
Republican leadership, deserves enormous 
credit for his efforts to help find 
common ground. 

Now we have a chance for the debate 
as we go into September, with Chairman 
BAUCUS holding additional hearings 
in September, and all our colleagues 
being home and folks asking: 
What is going to be done about health 
care? We have a chance now to start 
that discussion about what it is going 
to take to fix American health care. 

I submit that when people talk about 
their bills, they are talking about their 
gas bill, they are talking about their 
food bill, they are talking about their 
medical bill, and that medical bill is 
pumped up—that is the only way you 
can characterize it—by $700 billion 
worth of spending that is inefficient 
and is of little or no value. The Federal 
Tax Code, as we heard from three of 
the experts yesterday, props up all that 
inefficiency. So reforming those Federal 
tax rules, as we seek to do in the 
Healthy Americans Act, is a key part 
of the solution. 

I thank Chairman BAUCUS for his 
leadership for being willing to tackle 
an issue that lots of people, frankly, 
have ducked in past years. And I submit 
that finding a bipartisan solution 
to these outdated, unfair tax rules— 
rules that show how broken the health 
care system is—is a key to holding 
down the costs that people are so upset 
about and assure that we attain our 
goal, which is all Americans have high-
quality affordable health care. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
CASEY). The clerk will call the roll. 

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 

Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I have 
been in the House of Representatives 
and the Senate now for about a little 
over 15 years. One thing you can count 
on that I have seen over and over is 
you can always count on Republicans 
to stand up for Big Oil. We can look in 
recent memory. We can look at the Energy 
bill 3 years ago—earlier than that. 
We can look at the plan Vice President 
CHENEY wrote in the White House 
bringing in all the energy executives, 
not bringing in consumer groups, not 
bringing in environmentalists, not 
bringing in small businesses that are 
hit so hard by high energy costs, not 
bringing in truckers, not bringing in 
people who are paying the bills, but 

bringing in the producers, writing an 
energy plan, that legislation then written 
by Big Oil and other big energy 
producers, pushed through a Republican 
House of Representatives 3 years 
ago and a Republican Senate, having 
given the President everything he 
wanted on an energy policy. 

That is obviously the best example of 
how always in my 15 years here I have 
seen Republicans protecting Big Oil. 
Most recently in the last year and a 
half, as the Senator from Pennsylvania 
said so well earlier, we have seen eight 
filibusters blocking any proposals we 
have had on energy—short-term proposals, 
medium-term proposals, long-
term proposals. 

As the Presiding Officer, Senator 
CASEY from Pennsylvania, talked 
about, there is no silver bullet, but 
there are things we can do immediately. 
We can open the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, sell 10 percent of the 
oil from that Reserve, bringing down 
prices pretty quickly. We can go after 
the speculators. I am not sure Senator 
CASEY said this, but the President’s 
Justice Department could go after the 
oil industry for some of the price 
gouging that many of us in this body, 
and probably most of the American 
public—certainly people in Steuben-
ville and Lima and Zanesville, OH— 
think the oil companies are engaged in. 
We can do those things. 

A few minutes ago, when I was the 
Presiding Officer, I heard the minority 
leader say that the Democrats are offering 
legislation claiming it is only 
speculation that is driving up prices. 
We have never done that. We have said: 
Yes, speculation is a big part of it. Senator 
DORGAN said speculation is like a 
washcloth: you wring it out and you 
will get an immediate 20, 30, or 40 percent 
price decrease overall just by 
wringing out the speculation. 

But what the other side never talks 
about is that it is not just that we 
want to deal with speculation and open 
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and 
have the Justice Department go after 
the increasingly, immensely profitable 
oil industry on price gouging, but we 
also have a very specific long-term energy 
plan. 

As Senator DORGAN said, President 
Kennedy didn’t say: Let’s think about 
going to the Moon. He said: We are 
going to put a man on the Moon. It was 
the early 1960s, and he said we could do 
it by the end of the decade. And he did 
it. It happened by July 1969. I was 16 
then. We had just gotten our first color 
television, I remember. My brother had 
convinced my parents that because of 
the Moon landing, we should get a 
color television. My parents didn’t 
really know this wasn’t going to be in 
color, but it was a good move by my 
brother, I must admit. But I remember 
looking up in the sky and not seeing 
anything other than the big white 
Moon, but how exciting it was that we 
could do this. 

The same thing could be true with 
the President on alternative energy. 

That is what the Democratic majority 
has been trying repeatedly to do, to 
take the money President Bush, Vice 
President CHENEY, and the Republican 
majorities in each U.S. House gave to 
big oil in 2005 in the Energy bill and 
put it into alternative energy development. 


Senator WHITEHOUSE, speaking earlier 
this morning, mentioned that for 
every $10,000 in profits Exxon has 
made, only $1 of the $10,000 has gone to 
research and development for alternative 
energy and $3 has gone into advertising 
how green they are and how 
much they are doing on alternative energy. 
Senator CASEY talked about the 
incredible increase in oil drilling in the 
last few years; that the oil companies 
are drilling plenty, but they understand 
how to keep prices up. 

So I am for more drilling, but I am 
not for drilling in the Outer Continental 
Shelf. I am for the oil companies 
drilling on the 68 million acres of 
Federal lands on which they already 
have leases. Let’s do that first, and 
let’s see where we are on that discussion 
of drilling. We can’t drill ourselves 
out of this, it is clear. 

Last point, Mr. President, and then I 
wish to speak for a moment about 
something related to energy; that is, 
throughout my time in the House of 
Representatives and the Senate in the 
last 15 or so years, I have always noticed 
that oil prices go up when one of 
four things happens: Either there is a 
refinery fire or there is a pipeline outage 
or there is a major catastrophe, 
such as Katrina, or there is an international 
incident that disrupts the 
flow of oil to our country. It is either 
a major refinery fire, a major pipeline 
outage, a major disaster such as Hurricane 
Katrina, or a major international 
incident that disrupts the flow of oil to 
our country. 

None of those things has happened in 
the last couple of years. Sure, China 
and India are using more oil, and that 
is a long-term, huge issue in terms of 
the oil crisis, but to see the kinds of oil 
spikes we have seen in the last year 
and to look at what we have seen, 
frankly, in the 8 years of two oilmen in 
the White House—we know that story— 
nothing has happened that should have 
caused oil prices to go up that dramatically. 
If anything, that absolutely 
shows it is all, in large part, about 
speculation, and it is about the price 
gaming of the system that the oil industry 
and Wall Street have done. 

As we talk about energy, we often 
talk about what that means to our Nation’s 
infrastructure. Today marks the 
1-year anniversary of the I–35 bridge 
collapse in Minneapolis. Our freshman 
colleague, Senator KLOBUCHAR, has 
spoken eloquently about that and what 
we need to do about that. It took the 
lives, as we remember, of 13 people and 
injured nearly 100. 

The Minnesota bridge collapse was a 
rude awakening to Americans about 
the current state of our critical infrastructure 
and the importance of improving 
all aspects of bridge safety. 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7999 

Corrosion, for example, which causes 
metal in bridges to rust and ultimately 
weaken, is a significant problem for 
our Nation’s bridges but one that is resolvable 
if addressed by Congress. 

In 1998, there was an amendment to 
ISTEA, the highway bill. Congress 
commissioned a report about the cost 
of corrosion—a report from the Federal 
Highway Administration—and that report 
to Congress, conducted by CC 
Technologies of Dublin, OH, a community 
near Columbus, has estimated 
that corrosion costs the Nation an unbelievable 
3-plus percent of gross domestic 
product annually, or $442 billion 
last year. In my State alone, corrosion 
ultimately cost Ohio taxpayers, in 
damage to bridges and highways and 
other infrastructure, $15.1 billion. For 
bridges alone, this country spent $13 
billion and $500 million in Ohio in 2007. 
In that same report, the FHA estimated 
a third of that cost could be prevented 
through existing corrosion-control 
technologies. 

There are many bills pending before 
this Congress that would lessen or prevent 
future corrosion of our Nation’s 
infrastructure. 

S. 3319 requires that any proposal to 
the Department of Transportation for 
bridge construction or modification or 
renovation include a corrosion mitigation 
and prevention plan. When a State 
highway department submits a proposal 
to the Department of Transportation 
about this, under this legislation—
there is no demand or other mandate—
it must include a corrosion mitigation 
and prevention plan that looks 
at how much money it will cost to do 
the corrosion prevention and mitigation 
and see how much money over the 
next 10, 20, or 30 years the taxpayers 
will save because these bridges will 
last longer and will be safer in the ensuing 
years. This plan would incorporate 
existing technologies to enhance 
the safety of bridges and save 
Ohio and the Nation billions of dollars 
a year at a time when highway funding 
is suffering severely from a dramatic 
rise in construction cost. 
The reason I talked earlier about energy 
and connected it to these highway 
issues and bridge issues and water and 
sewer issues is that the gas tax—which 
certainly funds much of our highway 
and bridge infrastructure, the construction 
and maintenance—the tax 
dollars are not increasing, and it is because 
it is not a percentage of the cost 
of oil, of the cost of gas, it is the cost 
per gallon of gas purchased. So as people 
are using less, revenues are down, 
and obviously construction costs are 
up as asphalt and other oil-based materials 
are included in the construction. 

S. 3316, a separate piece of legislation 
I have introduced, would provide a 50-
percent tax credit to companies for the 
design, materials, and installation of 
corrosion-mitigation technology. The 
tax credits would encourage further 
work in corrosion mitigation, expanding 
beyond bridges to include all kinds 
of infrastructure affected by corrosion, 
including drinking water and sewer 
systems, motor vehicles, pipelines, and 
defense infrastructure. 

I know that the Senator from Pennsylvania, 
when he is in Erie or Sharon, 
close to my State, or when he is in 
eastern or central Pennsylvania, hears 
over and over from mayors, as I do, 
about the problems with infrastructure 
and what that means to the cost of 
people’s water and sewer bills. Mayor 
Coleman of Columbus told me months 
ago what he was facing—more importantly, 
what consumers, what homeowners 
and renters in Columbus are 
facing—with the increased cost of 
water and sewer bills because of demands 
from the Federal Government 
on what we need to do to guarantee 
safe drinking water, demands local 
governments want to meet but at costs 
which they simply can’t bear. So homeowners 
see double-digit increases in the 
cost of their water and sewer. 

I met recently with the mayor of Defiance, 
Mayor Armstrong, in northwest 
Ohio at a roundtable—one of the hundred 
or so roundtables I have conducted 
in most of Ohio’s 88 counties— 
and I talked to him about what these 
costs are meaning to him in terms of 
sewer and water bills for residents of 
Defiance and Defiance County. 

A few months before that, I had a 
roundtable with the mayors of Fremont, 
Paulding, and Perrysburg, again 
in northwestern Ohio. Mayor Overmyer 
of Fremont, Mayor White of Paulding, 
and Mayor Evans of Perrysburg, where 
the meeting was conducted— 
Perrysburg City Hall in Wood County— 
were all telling me about the immense 
costs they were facing and, again, more 
importantly, their constituents were 
facing with the high cost of water and 
sewer. 

Corrosion protection plans of this 
type can make a big difference in relieving 
the cost of all kinds of infrastructure. 
The new I–35 bridge project 
is under heightened scrutiny from everybody—
public officials, the media, 
and obviously Minnesotans who travel 
that bridge regularly to and from 
work. Their new bridge will be 
equipped with the best technology 
available, including built-in sensors to 
measure corrosion. 

With all these bridge projects in 
other places, we should have this level 
of attention and they should be outfitted 
with robust safety technology 
and anticorrosion technology. The 
technology is pretty far down the road. 
We are able to do an awful lot of things 
to arrest and almost stop corrosion and 
the aging of these bridges. Our legislation 
will not just utilize the technology 
that is available now, but it 
will spur on new technologies to arrest 
bridge corrosion. 

Anticorrosion and corrosion-detection 
measures save money and lives. It 
is nothing but shortsighted to bypass 
such measures. For too long, we have 
governed in a way that has sort of gotten 
us through the day, thinking that 
we have to figure out how to get 

through today and not looking ahead. 
Business doesn’t look often enough beyond 
the next quarter, and government 
doesn’t look often enough beyond the 
next election cycle. This is an opportunity 
for the Nation to use its research 
and development talent to address 
the unnecessary and enormously 
costly burden we bear as our infrastructure 
rusts away and needs to be 
replaced. 

We remember the Minnesota bridge 
collapse of 1 year ago. This body can 
honor the memory of those who died 
there and learn our lesson from looking 
ahead and helping local and State governments 
adopt these anticorrosion 
measures. It will ultimately save lives 
and billions of taxpayer dollars. It is 
something we can do, and it is something 
we should begin today. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The assistant legislative clerk proceeded 
to call the roll. 

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to 
take a few minutes, if I may, before we 
conclude business here today, and then 
basically I guess we will be in either 
adjournment or recess until the first 
week in September. I wish to take a 
moment or so and review the events of 
the past number of weeks, culminating 
in the vote a week or so ago on the 
housing legislation. Of course, the Presiding 
Officer played a very important 
and supportive role, and I appreciate 
immensely his participation on the 
Banking Committee and the effort we 
made together to achieve what I think 
is a fairly historic piece of legislation. 

The news from the housing and financial 
markets continues to be grim. Unfortunately, 
the new Case-Schiller 
Index—which most people are familiar 
with and which is used to determine 
the level of home values—Case-Schiller 
data earlier this week shows that home 
prices were down 15.8 Percent from 
May of last year, including a .9-percent, 
1-month drop in the month of 
May alone. The 10-city price index, 
which dates to 1988, dropped 16.9 percent, 
its sharpest decline on record 
since those numbers have been kept 
over the last 20 years. All 20 cities 
measured by the index showed annual 
declines in home values, and 10 cities 
have suffered double-digit percentage 
declines over the last year. 

Job data is not any better, I am sad 
to point out. It shows a loss of 50,000 
jobs. The unemployment rate now is at 

5.7 percent. 
Earlier this week, the President 
signed the Housing and Economic Recovery 
Act. I am grateful to him for 
that signature. He earlier indicated he 
was going to veto the bill but changed 
his mind. I, for one, appreciate that 


S8000 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

change of mind, because I think it is an 
important message to send to markets 
about the importance of this bill. I 
wish to quickly point out that the 
President didn’t like every provision in 
this bill, nor did I necessarily, for that 
matter, but he signed it into law and 
for that we are grateful. 

This legislation is a crucial response 
to the ongoing housing and economic 
crisis. Most of the legislation took effect 
immediately upon it being signed 
into law by the President. Already, the 
new regulator for the housing GSEs is 
on the job. We are not even a week into 
the bill and he is already there, preparing 
to write the numerous new regulations 
required by this law. 

On Tuesday, before the President 
even signed the bill, I met with members 
of the oversight board of the new 
HOPE for Homeowners program: the 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve, 
Chairman Bernanke; the Chairman of 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
Sheila Bair; the Secretary of the 
Treasury, Secretary Paulson; and the 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, 
Secretary Preston. We all met 
in my office as the oversight board. I 
urged them to get to work immediately. 
They assured me they were 
doing that. In fact, the very next day 
they were having the very first meeting 
of the oversight board. I commend 
them for that. Anywhere from 400,000 
to 600,000 families can keep their homes 
if, in fact, that program works as we 
all hope it will. 

Next week, my staff is meeting with 
HUD staff to push them to complete 
the regulations to get out the $3.9 billion 
in Community Development Block 
Grant funds. For Connecticut, as well 
as Pennsylvania and other States, 
these dollars could be very valuable in 
restoring neighborhoods and homes 
that have been foreclosed, getting 
them back on the market and producing 
those tax revenues every community 
needs in order to provide services 
to its people. The law requires 
HUD to have a formula for the distribution 
of this money ready in 60 
days, and I intend to make sure this 
deadline is met, hence the reason for 
the meeting with the HUD staff. 

The Housing and Economic Recovery 
Act has a number of provisions that 
will make a real difference in people’s 
lives, and I want my colleagues to be 
able to explain them to their constituents 
as they travel around their States 
over the next several weeks. First and 
foremost, the bill establishes the HOPE 
for Homeowners Act to help 400,000 
families keep their homes. It does so 
after asking both lenders and borrowers 
to make financial sacrifices, 
and it does so at absolutely no cost to 
taxpayers. This program will become 
effective on October 1. 

In addition to providing a much 
stronger regulator, the bill increases 
the loan limits for Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac to $625,000. These GSEs— 
government-sponsored enterprises— 
along with the Federal Housing Admin


istration, have been about the only 
sources of mortgage credit available to 
most Americans. This will make this 
credit more widely available to more 
families seeking to buy or to refinance 
their homes. 

The bill modernizes and expands the 
Federal Housing Administration programs, 
raising the loan limits from 
$362,000 to $625,000, so that 98 percent of 
the counties in our country and 85 percent 
of the population of our Nation 
will have access to this very critical 
program. FHA has proved its value 
over and over again, particularly in the 
current crisis, as it has continued to be 
a stable source of mortgage credit, 
even while many of the lenders have 
failed. By raising these loan limits, 
that credit line now becomes available, 
as I said, to more than 85 percent of the 
population of our country. 

The bill also includes a permanent, 
affordable housing fund financed by 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This is 
the first time ever in the history of our 
Nation we have established a permanent 
affordable housing program. Ninety 
percent of these dollars will go for 
the construction of rental housing. 
This will take a little time to get in 
place and will not immediately come 
on line as other provisions of the bill 
will, but for the long-term needs of our 
country, including the ability to build 
affordable housing every single year as 
a result of GSE money, is going to provide 
great relief for those who can’t afford 
a home, those who are starting out 
and need to have affordable rental 
housing. 

The bill includes new protections for 
elderly homeowners taking out the 
FHA-insured reverse mortgages so they 
are not deceived into using the proceeds 
from these loans to buy expensive 
and needless insurance products. It 
will require mortgage brokers to be licensed. 
Again, that is a major reform 
in this legislation. 

The bill expands the ability of the 
VA housing programs. It includes a 
number of provisions to help our returning 
veterans coming back from 
Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere to 
save their homes from foreclosure. 
Tragically, you would be amazed at 
how many of our service men and 
women serving in harm’s way are at 
risk of losing their properties while 
they are serving overseas. This bill 
changes that by providing new housing 
benefits to our veterans. 

The legislation includes $3.9 billion, 
as I mentioned, in Community Development 
Block Grant funds. These are 
dollars that go directly back to our 
communities to allow them to rehabilitate 
homes and revitalize neighborhoods 
that have been devastated by the 
foreclosure problem. Remember, 8,000 
to 9,000 people every day end up in foreclosure—
8,000 to 9,000 homes every day. 
Certain neighborhoods in our States 
and in our cities have been literally 
devastated by foreclosures. These dollars 
will help to get those neighborhoods 
back on their feet. 

Finally, the bill includes $150 million 
in counseling money to organizations 
out there trying to bring lenders and 
borrowers together. 

Let me take advantage of this moment 
to urge my colleagues to do what 
I am going to be doing in my own 
State, and that is doing public service 
announcements, asking my media outlets 
on a daily basis to inform people as 
to what they can do. If they are delinquent 
in their mortgages, they may 
very well qualify for this program we 
have passed in the Congress, where 
they can save that house. It is not 
going to be free of charge; they are 
going to have some obligations to 
meet. It is not for everyone. You have 
to be an owner-occupier. It is not for 
speculative investments people have 
made. I urge people to call their banks, 
call one of these nonprofits, call the office 
of your Congressman or Senator, 
and they will tell you how to get in 
touch with them, but don’t allow another 
month or two to go by on a delinquent 
basis. You may end up losing a 
home that you need to have, and it is 
possible to save that property if you 
will step up. 

So I urge my colleagues, if they are 
interested in doing what they can for 
their constituents in the month of August, 
to find the time to talk about 
this program, let your constituents 
know it exists, urge them to step forward, 
urge your lenders to be in touch 
with borrowers to see if we can’t avoid 
the kind of continuing foreclosure 
issues that are going to make our economic 
recovery difficult. 

I will end on this note: The heart of 
our economic problems, whether it is 
the unemployment problems, the staggering 
lack of commercial development 
that is going on, the problem with student 
loans—all of it relates back to the 
foreclosure issue. The sooner we can 
stop this hemorrhaging of foreclosures 
in the country, the quicker we are 
going to get back on our feet economically. 
So this is not just about saving 
homes or keeping people in their 
homes; it is also dealing with the contagion 
effect that has spread over to 
other aspects of our economy. 

I wanted to take advantage of these 
closing moments to talk about the bill, 
to talk about what is in it, and urge 
our colleagues—Democrats, Republicans—
whether you are for the bill or 
against the bill, there is an opportunity 
now to make a difference for the 
people you represent. 

With that, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor and note the absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The assistant legislative clerk proceeded 
to call the roll. 

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

MISSED ENERGY OPPORTUNITIES 

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to put some facts on the 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8001 

table about the high cost of energy. I 
know many of my colleagues have left 
town, but some are still here. And even 
though today is August 1, I doubt that 
it is the last we are going to hear on 
this debate. I expect that we will hear 
about it all during August. 

I come to the floor this afternoon to 
just put a few last remarks into the 
RECORD about what I think this debate 
has been about and what I think it will 
be about when we return. I know some 
of my colleagues have put out statements 
today about what they think we 
should do in moving forward. I think it 
is very important to address the issue 
of the high cost of energy and to put 
forth a realistic plan for our country to 
move forward. 

Many times this week we heard the 
slogan: Find more and use less. It reminds 
me of the slogans we hear on oil 
company commercials who spend hundreds 
of millions of dollars saying 
things such as ‘‘beyond petroleum,’’ 
and ‘‘look at the future we are planning.’’ 
They are spending all of that 
money trying to convince us they have 
a plan, when in reality they are keeping 
us addicted to oil. 

Mr. President, now is not the time to 
worry about big oil. They just posted 
astronomical second quarter profits. 
ExxonMobil alone made about $130 million 
a day—not bad for a hard day’s 
work impacting consumers. In fact, 
since the Bush Administration came 
into office, oil industry profits have totaled 
$641 billion. And as this chart 
shows every year’s profit was greater 
than the last. 

The complexity of this issue is that 
many colleagues really think that 
drilling more is going to solve our nation’s 
energy crisis. But the clear facts 
is it is not going to; drilling more will 
just continue to add to the profits of 
these companies at a time when we 
should be investing in clean energy solutions. 


So now is not the time to give the 
American people the false hope that 
drilling is going to have any effect on 
oil prices or provide any drop of relief 
at the pump. Now is not the time to 
play politics and to try to continue to 
play the blame game. 

Instead now is the time to realize 
that our economy can’t take much 
more of this. We simply have to get off 
of oil. It is time, after 8 years of an administration 
with a dead-end oil policy, 
that we understand the long-term 
cost of our addiction to oil and how it 
is strangling our economy and our vitality. 
Because unless we change 
course, and change course soon, we 
soon will be sending $1 trillion abroad 
to cover our foreign oil addiction. No 
amount of drilling—no amount—in the 
United States will change that fact. 

Just a few years ago I would come to 
the floor and talk about how we were 
50-percent dependent, heading toward 
60-percent dependent on foreign oil. 
Now we are talking about being 70-percent 
dependent and even more unless 
we change course. 

I think it is safe to say that the last 
8 years of this administration has done 
great damage to the continuation of 
our addiction to foreign oil. We have 
tried their approach. It doesn’t work. 
So what we need to do today is move 
ahead. 

We need to admit the United States 
consumes one-quarter of the world’s oil 
but only has less than 2 percent of the 
world’s oil reserves. We will never, ever 
be able to affect the world oil price. 
Even if we drilled in every corner of 
God’s creation in the United States, we 
would not be able to affect the world 
price of oil. 

Americans can do the math. They 
know we need to be aggressively putting 
new policies into place that will 
make us a 21st century leader in new 
energy solutions. That is what we 
should be doing in the Senate as well. 

Unfortunately, it seems as though 
many of my colleagues aren’t doing 
this simple math. Instead, they are 
trying to exploit the current crisis and 
convince us that we should continue 
this oil addiction. That the answer is 
to give big oil one of their top legislative 
priorities—one they have wished 
for for several decades breaking the 
quarter-century-old moratorium on 
drilling off of America’s pristine coast. 

Pro-drilling advocates and certainly 
the President of the United States 
seem perfectly comfortable perpetrating 
what I think is a cruel hoax on 
the American people. They are willing 
to imply, to insinuate, and to outright 
pretend that drilling off our coastlines 
will help provide some relief at the 
pump. They are willing to pretend that 
drilling will somehow lessen our dangerous 
dependence on foreign oil. 

Though my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle do not like to admit 
this, the American people can listen to 
experts at the Department of Energy 
who say: 

Access to the Pacific, Atlantic, and eastern 
Gulf Coast regions would not have a significant 
impact on domestic crude oil and natural 
gas production or prices before 2030. 

We heard that 2030 is the magic year 
by which drilling in the Outer Continental 
Shelf would produce supply. But 
our own Energy Information Administration 
said that access to the Pacific, 
Atlantic, and eastern gulf coast regions 
would not have a significant impact on 
the price before 2030. 

I know we had a lot of discussion 
about the psychological impact, but oil 
industry experts have testified before 
Congress that the notion of more drilling 
would have no psychological effect 
on world oil prices. That is from oil analysts 
who have written books about 
oil and covered it for many years. 

But even in 22 years the offshore 
drilling scheme will not provide consumers 
relief. This is what the Energy 
Information Administration said: 

Because oil prices are determined on the 
international market, any impact on average 
wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant. 


So the notion that somehow our 
drilling is going to help us relieve the 

price when we are such a small player 
on the world market is really a hoax. 
We are not going to be able to have any 
significant impact on the price. 

Even if we drilled in every last corner 
of our great Nation it would not have 
any impact. We will never be able to 
drill our way out of the fact that our 
addiction to oil leaves critical aspects 
of our economy in the hands of OPEC. 

We do not have 22 years to wait. We 
need to be aggressive in getting off oil 
and move ahead. I know many of my 
colleagues really think the drilling 
that has been talked about here will 
provide relief, and they assume that oil 
companies would invest the tens of billions 
of dollars it would take to drill up 
and down our coastlines. I guess we 
should ignore for the moment that 
these same oil companies are not even 
utilizing 83 percent of the leases they 
already have. 

But the truth is that all the drilling 
will do, even post-2030, is lead to 1 percent 
of what the United States needs. 
That is right, if we go ahead and lift 
the moratorium on Outer Continental 
Shelf drilling and that process starts 
and we get to 2030, the United States 
will still need over 22 million barrels of 
oil a day. That is what our growth rate 
is expected to be under the status quo. 
Drilling in the 600-million-acre moratorium 
areas would only meet 1 percent 
of U.S. needs in 2030. All that money, 
all that risk of catastrophic spills, all 
the years of waiting, and that is the 
payoff—1 percent. 

It is not good enough, and the American 
people need and deserve better solutions. 
That is what, when we return, 
we have to focus on. 

There is a way out of this hole. It is 
definitely not drilling deeper, and it is 
time to say enough is enough and that 
we have to change course. My colleagues 
who use a chart that says 
‘‘Find More, Use Less’’ on the other 
side of the aisle have the same empty 
slogan as those oil company ads that 
pretend they are the solution. 

In fact, I think the solution my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle 
ought to consider is: Find more and 
hold up less. They ought to hold up less 
legislation that allows us to move forward 
on a renewable energy strategy. 
Find more renewable energy and 
sources of power and production for the 
United States that can impact the 
price consumers are paying now, can 
impact what they are going to have to 
pay in 2009, and what they can do to 
get us moving off our oil addiction. 

I say hold up less, because if we look 
at what has happened in the last year 
or two, we have had many proposals to 
move ahead off oil and on to clean energy 
sources that would have impacted 
the price at the pump. In fact, what 
this chart shows is the dozen times the 
other side of the aisle held up critical 
clean energy bills. 

Starting in June of 2007, when we had 
a $28 billion clean energy package that 
we tried to pass. This bill would have 
eliminated some of the subsidies that 


S8002 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

oil companies got embedded in the Tax 
Code, because if we are at $126 or $140 a 
barrel of oil, it is pretty hard to argue 
that oil companies still need tax incentives. 


One of the best parts of this legislative 
package created a consumer tax 
credit of up to $7,500 toward the purchase 
of plug-in electric vehicle. That 
was a provision I authored with Senator 
HATCH and Senator OBAMA. I know 
many of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have talked a lot recently 
about the great promise of plug-
in hybrids and electric vehicles as a 
way to get us off our addiction to oil. 

I talked about that 1 percent that 
was going to be supplied by drilling by 
2030. If we invested in plug-in electric 
vehicles over roughly the same period 
of time, using electricity from our grid 
for fuel, we could have a 50-percent reduction 
in the amount of foreign oil we 
would need to import. 

So the Republican plan by 2030 is to 
drill everywhere to reduce foreign oil 
needs by 200,000 barrels of oil per day. 
Our plan, which is investment in clean 
and alternative energy solutions, like 
the plug-in electric vehicles would reduce 
foreign oil imports by 6.5 million 
barrels of oil a day over the same time 
period. 

The difference is unbelievable what 
we could have achieved if the Republicans 
would have stopped holding up 
these policies. 

And my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle are saying: We are not supporting 
plug-in electric vehicles unless 
you give us offshore drilling. They are 
saying we are holding hostage the 
great ideas and promise of the future of 
reducing our oil dependence unless you 
agree to continue the old, insane practices 
of giving incentives to oil companies 
with record profits to continue to 
provide the non-solutions to one of our 
nation’s greatest problems. 

It is time to get the solutions out of 
the hands of the oil companies and into 
the hands of the American public who 
want tools to reduce their oil consumption. 


Literally, my colleagues voted no for 
cars that could get over 100 miles per 
gallon on the equivalent of $1 of gasoline. 
That is right, that is what a plug-
in hybrid will get you. That analysis 
and study is there, that our nation’s 
electricity grid today has enough spare 
capacity to power 70 percent of cars on 
the road today if they were electric hybrids. 
So instead of paying $3.99 for a 
gallon of gas, you would only pay 
about one dollar for the same amount 
of electricity. 

This was just one realistic proposal 
the majority offered to move our nation 
to where we need to go. But every 
time they vote no on one of these proposals, 
we slow up the process. Voting 
no in June of 2007 was holding us up to 
going to that transition. 

So I am glad other people on the 
other side of the aisle realize the promise 
of plug-in electrics, but they are 
not voting to help us break through 

and implement these solutions that 
could help us today and break the 
shackles of big oil. 

As I mentioned, this was a bipartisan 
bill that Senators HATCH, OBAMA, and I 
introduced over a year ago. Our bill 
provides scalable credits that increase 
up to $15,000 for large vehicles. We had 
this big discussion about what cars 
Americans drive, how big, how small, 
safety issues, farm vehicles, big transportation 
vehicles. The great thing 
about plug-in hybrids and battery technology 
moving us forward is we can put 
those in any size vehicle. We are not 
going to be limited to a small car. The 
legislation would also provide assistance 
for automakers and parts manufacturers 
to retool their facilities to 
speed up the transition time. 

So the Hatch-Cantwell-Obama bill 
would have been very progressive in 
getting solutions out into the marketplace 
that could have gotten us toward 
that goal we need to get to quickly. 

Unfortunately, in December of 2007, 
there was another blocked attempt for 
us to change this policy. In December 
of last year, the majority of Senate Republicans 
blocked what would have created 
a renewable electricity standard. 
That is something even President 
Bush, when he was Governor of Texas, 
supported and today Texas is the nation’s 
largest wind energy producer for 
our country. But Republican obstructionism 
cost us over 90,000 megawatts 
of new renewable energy capacity by 
2020. That is the equivalent of 135 new 
coal-fired powerplants. 

If they had not blocked this legislation 
in December of last year, we could 
have been on our way in 2020 to reducing 
the amount of coal-fired power-
plants that we would have had in our 
country and getting on to renewable 
wind energy. The billions of dollars in 
clean energy investment, tens of thousands 
of jobs could be making an incredible 
positive impact, more so than 
any drilling offshore could ever be. 

Then, just a few days later, there was 
another blocked attempt to move toward 
a clean energy transition when 
Republicans blocked a smaller clean 
energy tax incentive package that also 
would have ended subsidies to the big 
oil companies that have made these 
record profits. Even this scaled-back 
approach was too much for big oil, and 
they basically made their voice heard 
on Capitol Hill. Big oil refused to give 
up what was $13 billion in unwarranted 
tax breaks over 10 years, despite hundreds 
of billions in profits over the last 
8 years. 

Mr. President, the American people 
should know that Senators that voted 
against that bill voted against solar 
power, against wind power, against 
making homes and our commercial 
buildings more efficient. Against incentives 
for homeowners to lower their 
home heating and cooling bills and 
against making the electricity grid 
smarter, less prone to blackouts, and 
against plug-in vehicles. 

Last February, there was another 
successful effort to block $6 billion of 

clean energy tax incentives on the 
stimulus bill. This time we gave up and 
said: You know what, forget the oil 
company subsidies, we would like to 
get rid of them, but you don’t want to 
get rid of them, so let’s put this as part 
of the stimulus package and let’s stimulate 
our economy by moving forward. 
The stimulus bill reported by the Finance 
Committee had $6 billion in 
clean energy incentives that would 
have provided a short-term extension 
of expiring tax credits and help us 
stimulate the clean energy economy 
instead of having it bleed a slow death. 

But we failed to pass that legislation. 
It would have helped us with the creation 
of 100,000 green-collar jobs and 
$20 billion in energy investment over 
the next year. If $20 billion was not 
stimulus and 100,000 green energy jobs, 
I don’t know what was. Yet that was 
another big hold on our ability to move 
forward. 

The bottom line is, we cannot keep 
up this slogan of saying: Find more, 
use less. We need to find more clean energy 
and hold up less legislation that 
will let us get there. Quit holding hostage 
clean energy legislation that is 
the truer predictor of domestic energy 
production, of if we are going to continue 
to be hostage to foreign oil, of if 
we are going to make progress of moving 
the United States forward. But 
again our colleagues held us up on 
moving to that legislation. 

In fact, it was interesting that during 
the time of this vote, some of my colleagues 
were actually out campaigning 
at a solar plant. The CEO at the solar 
plant during that debate said: 

The only question before us today is if the 
Senate, which is debating an economic stimulus 
bill at this very moment, understands 
green and can be green. Federal tax credits 
for solar energy are about to expire which 
will send the growing solar energy into a 
tailspin, especially here in California. But 
the Senate can ensure we keep the economic 
engine moving forward and extend the solar 
tax credits as part of the economic stimulus 
bill. 

We know what the result was. We 
didn’t pass that legislation. And the 
blockage continued. 

In June of this year, blocking continued 
on a tri-partisan bill on the Senate 
floor. That is right, a climate change 
bill authored by an Independent, Republican, 
and a Democrat that would 
have had a low carbon fuel standard in 
it that would have saved an estimated 
5 million barrels of oil per day by 2020. 
That is equal to nearly 85 percent of 
our daily oil imports from OPEC. Another 
missed opportunity, because that 
legislation didn’t pass. 

On June 10, we had another opportunity 
to try to pass clean energy legislation 
that would have helped us in 
reducing our critical energy needs. 
There were hundreds of businesses that 
were up here on the Hill asking for us 
to pass this legislation, telling us that 
new job creation and reduction of fuel 
costs depended on it, and yet, again, we 
had a blockage of this legislation. And 
it seemed, in fact, that many people 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8003 

cared more about the hedge fund managers’ 
ability to use offshore accounts 
to avoid paying taxes than they did 
whether we were going to solve this energy 
problem by making an investment 
in new energy. So again we had a 
blocked vote that prohibited us from 
taking action and taking our country 
in a new direction. 

That same day we tried a second vote 
and again were blocked in a comprehensive 
effort to get oil companies 
to either reinvest a portion of their astronomical 
profits into these needed 
areas of infrastructure or pay the tax 
so we could help clean energy solutions. 
And you guessed it, it was also 
blocked and held up. 

About 6 weeks ago, on June 17, there 
was another blocked attempt when we 
tried to come up with a resolution to 
the long overdue extensions of clean 
energy tax incentives. Again, a strict 
party-line discipline maintained a filibuster, 
and companies across America 
started to lose hope that we were going 
to keep this investment cycle. 

The problem is, without the tax incentives 
every year, where we have 
failed to produce a coherent policy on 
clean energy, we have seen astronomical 
drops in investment. As this chart 
of wind energy investment shows there 
was a 73-percent drop in 2001 to 2002, 
and a 77-percent drop from 2003 to 2004, 
the two times Congress allowed the 
Production Tax Credit to expire. And 
this is where we have gotten in 2007— 
this level of investment in wind energy 
resources. Yet now it is collapsing 
right in front of us because certain 
Senators would not pass legislation to 
make continued investments and continued 
predictable policy that the 
clean energy industry can use to put up 
new power plants. 

In fact, around this time I got a letter 
from a company that I think illustrates 
the mistake we made. It came 
from a solar company named Abengoa 
and the Arizona Public Service, a local 
utility company. They told me that the 
Senate’s failure to pass clean energy 
tax incentives was going to lead to the 
cancellation of a 280-megawatt concentrating 
solar plant near Phoenix. That 
is a $1 billion investment down the 
drain, and 2,000 construction jobs that 
will not happen, as well as 80 full-time 
jobs lost that would have run the plant. 

So we tried many times, but they 
continued blocking these critical bills. 
The filibustering just this week just 
further illustrates this issue. 

It is frustrating because we have 
even heard from those who have been 
in the oil industry such as T. Boone 
Pickens and others who say that unless 
we aggressively act to reduce our dependence 
on oil and get off of foreign 
petroleum, we could see, as Mr. Pick-
ens told us at one of our Senate hearings 
last week, $300-a-barrel oil. 

I don’t think any of my colleagues 
want to see that. So I hope my colleagues 
go home and understand that 
our future lies in providing opportunities 
to find more renewable production, 

not drilling hoaxes. I hope they will 
quit holding clean energy hostage for 
the oil company executives; quit holding 
up the good legislation that could 
move our country forward. 

I hope my colleagues will come back 
to the Senate in September with the 
notion in mind that reducing by 50 percent 
our dependence on foreign oil by 
accelerating the transition to plug-in 
electric vehicles should be our goal. 
That they will realize that holding up 
good legislation hostage for the 1 percent—
the 1 percent—we might get from 
our Outer Continental Shelf drilling is 
risking our country’s future. 

This is the time to make the transition, 
and I hope my colleagues will 
hear that and understand it is not time 
to keep perpetrating hoaxes backed by 
and focused on by the oil companies. 
Rather its time to stop the politics and 
get serious about implementing a plan 
that gets our country off our dependence 
on oil. So I hope when we get back 
in September the other side of the aisle 
will quit holding up these critical clean 
energy bills and work with us to move 
forward on a desperately needed new 
energy strategy for the United States 
that will provide real price relief for 
Americans. 

I thank the Presiding Officer, and I 
yield the floor.

SSI EXTENSION FOR ELDERLY 

AND DISABLED REFUGEES ACT 

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Committee 
on Finance be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 2608 and 
the Senate proceed to its immediate 
consideration. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. The clerk 
will report the bill by title. 

The assistant legislative clerk read 
as follows: 

A bill (H.R. 2608) to amend section 402 of 
the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity 
Reconciliation Act of 1996 to provide, 
in fiscal years 2008 through 2010, extensions 
of supplemental security income for refugees, 
asylees, and certain other humanitarian 
immigrants, and to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code to collect unemployment 
compensation debts resulting from fraud. 

There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 

Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to 
extend my appreciation that the Senate 
will pass the ‘‘SSI Extension for Elderly 
and Disabled Refugees Act.’’ I 
thank Chairman BAUCUS and Senator 
GRASSLEY for their help in moving this 
important legislation to the President. 
This is a bill that I introduced in the 
Senate with Senator KOHL and it will 
make a significant impact in helping 
our most vulnerable asylees and refugees. 
I also want to thank Senator 
SPECTER for his tremendous support of 
this bill and help in negotiating a final 
package. The passage of this bill sends 
a message that we have not and will 
not turn our back on those whom we 
have welcomed to our country. 

As many of you may know, Congress 
modified the Supplemental Security 


S8004 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

Income—SSI—program to include a 7-
year time limit on the receipt of benefits 
for refugees and asylees. To allow 
adequate time for asylees and refugees 
to become naturalized citizens, Congress 
provided the 7-year time limit before 
the expiration of SSI benefits. Unfortunately, 
the naturalization process 
often takes longer than 7 years. Applicants 
are required to live in the United 
States for a minimum of 5 years prior 
to applying for citizenship. In addition 
to that time period, their application 
process often can take 3 or more years 
before there is resolution. 

Because of this time delay, many individuals 
are trapped in the system and 
faced with the loss of their SSI benefits. 
In fact, by the end of 2008 more 
than 30,000 elderly and disabled refugees 
will have lost their benefits and 
more than 19,000 are projected to lose 
their benefits in the coming years. 

Many of these individuals are elderly 
refugees who fled persecution or torture 
in their home countries. They include 
Jewish refugees fleeing religious 
persecution in the former Soviet 
Union, Iraqi Kurds fleeing the Saddam 
Hussein regime, Cubans and Hmong 
people from the highlands of Laos who 
served on the side of the United States 
military during the Vietnam War. 
They are elderly and unable to work, 
and have become reliant on their SSI 
benefits as their primary income. To 
penalize them because of delays encountered 
through the bureaucratic 
process seems unjust and inappropriate. 


The administration, in its fiscal year 
2009 budget, acknowledged the necessity 
of correcting this problem by dedicating 
funding to extend refugee eligibility 
for SSI beyond the 7-year limit. 
This legislation builds upon those efforts 
by allowing an additional 2 years 
of benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, 
asylees, and other qualified humanitarian 
immigrants, including 
those whose benefits have expired in 
the recent past. 

The Senate version requires that eligible 
individuals demonstrate that 
they are moving toward citizenship in 
order to gain the additional 2-year extension 
of benefits. While the Act provides 
flexibility to the Social Security 
Administration—SSA—and the Department 
of Homeland Security—DHS—in 
developing a procedure whereby they 
can verify an applicant’s eligibility for 
the extension of benefits, it is our intent 
that whatever procedure SSA and 
DHS establish, it does not impose any 
undue burdens or barriers on the benefactors 
of this Act. 

Additionally, the bill allows benefits 
to be extended for a third year for 
those refugees who are awaiting a decision 
on a pending naturalization application. 
These policies are limited to 
2011 and are completely offset in cost 
by a provision that will allow the Department 
of Labor to recapture federal 
funds that are the result of unemployment 
insurance fraud. 

I again thank my colleagues for their 
support of this bill and for its passage. 

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Smith 
substitute at the desk be agreed to, the 
bill as amended be read a third time 
and passed, the title amendment be 
agreed to, the motion to reconsider be 
laid on the table, and any statements 
be printed in the RECORD. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

The amendment (No. 5260) was agreed 
to. 

(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 

The amendment was ordered to be 
engrossed and the bill read a third 
time. 

The bill (H.R. 2608), as amended, was 
read the third time and passed. 

The amendment (No. 5261) was agreed 
to, as follows: 

Amend the title so as to read; ‘‘An Act to 
amend section 402 of the Personal Responsibility 
and Work Opportunity Reconciliation 
Act of 1996 to provide, in fiscal years 2009 and 
2011, extensions of supplemental security income 
for refugees, asylees, and certain other

HUBBARD ACT 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consideration 
of H.R. 6580, which was received 
from the House. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The assistant legislative clerk read 
as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 6580) to ensure the fair treatment 
of a member of the Armed Forces who 
is discharged from the Armed Forces, at the 
request of the member, pursuant to the Department 
of Defense policy permitting the 
early discharge of a member who is the only 
surviving child in a family in which the father 
or mother, or one or more siblings, 
served in the Armed Forces and, because of 
hazards incident to such service, was killed, 
died as a result of wounds, accident, or disease, 
is in a captured or missing in action 
status, or is permanently disabled, to amend 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal 
the dollar limitation on contributions to funeral 
trusts, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise 
in support of the Hubbard Act. 
This important legislation helps our 
service men and women in uniform who 
are the ‘‘sole survivor’’—only surviving 
child in a family in which one of their 
family members has died or been killed 
due to their military service. Under the 
current ‘‘sole survivor’’ policy of the 
Armed Forces, there are no standard 
benefits available to those who separate 
from the Armed Forces under this 
policy. 
The legislation corrects a flaw, allowing 
sole survivors to qualify for a 
standard set of Federal benefits that 
are generally available to other veterans. 
I would like to comment on the bill’s 
other provision. Section 9 would repeal 
the dollar limitations on contributions 
to funeral trusts. In the Senate, this 
provision was authored by the Senator 
from Utah, Mr. HATCH. It has been included 
to offset the additional spending 
associated with the bill’s sole survivor 
provisions. 
As I have consistently said in the 
past, the Senate Finance Committee is 
not a piggy bank for the other committees 
to dip into to pay for their new 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8005 

spending proposals. My preference 
would have been to have the sole survivor 
provisions in this legislation 
funded by spending reductions by the 
committees of jurisdiction. 

I have been told that option was not 
available for this bill. 

The funeral trust provision under 
Section 9, is a taxpayer favorable provision. 
It is a purely voluntary provision. 
It helps people who want to put 
more money aside in trust to provide 
for their funeral. 

Unlike prior revenue raisers proposed 
by the majority that would impose tax 
increases on unsuspecting Americans, 
this revenue offset is strongly supported 
by those who would pay the additional 
tax. 

As I said previously, my strong preference 
would be to not use the tax code 
to pay for higher spending. However, 
there is strong support for the funeral 
trust provision and it is favorable to 
taxpayers. 

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
read a third time and passed, the motion 
to reconsider be laid upon the 
table, and any statements be printed in 
the RECORD. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

The bill (H.R. 6580) was ordered to be

There being no objection, the Senate

GREAT LAKES INTERSTATE 
COMPACT 

Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous 
consent the Judiciary Committee be 
discharged from further consideration 
of S.J. Res. 45 and the Senate proceed 
to its immediate consideration. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

The clerk will report the joint resolution 
by title. 

The assistant clerk read as follows: 

A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 45) expressing 
the consent and approval of Congress to an 
interstate compact regarding water resources 
in the Great Lakes St. Lawrence 
River Basin. 

There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the joint resolution. 


Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I wanted to 
talk to today about the Great Lakes-
St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources 
Compact. The compact enjoys 
broad bipartisan support, including all 
8 Great Lakes States, Canadian provinces 
Ontario and Quebec, and 150 business 
and environmental groups. 

The Great Lakes are one of America’s 
national treasures and one of the 
natural wonders of the world. Holding 
20 percent of the worlds freshwater, the 
Great Lakes play a vital role in the 
daily lives of the people of Wisconsin 
providing drinking water, jobs, energy, 
shipping, and recreation. Something 
that important to our prosperity needs 
to be conserved so that future generations 
can benefit. 

The compact before us does just that. 
It is a binding agreement among the 
Great Lakes States to implement a 
conservation standard for regulating 
water withdrawals from the Great 
Lakes Basin. Specifically, the compact 
protects the Great Lakes by banning 
new or increased diversions outside of 
the Great Lakes basin. The compact 
also requires each State to implement 
water conservation measures, which 
will promote efficient water use and 
minimize waste. 

Not too long ago we faced the specter 
of foreign companies exporting water 
out of the lakes—threatening our environment. 
This compact is a response to 
those threats, making it clear that the 
Lakes are not to be exploited. As a cosponsor 
of this resolution, I am pleased 
the Senate passed this important compact. 


Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I 
rise to today in support of S.J. Res. 45, 
the Great Lakes—St. Lawrence River 
Basin Water Resources Compact. During 
the course of adoption of the Compact 
by the respective State legislatures, 
an issue arose concerning the intent 
and interpretation of section 4.11.2 
of the Compact’s Decision-Making 
Standard relating to the scale and 
scope of impacts that would be deemed 
sufficiently significant such to preclude 
approval of a withdrawal proposal. 
It is my understanding that the 
intent of the drafters of the Compact is 
expressed in a memorandum prepared 
by Dr. Sam Speck, Chair of the Council 
of Great Lakes Governors Annex 2001 
Working Group, dated December 5, 
2005, and I ask unanimous consent it be 
printed in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 

DECEMBER 5, 2005. 
To: George Kuper, President and CEO, Council 
of Great Lakes Industries. 
From: Sam Speck, Director, Ohio Department 
of Natural Resources, Chair, Great 
Lakes Governors’ and Premiers’ Water Management 
Working Group. 

You and other stakeholder representatives 
have raised concerns regarding three specific 
sections of the November 10 drafts of the 
Great Lakes—St. Lawrence River Basin 
Water Resources Compact (Compact). On behalf 
of the Working Group, I would like to 
provide you with a description of our intent 
with respect to these sections. Please share 
this memo with other interested parties. 

CONCERNS AND RESPONSES 
Please note that all Section references 
below are to the November 10 drafts of the 
compact and ‘‘your submission’’ mean the 
joint submission from the Council of Great 
Lakes Industries and the National Wildlife 
Federation dated October 9, 2005. Each ‘‘concern’’ 
below is the text that you submitted 
to us and the ‘‘response’’ is on behalf of the 
Working Group. 

1. CONCERN: The ‘‘grandfathering’’ of existing 
users. 
The ‘‘grandfathering’’ issue has been 
known—and industry widely believes agreed 
to—since the beginning of the deliberations. 
But, there are major problems with current 
language: 

(a.) The current baseline from which 
‘‘new’’ or ‘‘increased’’ will be determined is 
unnecessarily unclear/imprecise and potentially 
constraining (Section 4.12.2 ii). An industrial 
capital investment made in any part 
of a facility’s water withdrawal system must 
be permitted to operate at the capacity for 
which it was designed and built, no matter if 
other parts of the water treatment or distribution 
system may require enlargement. 
Above all, this section will generate wide 
dissatisfaction and a decided lack of support 
if it is not clarified. 

(b.) There is no provision for challenging/ 
correcting the list of existing withdrawers— 
and the grandfathered withdrawal quantities—
that will be created by each Party 

which may omit users or cite incorrect quantities. 
Some will believe that if they are inadvertently 
left off such a list they will not 
be considered for an existing use at some 
point in the future. 

Response 

(a.) In your submission to the Working 
Group, you proposed that existing Withdrawals 
would be determined as follows: 

‘‘The existing Withdrawal will be determined 
by the [larger] of either the applicable 
Withdrawal limitation in any permit authorizing 
the Withdrawal; or, the physical capacity 
of the withdrawal system facility (which 
includes Withdrawal capacity, treatment capacity, 
and other capacity limiting factors) 
as of the effective date of the Compact.’’ 

The Working Group’s intent and effect of 
Section 4.12.2 of the Compact is consistent 
with your submission. Each State will have 
the flexibility of choosing either to use the 
permitted amount or capacity limiting factors 
for determining existing withdrawals. 

We encourage interested stakeholders to 
work with the individual States to help them 
determine which approach to use when identifying 
existing water withdrawals. 

(b.) The individual States will have the authority 
to create the process for developing 
and maintaining lists of existing water withdrawals. 
It is our understanding that States 
intend to use processes similar to those that 
have been used for other management and 
regulatory initiatives with opportunities for 
public participation, appeals and due process. 
All interested stakeholders are encouraged 
to work with the individual States as 
they develop these processes to ensure that 
the lists are accurate. 

2. CONCERN: Change to a mandatory requirement 
not understood. 
A very recent change to a decision-making 
standard (Section 4.11.2)—a substitution of 
‘‘and’’ instead of ‘‘of’’ as the conjunctive in 
the last phrase—changes the entire meaning 
of the provision and sets up a situation 
where a significant impact on a few feet of a 
stream could be viewed as a bar to permitting. 
Hopefully this is just a ‘‘typo.’’ If not, 
this constitutes a considerable and 
unsupportable change in intent of the section. 


Response 

The Working Group’s intent is consistent 
with your submission regarding the scope of 
evaluating ‘‘no significant adverse impacts.’’ 
To clarify, a ‘‘Source Watershed’’ is the watershed 
of a Great Lake or the St. Lawrence 
River. Therefore, requiring that there be no 
significant adverse impacts to a Source Watershed 
means that, for example, there be no 
significant adverse impacts to the Lake 
Michigan watershed. 

In your submission to the Working Group, 
your proposed criterion included in your Section 
4.9.2 read as follows: 

‘‘The Consumptive Use [or] Withdrawal 
. . . will be implemented so as to ensure that 
the Proposal. . . .will result in no significant 
individual or cumulative adverse impacts to 
the quantity or quality of the Waters and 
Water Dependent Natural Resources of the applicable 
Source Watershed.’’ [Emphasis added.] 

With this language and the corresponding 
definitions, your submission would require 
that there be no significant individual or cumulative 
adverse impacts at both the Basin-
wide and Source Watershed (e.g. Lake Michigan 
watershed) scale. 

In the Compact, the definition of ‘‘Water 
and Water Dependent Natural Resources’’ 
(Section 1.2) reads as follows: 

‘‘Water Dependent Natural Resources 
means the interacting components of land, 
Water and living organisms affected by the 
Waters of the Basin.’’ [Emphasis added.] 

And the definition ‘‘Waters of the Basin’’ 
reads in the Compact as follows (Section 1.2): 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8007 

‘‘Waters of the Basin or Basin Water means 
the Great Lakes and all streams, rivers, 
lakes, connecting channels and other bodies 
of water, including tributary groundwater, 
within the Basin.’’ [Emphasis added.] 

Accordingly, when a reference is made to 
the ‘‘Water Dependent Natural Resources,’’ a 
reference is effectively made to all of the 
water of the Great Lakes Basin. Therefore, 
in Section 4.11.2 of the Compact, the use of 
the word ‘‘and’’ in place of ‘‘of’’ simply clarifies 
that, in addition to your explicit requirement 
that there be no significant adverse 
impacts to the Water Dependent Natural 
Resources of the Source Watershed, 
there be no significant adverse impacts to 
the Great Lakes—St. Lawrence River Basin 
as a whole. 

In conclusion, the intent and effect of the 
language included by the Working Group is 
consistent with the intent and effect of the 
language provided in your submission. 

3. CONCERN: Inappropriate unilateral 
Council authority. 
As currently drafted, it appears that the 
Council can revise all the carefully crafted 
provisions of this Compact (Section 3.1, 2nd 
Para.) without any public or State legislative 
review. This threatens the stability of 
secure access which is so critical to industry. 
The odds are legislators would not appreciate 
this delegation of legislative authority 
either. At best there are significant differences 
of opinion as to how this section 
reads. At worse, the Council has reserved the 
right to change, by unanimous vote and 
without affirmative legislative action of the 
Parties, the Standard. We suspect it is a lack 
of clarity and can easily be remedied. 

Response 

This is an incorrect interpretation of the 
referenced paragraph. The second paragraph 
of Section 3.1 of the Compact does not allow 
the Compact Council to ‘‘unilaterally’’ revise 
the Standard of Review and Decision 
without any public or State legislative review. 
The second paragraph of Section 3.1 
states that: 

The Council may revise the Standard of 
Review and Decision, after consultation with 
the Provinces and upon (1) unanimous vote 
of all Council members, (2) by regulation 
duly adopted in accordance with Section 3.3 
of this Compact and (3) in accordance with 
each Party’s respective statutory authorities 
and applicable procedures. [Italicized numbers 
added] 

Therefore, before any revision can be made 
to the Standard of Review and Decision, ALL 
of the following steps must take place: 

(1) Unanimous vote of all Council members. 
The Council consists of all eight Great 
Lakes Governors (see Section 2.2). Therefore, 
all eight Governors must approve any proposed 
revision to the Standard of Review and 
Decision. Any single Governor may veto a 
proposed revision to the Standard of Review 
and Decision. 
(2) Regulation duly adopted in accordance 
with Section 3.3 of this Compact. Section 
3.3.1 states in part that: Any rule or regulation 
of the Council . . . shall be adopted only 
after public notice and hearing. [Emphasis 
added] A contention that changes can be 
made without public notice and hearing is 
incorrect. 
(3) In accordance with each Party’s respective 
statutory authorities and applicable 
procedures. Any proposed revision must be 
done in accordance with the appropriate 
statutes, rules and regulations in each and 
every State. Each State will have the opportunity 
to determine what the appropriate 
rules may be. 
It is difficult to envision a case where 
there would be no public hearings or input in 
any of the States on a proposed revision to 
the Standard of Review and Decision. All of 

the States currently have in place procedures 
that must be followed before regulations 
can come into force. In some instances, 
these procedures include legislative review 
of the proposed regulations. 

Therefore, an interpretation that there 
could be a ‘‘unilateral’’ revision to the 
Standard or Review and Decision is erroneous. 
Each State legislature has significant 
ability to decide under what circumstances 
the Standard of Review and Decision may be 
revised because of the requirement that the 
revision be adopted in accordance with each 
Party’s respective statutory authorities and 
applicable procedures. 

CONCLUSION 

We appreciate your concerns and we hope 
that this clarification regarding the Working 
Group’s intent is helpful. As always, if there 
are questions please do not hesitate to contact 
me or other Working Group members. 
We appreciate your continued partnership in 
our shared efforts to protect the Great 
Lakes—St. Lawrence River Basin.

controversies; 

‘‘c. To provide for cooperative planning 
and action by the Parties with respect to 
such Water resources; 

‘‘d. To facilitate consistent approaches to 
Water management across the Basin while 
retaining State management authority over 
Water management decisions within the 
Basin; 

‘‘e. To facilitate the exchange of data, 
strengthen the scientific information base 
upon which decisions are made and engage in 
consultation on the potential effects of proposed 
Withdrawals and losses on the Waters 
and Water Dependent Natural Resources of 
the Basin; 

‘‘f. To prevent significant adverse impacts 
of Withdrawals and losses on the Basin’s ecosystems 
and watersheds; 

‘‘g. To promote interstate and State-Provincial 
comity; and, 

‘‘h. To promote an Adaptive Management 
approach to the conservation and management 
of Basin Water resources, which recognizes, 
considers and provides adjustments for 
the uncertainties in, and evolution of, scientific 
knowledge concerning the Basin’s 
Waters and Water Dependent Natural Resources. 
‘‘Section 1.4. Science. 

‘‘1. The Parties commit to provide leadership

‘‘2. The strategy shall guide the collection 
and application of scientific information to 
support: 

‘‘a. An improved understanding of the individual 
and Cumulative Impacts of Withdrawals 
from various locations and Water 
sources on the Basin Ecosystem and to develop 
a mechanism by which impacts of 
Withdrawals may be assessed; 

‘‘b. The periodic assessment of Cumulative 
Impacts of Withdrawals, Diversions and Consumptive 
Uses on a Great Lake and St. Lawrence 
River watershed basis; 

‘‘c. Improved scientific understanding of 
the Waters of the Basin; 

‘‘d. Improved understanding of the role of 
groundwater in Basin Water resources management; 
and,

more restrictive Measures. 

‘‘2. Baseline. 

‘‘a. To establish a baseline for determining 
a New or Increased Diversion, Consumptive 
Use or Withdrawal, each Party shall develop 
either or both of the following lists for their 
jurisdiction: 

‘‘i. A list of existing Withdrawal approvals 
as of the effective date of the Compact; 

‘‘ii. A list of the capacity of existing systems 
as of the effective date of this Compact. 
The capacity of the existing systems should 
be presented in terms of Withdrawal capacity, 
treatment capacity, distribution capacity, 
or other capacity limiting factors. The 
capacity of the existing systems must represent 
the state of the systems. Existing capacity 
determinations shall be based upon 
approval limits or the most restrictive capacity 
information. 

‘‘b. For all purposes of this Compact, volumes 
of Diversions, Consumptive Uses, or 
Withdrawals of Water set forth in the list(s) 

prepared by each Party in accordance with 
this Section, shall constitute the baseline 
volume. 

‘‘c. The list(s) shall be furnished to the Regional 
Body and the Council within one year 
of the effective date of this Compact. 

‘‘3. Timing of Additional Applications. Applications 
for New or Increased Withdrawals, 
Consumptive Uses or Exceptions shall be 
considered cumulatively within ten years of 
any application. 

‘‘4. Change of Ownership. Unless a new 
owner proposes a project that shall result in 
a Proposal for a New or Increased Diversion 
or Consumptive Use subject to Regional Review 
or Council approval, the change of ownership 
in and of itself shall not require Regional 
Review or Council approval. 

‘‘5. Groundwater. The Basin surface water 
divide shall be used for the purpose of managing 
and regulating New or Increased Diversions, 
Consumptive Uses or Withdrawals of 
surface water and groundwater. 

‘‘6. Withdrawal Systems. The total volume 
of surface water and groundwater resources 
that supply a common distribution system 
shall determine the volume of a Withdrawal, 
Consumptive Use or Diversion. 

‘‘7. Connecting Channels. The watershed of 
each Great Lake shall include its upstream 
and downstream connecting channels. 

‘‘8. Transmission in Water Lines. Transmission 
of Water within a line that extends 
outside the Basin as it conveys Water from 
one point to another within the Basin shall 
not be considered a Diversion if none of the 
Water is used outside the Basin. 

‘‘9. Hydrologic Units. The Lake Michigan 
and Lake Huron watersheds shall be considered 
to be a single hydrologic unit and watershed. 


‘‘10. Bulk Water Transfer. A Proposal to 
Withdraw Water and to remove it from the 
Basin in any container greater than 5.7 gallons 
shall be treated under this Compact in 
the same manner as a Proposal for a Diversion. 
Each Party shall have the discretion, 
within its jurisdiction, to determine the 
treatment of Proposals to Withdraw Water 
and to remove it from the Basin in any container 
of 5.7 gallons or less. 
‘‘Section 4.13. Exemptions. 

‘‘Withdrawals from the Basin for the following 
purposes are exempt from the requirements

‘‘1. To supply vehicles, including vessels 
and aircraft, whether for the needs of the 
persons or animals being transported or for 
ballast or other needs related to the operation 
of the vehicles. 

‘‘2. To use in a non-commercial project on 
a short-term basis for firefighting, humanitarian, 
or emergency response purposes.

‘‘1. Notwithstanding any terms of this 
Compact to the contrary, with the exception 
of Paragraph 5 of this Section, current, New 
or Increased Withdrawals, Consumptive Uses 
and Diversions of Basin Water by the State 
of Illinois shall be governed by the terms of 
the United States Supreme Court decree in 
Wisconsin et al. v. Illinois et al. and shall 
not be subject to the terms of this Compact 
nor any rules or regulations promulgated 
pursuant to this Compact. This means that, 
with the exception of Paragraph 5 of this 
Section, for purposes of this Compact, current, 
New or Increased Withdrawals, Consumptive 
Uses and Diversions of Basin Water 
within the State of Illinois shall be allowed 
unless prohibited by the terms of the United 
States Supreme Court decree in Wisconsin et 
al. v. Illinois et al.

al. v. Illinois et al., any other party from objecting 
to any request by the State of Illinois 
for additional Basin Water under the 
terms of said decree, or any party from seeking 
any other type of modification to said 
decree. If an application is made by any 
party to the Supreme Court of the United 
States to modify said decree, the Parties to 
this Compact who are also parties to the decree 
shall seek formal input from the Canadian 
Provinces of Ontario and Que´bec, with 
respect to the proposed modification, use 
best efforts to facilitate the appropriate participation 
of said Provinces in the proceedings 
to modify the decree, and shall not 
unreasonably impede or restrict such participation. 


‘‘3. With the exception of Paragraph 5 of 
this Section, because current, New or Increased 
Withdrawals, Consumptive Uses and 
Diversions of Basin Water by the State of Illinois 
are not subject to the terms of this 
Compact, the State of Illinois is prohibited 
from using any term of this Compact, including 
Section 4.9, to seek New or Increased 
Withdrawals, Consumptive Uses or Diversions 
of Basin Water.

all terms of this Compact, except Paragraphs 
1, 3 and 4 of this Section. 

‘‘6. For purposes of the State of Illinois’ 
participation in this Compact, the entirety 
of this Section 4.14 is necessary for the continued 
implementation of this Compact and, 
if severed, this Compact shall no longer be 
binding on or enforceable by or against the 
State of Illinois.

‘‘1. The Parties in cooperation with the 
Provinces shall collectively conduct within 
the Basin, on a Lake watershed and St. Lawrence 
River Basin basis, a periodic assessment 
of the Cumulative Impacts of Withdrawals, 
Diversions and Consumptive Uses 
from the Waters of the Basin, every 5 years 
or each time the incremental Basin Water 
losses reach 50 million gallons per day average 
in any 90-day period in excess of the 
quantity at the time of the most recent assessment, 
whichever comes first, or at the 
request of one or more of the Parties. The assessment 
shall form the basis for a review of 
the Standard of Review and Decision, Council 
and Party regulations and their application. 
This assessment shall: 

‘‘a. Utilize the most current and appropriate 
guidelines for such a review, which 
may include but not be limited to Council on

conducting this Cumulative Impact assessment. 
Applicants are not required to participate 
in this assessment. 

‘‘3. Unless required by other statutes, Applicants 
are not required to conduct a separate 
cumulative impact assessment in connection 
with an Application but shall submit 
information about the potential impacts of a 
Proposal to the quantity or quality of the 
Waters and Water Dependent Natural Resources 
of the applicable Source Watershed. 
An Applicant may, however, provide an analysis 
of how their Proposal meets the no significant 
adverse Cumulative Impact provision 
of the Standard of Review and Decision.

on February 13, 2003. 

There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 

Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the resolution be agreed 
to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion 
to reconsider be laid upon the 
table, with no intervening action or debate, 
and that any statements be printed 
in the RECORD. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

The resolution (S. Res. 627) was 
agreed to. 

The preamble was agreed to. 

The resolution, with its preamble, 
reads as follows: 

S. RES. 627 

Whereas a Congressional Resolution in 2007 

(S. Con. Res. 53) condemned the kidnapping 
and hostage-taking of three citizens of the 
United States, Keith Stansell, Thomas 
Howes, and Marc Gonsalves for over four 
years by the FARC, and demanded their immediate 
and unconditional release; 
Whereas the Senate expresses sorrow at 
the murder of Tom Janis by the FARC, another 
citizen of the United States that was 
on the downed aircraft, and Luis Alcedes 
Cruz, a member of the Colombian military, 
as well as citizens of the United States who 
died during a hostage search mission in 2003; 

Whereas the Government of Colombia carried 
out a historic rescue mission on July 2, 
2008, freeing 15 hostages who the FARC had 
kidnapped and held in captivity, including 
these three citizens of the United States, Ingrid 
Betancourt, and military and police personnel 
of Colombia; 

Whereas the armed forces of Colombia 
planned, led, and executed the rescue operation 
without a single gunshot; 

Whereas the United States Government 
played a key supportive role in the rescue 
mission by the armed forces of Colombia; 

Whereas the FARC is designated as a foreign 
terrorist organization by the Department 
of State and the European Union; 

Whereas the FARC utilizes kidnappings for 
ransom, extortion, and the drug trade to finance 
its activities; 

Whereas the FARC committed atrocities 
against citizens of both Colombia and the 
United States; 

Whereas the FARC has kidnapped at least 
36 citizens of the United States since 1980, 
and killed 10 citizens of the United States; 

Whereas the FARC currently holds an estimated 
700 people as hostages; and 

Whereas over 50 FARC leaders have been 
indicted in the United States for drug trafficking: 
Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) welcomes Keith Stansell, Thomas 
Howes, and Marc Gonsalves home to the 
United States after being held for over five 
years by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia (FARC); 
(2) celebrates with the families and relatives 
of the hostages who kept faith despite 
being unsure of the fates of their family 
members for more than five years; 
(3) expresses gratitude to the Government 
of Colombia and the armed forces of Colombia 
for successfully rescuing the hostages, 
and applauds the effective contribution of 
the United States Government to this effort; 
(4) calls for the immediate release of all 
hostages held by the FARC and other armed 
terrorist groups in Colombia; and 
(5) urges the FARC to lay down their weapons 
and reject terrorism.

NATIONAL TRUANCY PREVENTION 
MONTH 

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consideration 
of Calendar No. 924, S. Res. 624. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 

The assistant legislative clerk read 
as follows: 

A resolution (S. Res. 624) designating August 
2008 as ‘‘National Truancy Prevention 
Month.’’ 

There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the resolution 
be agreed to, the preamble be agreed 
to, and the motions to reconsider be 
laid upon the table, with no intervening 
action or debate, and that any 
statements related to the resolution be 
printed in the RECORD. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

The resolution (S. Res. 624) was 
agreed to. 

The preamble was agreed to. 

The resolution, with its preamble, 

reads as follows: 
S. RES. 624 
Whereas public schools in the United 
States are facing a dropout crisis, with approximately 
1,200,000 students not graduating 
from high school on time and only 70 
percent of students earning high school diplomas; 
Whereas truancy has been shown to be the 
first and best indicator that a child will drop 
out of school, use marijuana for the first 


S8016 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

time, and commit juvenile crimes by the age 
of 15; 

Whereas the incidence of truancy in a recent 
national survey found that 11 percent of 
eighth grade students, 16 percent of tenth 
grade students, and 35 percent of twelfth 
grade students reported skipping 1 or more 
days of school during the previous 30 days; 

Whereas chronic truants often miss more 
days of school than they attend; 

Whereas absentee rates relate directly to 
graduation rates and are highest in public 
schools in urban areas; 

Whereas truant eighth graders are more 
likely to say they do not believe they will 
graduate from high school or attend college 
than their peers who attend regularly; 

Whereas truancy has been found to be a 
risk factor for substance abuse, teen pregnancy, 
and school dropout; 

Whereas the average annual income for a 
high school dropout in 2005 was $17,299, compared 
to $26,933 for a high school graduate; 

Whereas it has been demonstrated that 
when truancy is addressed, there is a reduction 
in the rates of daytime crime, juvenile 
crime, drug use, and delinquency; 

Whereas effective truancy reduction programs 
can take many forms and can be implemented 
in many different settings, including 
in schools, courts, and through community 
programs; 

Whereas truancy prevention programs focused 
on middle grade students are key to 
preventing future dropouts; and 

Whereas truancy reduction programs are 
highly cost effective, reduce juvenile and 
adult crime, and save taxpayer money: Now, 
therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) designates August 2008 as ‘‘National 
Truancy Prevention Month’’; 
(2) recognizes the significant harm of 
chronic truancy to the youth of the United 
States; 
(3) acknowledges the work being done by 
truancy prevention programs throughout the 
United States to help at-risk youth; and 
(4) encourages law enforcement, school officials, 
the judiciary, community leaders, 
and the business community to work together 
to address truancy.

NATIONAL AIRBORNE DAY 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Judiciary 
Committee be discharged and the Senate 
now proceed to the consideration of 
S. Res. 625. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the resolution 
by title. 
The assistant legislative clerk read 
as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 625) designating August 
16, 2008, as National Airborne Day. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the resolution 
be agreed to, the preamble be agreed 
to, and the motions to reconsider be 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 625) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
The resolution, with its preamble, 
reads as follows: 
S. RES. 625 
Whereas the airborne forces of the Armed 
Forces have a long and honorable history as 

units of adventuresome, hardy, and fierce 
warriors who, for the national security of the 
United States and the defense of freedom and 
peace, project the effective ground combat 
power of the United States by Air Force air 
transport to the far reaches of the battle 
area and, indeed, to the far corners of the 
world; 

Whereas August 16 marks the anniversary 
of the first official Army parachute jump on 
August 16, 1940, an event that validated the 
innovative concept of inserting United 
States ground combat forces behind the battle 
line by means of a parachute; 

Whereas the United States experiment of 
airborne infantry attack began on June 25, 
1940, when the Army Parachute Test Platoon 
was first authorized by the Department of 
War, and was launched when 48 volunteers 
began training in July 1940; 

Whereas the success of the Parachute Test 
Platoon in the days immediately preceding 
the entry of the United States into World 
War II led to the formation of a formidable 
force of airborne units that have served with 
distinction and have had repeated success in 
armed hostilities; 

Whereas among those airborne units are 
the former 11th, 13th, and 17th Airborne Divisions, 
the venerable 82nd Airborne Division, 
the versatile 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), 
and the airborne regiments and battalions 
(some as components of those divisions, 
some as separate units) that achieved 
distinction as the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, 
the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the 187th 
Infantry (Airborne) Regiment, the 503rd, 
507th, 508th, 517th, 541st, and 542nd Parachute 
Infantry Regiments, the 88th Glider Infantry 
Regiment, the 509th, 551st, and 555th Parachute 
Infantry Battalions, the 325th and 
327th Glider Infantry, and the 550th Airborne 
Infantry Battalion; 

Whereas the achievements of the airborne 
forces during World War II prompted the evolution 
of those forces into a diversified force 
of parachute and air assault units that, over 
the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, 
Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf region, 
and Somalia, and have engaged in peacekeeping 
operations in Lebanon, the Sinai Peninsula, 
the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, 
and Kosovo; 

Whereas the modern-day airborne force 
that has evolved from those World War II beginnings 
is an agile, powerful force that, in 
large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne 
Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), 
and the 75th Ranger Regiment; 

Whereas the modern-day airborne force 
also includes other elite forces composed entirely 
of airborne trained and qualified special 
operations warriors, including Army 
Special Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance 
units, Navy SEALs, and Air Force 
combat control teams, all or most of which 
comprise the forces of the United States Special 
Operations Command; 

Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist 
attacks on the United States on September 
11, 2001, the 75th Ranger Regiment, special 
forces units, and units of the 82nd Airborne 
Division and the 101st Airborne Division (Air 
Assault), together with other units of the 
Armed Forces, have been prosecuting the 
war against terrorism by carrying out combat 
operations in Afghanistan, training operations 
in the Philippines, and other operations 
elsewhere; 

Whereas in the aftermath of the President’s 
announcement of Operation Iraqi 
Freedom in March 2003, the 75th Ranger 
Regiment, special forces units, and units of 
the 82nd Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne 
Division (Air Assault), the 173rd Airborne 
Brigade, and the 4th Brigade Combat 
Team (Airborne) of the 25th Infantry Division, 
together with other units of the Armed 

Forces, have been prosecuting the war 
against terrorism, carrying out combat operations, 
conducting civil affairs missions, and 
assisting in establishing democracy in Iraq; 

Whereas the airborne forces are and will 
continue to be at the ready and the forefront 
until the Global War on Terrorism is concluded; 


Whereas of the members and former members 
of the United States airborne forces, all 
have achieved distinction by earning the 
right to wear the airborne’s ‘‘Silver Wings of 
Courage’’, thousands have achieved the distinction 
of making combat jumps, 69 have 
earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds 
have earned the Distinguished-Service Cross, 
Silver Star, or other decorations and awards 
for displays of such traits as heroism, gallantry, 
intrepidity, and valor; 

Whereas the members and former members 
of the United States airborne forces are 
members of a proud and honorable fraternity 
of the profession of arms that is made exclusive 
by those distinctions which, together 
with their special skills and achievements, 
distinguish them as intrepid combat parachutists, 
special operation forces, and (in 
former days) glider troops; 

Whereas the history and achievements of 
the members and former members of the airborne 
forces of the United States Armed 
Forces warrant special expressions of the 
gratitude of the American people; and 

Whereas, since the airborne community 
celebrates August 16 as the anniversary of 
the first official jump by the Army Parachute 
Test Platoon, August 16 would be an 
appropriate day to recognize as National Airborne 
Day: Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) designates August 16, 2008, as ‘‘National 
Airborne Day’’; and 
(2) calls on the people of the United States 
to observe ‘‘National Airborne Day’’ with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities.

CIVIL RIGHTS-ERA MURDER CASES: ‘‘ANOTHER 
DAY FOR JUSTICE’’—SELF-TAUGHT LEGAL 
EXPERT ALVIN SYKES ISONA QUEST TO GET 
LONG-UNPURSUED SUSPECTS INTO COURT BEFORE 
IT’S TOO LATE 

(By Drew Jubera) 
JACKSON, MISS.—A fourth-floor courtroom 
filled here last week much the way Southern 
courtrooms now fill every few years for a 
civil rights-era murder case. 
The 71-year-old defendant, James Seale, requested 
headphones as he sat with his lawyers 
during jury selection so he could hear 
the proceedings. 
The former crop duster and reputed Klansman 
is charged with kidnapping and conspiracy 
in connection with the May 2, 1964, 
abduction and killings of two black teenagers. 
The bodies of Henry Dee and Charles 
Moore were found in the Mississippi River, 
tied to a Jeep engine block. 
Seale has pleaded not guilty to the federal 
charges. 
Also inside the downtown courthouse: 
aging relatives of the murdered boys, includ


ing Thomas Moore, 63, a Vietnam veteran 
who worked almost a decade to get his 
brother’s moldering case reopened. 

Before entering this historic scene and sitting 
in a rear pew, Alvin Sykes tugged at his 
blue-jean jacket, stroked his scraggly goatee 
and exhaled. 

‘‘Another day for justice,’’ said Sykes, an 
improbable presence at yet another improbable 
decades-old case. 

Sykes, a high school dropout and practicing 
Buddhist who once lived in a homeless 
shelter and learned the law reading books in 
public libraries, has become both a catalyst 
and an inspiration during the 11th-hour rush 
to reopen these old murder cases before the 
killers die off. 

Since 1989, authorities in Mississippi and 
six other states have re-examined 29 civil 
rights-era murders, with 28 resulting arrests 
and 22 convictions. 

The FBI has uncovered 51 more killings, 
and the Southern Poverty Law Center has a 
list of 127 race-related killings between 1954 
and 1968. 

It’s in this atmosphere that Sykes has brokered 
meetings with people as various as 

U.S. senators, district attorneys and victims’ 
relatives to seek long-delayed justice. 
His behind-the-scenes maneuvering was 
key to the FBI’s reinvestigation of the infamous 
1955 murder of Emmett Till, a black 
Chicago teen brutally killed after he allegedly 
whistled at a white woman in Money, 
Miss. (Earlier this year, a Mississippi grand 
jury did not return an indictment in the 
case.) 

Sykes also generated the idea for legislation 
now before Congress that grew out of 
the reopening of that now-52-year-old slaying. 
Commonly known as the Till Bill, and 
sponsored in the House of Representatives by 
Rep. John Lewis (D–Ga.), it would fund a separate 
unit in the Justice Department devoted 
to investigating civil rights-era 
crimes. 

‘‘He’s a warrior,’’ said Moore of the mild-
mannered Sykes, whom he credits with inspiring 
him while he sought justice for his 
brother. ‘‘Every now and then a person 
comes along who you say, ‘Where’d this guy 
come from?’ Alvin’s one of those guys. He 
might not have this degree or that background, 
but he has a lot of dedication and 
inner strength.’’ 

Added Margaret Burnham, a Northeastern 
University law professor who recently invited 
Sykes to speak at a conference in Boston 
about civil rights-era cases, co-sponsored 
by Harvard University, ‘‘He’s a completely 
self-taught man who’s incredibly skilled at 
knowing what buttons to push, when to push 
them and what cases the government might 
respond to. He’s better at it than hundreds of 
people I’ve met in my long life as a civil 
rights lawyer. 

‘‘He brings a passion and insight to the 
work that would be extraordinary for anybody—
a university-trained academic or law-
yer—but it’s particularly extraordinary 
given his personal history.’’ 

Sykes was born to a 14-year-old at a home 
for unwed mothers, then taken in by a single 
48-year-old friend of the family in Kansas 
City, Mo. He was sickly, in and out of hospitals 
with epilepsy, and says around age 11 
he was sexually abused by a couple that lived 
across the street. 

His formal education was spotty—he spent 
three years at Boys Town, the facility for at-
risk kids in Omaha—then left school for good 
at 16. 

He lived briefly with his biological moth-
er—he thought for years she was a cousin— 
but says she was an alcoholic and rarely employed. 
He ran into her years later when he 
was homeless. She lived at the same shelter. 

But Sykes calls leaving school the start of 
his education. Working nights managing a 

band, he spent his days holed up in a library. 
‘‘Education was important to me—that’s the 
reason I left school,’’ he said. ‘‘The administration 
was more concerned with students 
getting a piece of paper than an education. 
So I started teaching myself.’’ 

He also sat in on trials, watching legal 
strategies, researching what he didn’t understand. 
He became involved in a federal desegregation 
case with the Kansas City public 
schools and befriended a Justice Department 
official. ‘‘I learned about cases and the system 
and started applying it to real matters,’’ 
he said. 

Sykes’ work as a victims’ advocate became 
locally renowned after a string of Kansas 
City musicians were murdered in the late 
’70s and early ’80s. When a white defendant 
was acquitted of beating a prominent black 
musician to death, Sykes went back to the 
library with the victim’s wife. ‘‘It was like in 
the movies,’’ he recalled. ‘‘We just kept 
opening books. Then 10 minutes before closing 
time, I found it.’’ 

Sykes unearthed an obscure federal statute 
that allowed the defendant to be prosecuted 
on a civil rights violation. He sent everything 
he found to Justice Department lawyer 
Richard Roberts, now a federal judge in 
Washington, who got an indictment. The defendant 
was convicted and received a life 
sentence. 

‘‘His seriousness of purpose was impressive,’’ 
Roberts said. ‘‘It made answering his 
phone calls much more attractive.’’ 

Sykes had worked for or founded a variety 
of local victims’ rights groups, rarely living 
on more than $10,000 a year, when in 2003 he 
read a story about Till’s mother wanting her 
son’s case reopened. Two documentarians 
also suggested there were living suspects beyond 
the two men, now dead, who were acquitted 
of the 14-year-old’s murder but later 
bragged about it in an article. 

Sykes and Donald Burger, a retired Justice 
Department official who befriended Sykes 
during the school desegregation case, met 
with Mamie Till-Mobley in Chicago and 
talked about pursuing the case. Till-Mobley 
died days later, after co-founding, with 
Sykes and others, the Emmett Till Justice 
Campaign. 

‘‘Alvin was the aggressor,’’ said Wheeler 
Parker, 68, who traveled with Till, his cousin, 
from Chicago to Mississippi in 1955. ‘‘Don 
had more contacts and knowledge, but Alvin 
had the aggressiveness and nerve to pursue 
it. The fire’s in his belly.’’ 

Sykes arranged a meeting in Oxford, Miss., 
with a U.S. attorney, the district attorney 
who would prosecute the case, a Till relative 
and documentarian Keith Beauchamp. The 
FBI soon agreed to investigate the case for 
local authorities. 

‘‘He was a very adept facilitator,’’ recalled 
Jim Greenlee, the U.S. attorney. ‘‘Without 
his efforts, the chances for the investigation 
being reopened would have been much less. I 
call him a catalyst.’’ 

During the Till investigation, Sykes became 
aware of dozens of other cold cases 
from that era. He couldn’t create a justice 
campaign for each one, so he envisioned a 
unit within the Justice Department with the 
money, resources and expertise to investigate 
them all. He sold the idea to Missouri’s 
conservative Republican Sen. Jim 
Talent, who introduced the so-called Till Bill 
in 2005. 

Talent, who credits Sykes with the initial 
idea, lost re-election last year, and the original 
bill stalled. But the Emmett Till Unsolved 
Civil Rights Crime Act has been reintroduced 
by Reps. Lewis and Kenny 
Hulshof (R–Mo.) in the House and Sens. Chris 
Dodd (D–Conn.) and Patrick Leahy (D–Vt.). 
It provides $11.5 million annually to look 
into the era’s unsolved murders, and political 
observers say its chances now look good. 
Many give Sykes credit. 


S8018 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

‘‘He has played the role of public advocate 
on Capitol Hill to remind legislators who 
may not have experienced the tragedy of segregation 
and racial discrimination that unsolved 
crimes against African-Americans 
have left an intolerable stain on our democracy,’’ 
said Brenda Jones, spokeswoman for 
Lewis. ‘‘He has helped remind many members 
of Congress that we must take steps to 
right these wrongs.’’ 

Leaving the Jackson courthouse during a 
break in the Seale trial, which continues 
with jury selection this week, Sykes shook 
his head. 

‘‘I was sitting there thinking, ‘When I was 
16, it was just like this.’ I was sitting in a 
courtroom, getting an education.’’ 

Sykes sometimes wishes he could return to 
the music business, make a better living, 
have a better life. Living off donations, some 
speaking fees and a book Till’s mother wrote 
that he sometimes sells out of a bag, he 
doesn’t even own a car. Friends drove him to 
Jackson. 

But he says he can’t leave the cause yet. 
There are still too many low-profile cases he 
worries will stay lost. Even the Till case languished 
five decades without a reinvestigation. 


‘‘The thing that gets me [maddest] in 
terms of the Till case,’’ he said, ‘‘is the realization 
that [the two killers who were acquitted 
on murder charges] could have been 
tried for kidnapping before they died. 

‘‘I have a chip on my shoulder about all 
the people more knowledgeable than me who 
could have pursued that case. On my more 
benevolent days, I say they just didn’t know 
the law enough. On my most cynical days, I 
say it was just too much work.’’ 

SYKES’ SUCCESSES 
Sykes’ behind-the-scenes maneuvering was 
key to the FBI’s reinvestigation of the 1955 
murder of Emmett Till. 
Sykes generated the idea for legislation 
that would create a separate unit in the Justice 
Department devoted to civil rights-era 
crimes. 
DECADES-OLD CRIMES

JULY 31, 2008. 

DEAR SENATOR COBURN: First allow me to 
extend our appreciation and admiration for 
you and your staff for assistance and communication 
with us concerning S. 535, the 
Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime 
Act. While we still believe that the hold that 
you placed on our bill was not the good way 
to effect the institutional change in the 
manner that the United States Senate does 
business, we do appreciate the open lines of 
communication and respect that your staff, 
in particular Brooke Bacak and Tim 
Tardibono, have shown in negotiating with 
us on proposed language and conditions that 
would address your concern and minimize 
the loss we have suffered from going this 
route. Therefore our Board of Directors has 
voted to endorse a unanimous consent agreement 
that would include the latest draft language 
that rectifies the concerns with the 
controversy over the Attorney having authority 
to reprogram funds from one congressionally 
directed fund to another by 
eliminating all reference to reprogramming 
and replacing with prioritizing spending request 
if Congress does not fully fund the Till 
Bill. Furthermore we support you having the 
right to submit this language as an amendment 
in the cloture vote process as long as 
the floor debate time is limited and that you 
would not replace your hold on our bill if 

your amendment fails. Nothing in this request 
is meant to criticize the Senate Leadership 
on the enormous work that they have 
done to craft and advocate for the passage of 
this bill, especially the good work of Patrick 
Grant in Senator Dodd’s office and Darrell 
Thompson in Senate Majority leader Harry 
Reid’s office who has kept hope alive on this 
historic bill. However we firmly believe that 
truth and justice can be best achieved by 
opening and maintaining effective lines of 
communication and searching for a win-win 
justice seeking solution. We further believe 
that since you started this by placing your 
hold on our bill, you should be the one to finish 
it. Therefore the Emmett Till Justice 
Campaign, Inc. requests that you make an 
overture to the Democratic Leadership and 
the sponsors of the Till Bill by introducing 
the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights 
Crime Act, as proposed amended, under the 
Unanimous Concent Agreement outlined 
above tonight in the interest of time, truth 
and justice. 

Sincerely, in the pursuit of justice, I 
am,

U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, June 25, 2007. 

Senator CHRISTOPHER J. DODD, 

Russell Senate Office Building, 
Washington, DC. 

DEAR CHRIS: As you know, I have not 
agreed to a unanimous consent request for 
the Senate to approve S. 535/H.R. 923, not because 
I disagree with the well intended motives 
of the legislation, but because it violates 
the principles I use to evaluate every 
piece of legislation. I sent you and the other 
members of the Senate a copy of these principles 
in February. 

Among these principles are: If a bill creates 
or authorizes a new federal program or 
activity, it must not duplicate an existing 
program or activity; and if a bill authorizes 
new spending, it must be offset by reductions 
in real spending elsewhere. 

Your bill both creates a new government 
program that duplicates an existing program 
and authorizes new government spending 
without offsetting the costs. 

The bill authorizes $115 million over 10 
years to investigate murders committed before 
1970 that have gone unpunished. Perhaps 
you are unaware, but the Department of Justice 
initiated an effort over a year ago to do 
just this. 

In February 2006, a full year before you introduced 
your bill, the U.S. Attorney General 
and the FBI director announced a partnership 
with the NAACP, the Southern Poverty 
Law Center and the National Urban 
League to investigate unsolved crimes from 
the civil rights era. Attorney General 
Alberto Gonzales has pledged that ‘‘The Justice 
Department is committed to investigating 
and prosecuting civil-rights era 
homicides for as long as it takes and as far 
as the law allows—because there is no statute 
of limitations on human dignity and justice.’’ 


According to the FBI, ‘‘in February 2006, 
the FBI enacted an initiative to identify 
hate crimes that occurred prior to December 
1969, and resulted in death.’’ The Bureau’s 56 
field offices have been directed to re-examine 
their unsolved civil rights cases and determine 
which ones could still be viable for 
prosecution. The FBI has partnered with a 
number of state and local authorities, civic 
organizations, and community leaders to reexamine 
old files. Since the initiative began, 
the FBI has received nearly 100 such referrals. 
The FBI is continuing to assess each referral 
for its investigative and legal viability 

and, given the updated investigative and forensic 
tools, move forward in investigating 
these cases. 

The Department of Justice is not lacking 
resources either. At the end of Fiscal Year 
2006, the Department had $2.5 billion in unobligated 
balances, which is unspent money. 
The Department is expected to have $1.6 billion 
in unobligated balances at the end of 
Fiscal Years 2007 and 2008. 

Because the FBI is already working on this 
issue and the Justice Department has billions 
of unspent dollars, I am unsure why 
creating new government programs and authorizing 
more than $100 million in new 
spending is necessary. 

If authorizing more spending for this ongoing 
effort, however, is necessary, we could 
pay for it with unspent Department funds or 
with offsets from existing lower priority 
spending, as I have proposed doing. 

I realize that many members of the Senate 
do not care about our national debt which is 
why it is nearly $9 trillion. Most Senators, 
including you, voted to kill a Sense of Senate 
resolution stating that Congress has a 
moral obligation to offset the cost of new 
Government programs and initiatives. You 
even voted to fund the infamous ‘‘Bridges to 
Nowhere’’ in Alaska which cost half a billion 
dollars! 

So while you may not concern yourself 
with our national debt or the impact of adding 
to it, I do. That it why I was very disappointed 
that you issued a press statement 
last week claiming that I am ‘‘delaying this 
bill’s passage under false pretense.’’ 

If you really care about this issue and the 
economic future of our nation, I would hope 
that you would actually discuss the matter 
directly with me instead of holding press 
conferences and issuing press releases. In 
fact, my office did make an offer to your 
staff to find a way to pay for this bill, which 
was rejected. 

If you have any interest in passing this bill 
in a fiscally responsible manner, please contact 
me. In the meantime, you can rest assured 
that the Attorney General and the FBI 
are already conducting the investigations 
that your bill seeks to address. 

Sincerely, 

TOM A. COBURN, M.D., 

U.S. Senator. 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, June 19, 2008. 

Senator CHRISTOPHER J. DODD, 

Russell Senate Office Building, 
Washington, DC. 

DEAR SENATOR DODD: As you are aware, I 
am ready to enter into a unanimous consent 
agreement on S. 535, the Emmett Till Unsolved 
Civil Rights Crime Act. This weekend 
marks the anniversary of the murders of 
three civil rights workers in Mississippi, and 
I believe it is an opportune time for the Senate 
to give this bill the vote it deserves. To 
that end, I have offered four amendments for 
your consideration. Unfortunately, until you 
agree to allow me to offer these amendments 
on the floor, the Senate is prevented from 
moving to the bill. My hope is that we can 
resolve this issue soon, so that the Senate 
may consider S. 535 immediately. 

I have always supported the admirable goal 
of this legislation: namely, to ensure that 
perpetrators of heinous civil rights cold case 
crimes are finally brought to justice. I was 
pleased to learn of the Government’s efforts 
to identify and prosecute these crimes, initiated 
a full year before your bill was introduced. 
It remains my desire to see these efforts 
continue, but I insist that they be done 
in a fiscally responsible manner. 

My concerns with this bill have always involved 
its cost, and I have worked consistently 
to identify possible offsets. I made 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8019 

known these concerns as early as August 
2006, when the measure was first considered 
by the Senate Judiciary Committee. At that 
time, the bill’s sponsor worked with me to 
find an agreeable offset; however, our proposals 
were ultimately rejected by an 
unnamed Senator. In June 2007, I had another 
opportunity to explain my concerns 
when the bill again came before the Committee. 
Additionally, more than three 
months before I publicly objected to your request 
for unanimous consent to consider the 
bill on the floor, I sent you a letter explaining 
in detail my position on the bill. Finally, 
in October 2007, I offered an amendment to 
provide $1.68 million to investigate and prosecute 
unsolved civil rights crimes by transferring 
funds from other wasteful programs. 
That amendment was defeated after a majority 
of the Senate, including 11 of the bill’s 
sponsors, voted to table it. 

Even if I had not been so vocal about this 
bill in the 109th Congress, the letter I sent to 
you and all of my Senate colleagues in February 
2007 should have left no doubt about 
my position this year. That letter outlined 
the principles I use to evaluate legislation, 
which include: If a bill creates or authorizes 
a new federal program or activity, it must 
not duplicate an existing program or activity; 
and if a bill authorizes new spending it 
must be offset by reductions in real spending 
elsewhere. 

Because S. 535 both creates a new, duplicative 
government program and authorizes new 
government spending without offsetting the 
costs, you had ample notice—long before you 
hotlined the bill—that I would object. 

Because of the knowledge you had about 
negotiations that occurred in the previous 
Congress, my staff’s earlier failed efforts to 
negotiate an offset with your staff, and my 
own public statements, there has been a consistent 
understanding of my willingness to 
allow the full Senate to consider S. 535. My 
only desire is to be permitted to offer amendments 
to the bill. I regret that my position 
has been unfairly—and incorrectly—characterized 
as an insurmountable obstacle to 
final passage. 

Although my office has not been contacted 
by yours (or any other bill sponsors) since 
before the press conference you held to question 
my intentions on this bill, I have been 
in frequent contact with the Emmett Till 
Justice Campaign. That Campaign is undoubtedly 
the bill’s greatest supporter, and 
the persistent efforts of President Alvin 
Sykes have outdone any member of the Senate, 
both in character and enthusiasm. It has 
been my privilege to work directly with Mr. 
Sykes, and it is to his credit that so much 
progress has been made these past few 
months. We could all stand to learn from his 
example. 

In short, the purpose of this letter is to secure 
your commitment to a UC agreement 
allowing me to offer four amendments to S. 
535 during floor debate. If you will do so, I 
am prepared to take up the bill immediately. 
Especially given the timeliness of this weekend’s 
memorials commemorating the 44th 
anniversary of the deaths of three civil 
rights martyrs, I see no reason for further 
delay. 

Sincerely, 

TOM A. COBURN, M.D., 

U.S. Senator. 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, June 19, 2008. 

Senator HARRY REID, 

Hart Senate Office Building, 
Washington, DC. 

DEAR SENATOR REID: The purpose of this 
letter is to reiterate my willingness to enter 
into a unanimous consent agreement allowing 
floor consideration of S. 535, the Emmett 

Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. I understand 
that your staff, along with that of 
the bill’s sponsor, is still considering the 
four amendments I have proposed as a condition 
of my consent. My hope is that we can 
resolve this issue soon, so that the Senate 
may consider S. 535 immediately. 

I have been disappointed in the progress of 
this bill. Although I made known my specific 
concerns over the bill’s cost as early as August 
2006, my intentions have repeatedly 
been questioned both by members of the 
media and the Senate. The attacks have been 
disingenuous, as I have always supported the 
admirable goal of this legislation: namely, to 
ensure that perpetrators of heinous civil 
rights cold case crimes are finally brought to 
justice. Consistent with the position I have 
taken toward all legislation authorizing new 
spending in the 110th Congress, I exercised 
my right to withhold consent on S. 535. 

I have, however, always made known my 
willingness to work with bill sponsors on 
identifying needed offsets. Because they 
have been unwilling to accept my offers and 
have shown no willingness to otherwise negotiate, 
the Senate must now consider the 
bill on the floor. In order for this to happen, 
we must reach an agreement as to time and 
amendments. I have put forth my request for 
consent to offer four amendments and continue 
to await a response. 

Although my office has not been contacted 
since last year by any Senator seeking to 
move this bill, I have been in frequent contact 
with the Emmett Till Justice Campaign. 
That Campaign is undoubtedly the 
bill’s greatest supporter, and the persistent 
efforts of President Alvin Sykes have outdone 
any member of the Senate, both in 
character and enthusiasm. It has been my 
privilege to work directly with Mr. Sykes, 
and it is to his credit that so much progress 
has been made these past few months. We 
could all stand to learn from his example. 

This weekend marks the 44th anniversary 
of the murders of three civil rights workers 
in Mississippi. The occasion makes consideration 
of this bill especially timely, and I 
want to make clear that I support prompt 
consideration. Please give me a response on 
my request to offer four amendments so that 
the Senate is able to take up S. 535 as soon 
as possible. 

Thanks, 

TOM A. COBURN, M.D., 

U.S. Senator. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the

SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 2004, 
when I was selected by my peers as the 
Democratic leader, the first public appearance 
I made following the vote we 
had, I walked out to the press and said 
I would rather dance than fight. I still 
feel that way. I was elected to the Senate 
because the people of Nevada knew 
I was a good Democrat but that I always 
would eagerly reach across the 
table and find common ground wherever 
possible. I guess I learned that in 
the courtroom in working cases. You 
have to be willing to compromise in 
the law, as you do in politics. I have a 
strong conviction, that is true. 

There is no better example of that 
than my relationship with JOHN ENSIGN. 
JOHN ENSIGN, the junior Senator 
from Nevada, and I had a bitter race in 
1998. He was a Member of Congress. I 
was a sitting Senator. He ran against 
me. That was a close race. No one ever 
thought we would wind up in the Senate 
together, but as fortune spins, Senator 
Bryant unexpectedly decided not 
to run for reelection, and JOHN ENSIGN 
was able to come to the Senate. 

For 8 years, we have worked to develop 
a relationship that has turned 
into a strong friendship. JOHN ENSIGN 
and I, though we disagree on some political 
issues, never, ever publicly or 
privately discuss our differences politically. 


I mention that because we need in 
the Senate to work together. Even 
though we may have different political 
views on different aspects of Government, 
we need to work together. It 
may not be apparent to those who 
watch the daily skirmishes of the Senate 
from afar, but I try to approach 
every issue in this Congress with the 
same eagerness to find common ground 
that I do working with Senator ENSIGN. 

There have been occasions—not often 
enough—where Republican colleagues 
have joined Democrats in the pursuit 
of progress. When they have chosen 
that path, we have, together, accomplished 
some very good things for the 
American people, even in this work period, 
which has seen some bitter partisanship. 
While it will be remembered 
probably for the Republican obstructionism 
that has occurred, we can still 
look and find examples of significant 
bipartisan compromise. 

At a time when we see such interesting 
things around the country that 
need so much help, we have been able 
to pass legislation in one area of great 
concern: housing. We passed a comprehensive 
housing bill. The housing 
crisis has been uprooting families and 
wreaking havoc in neighborhoods 
across the country for far too long. It 
was a struggle to get this bill passed. 
Never in the history of the country, I 
am told, has there been a bill that has 
passed the Congress where we have had 
seven filibusters on one bill—the same 
bill—at the same time. We had one filibuster 
right after the other, seven of 
them, but we finally got to the finish 
line on housing. It is a good piece of 
legislation. Some 8,500 families who receive 
foreclosure notices every day will 
not be confronted with that in many 
instances because of the legislation we 
passed. 

During this work period, we also 
passed the Medicare doctors fix—the 
salvation of Medicare is what it was— 
and we did that by overriding the 
senseless veto by the President of the 
United States. We were only able to do 
that because right down here stood 
Senator TED KENNEDY, a man who 
should not have been here. He was not 
supposed to be flying. He wasn’t supposed 
to be around crowds, and of 
course there were lots of crowds that 


S8020 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

were here—everyone wanted to be 
around him—and he stood here and 
cast the deciding vote that broke the 
impasse. We had 60 votes. After we got 
60 votes, the Republicans in good will 
joined and allowed us to save Medicare. 
It took the courage of TED KENNEDY, 
rising from his sick bed against doctors’ 
orders, to cast the deciding vote. 
Because he did, and enough Republicans 
joined with us, we renewed the 
long-held American promise that the 
elderly, the disabled and the orphans 
and widows will receive the health care 
they need. 

We also passed, during this work period, 
a bill that is a test to America’s 
charity and moral authority in the 
world, the so-called PEPFAR bill. This 
legislation provides an unprecedented 
level of support for the fight against 
AIDS in Africa. It is not often I have 
occasion to praise the President, but he 
did a good job on this, and I commend 
him for helping us. I am glad that even 
after we had struggles for months at a 
time, Senate Republicans joined with 
the President and Senate Democrats to 
choose to end their obstruction and 
allow us to pass that legislation. 

Late yesterday, we wrapped up work 
on an important piece of legislation. 
We did it at the end of this work period. 
In fact, we did it on two important 
pieces of legislation: consumer 
product safety and the higher education 
bill, both very important pieces 
of legislation. At a time when parents 
are rightly more concerned than ever 
about the safety of the toys they buy 
for their children, the consumer product 
safety legislation gives parents and 
all consumers new assurance that the 
goods we buy are fully tested and approved 
for safe use. That applies to the 
stereotype, which is the toys the children 
use in America, but it is far 
broader than that. With rare exception, 
it is everything we consume in America 
today now will be safe. 

The Higher Education Act had not 
been reauthorized in some 10 years 
until last night. Of course, it was long 
overdue, but since we passed it, millions 
of bright young American minds 
will have the opportunity to unlock 
the doors of opportunity a college education 
provides. 

Our country will be stronger for 
every one of the bills we passed this 
work period—every one of them. I wish 
we had passed a lot more. Those we did 
are important. I am glad we did it. As 
with any legislation, when you pass a 
bill, there are lots of accolades to be 
passed around. When you don’t pass a 
bill, there is a lot of blame to go 
around. 

I feel a lot of disappointment, 
though, when I think back upon this 
work period and wonder what might 
have been, what might we have accomplished 
if our Republican colleagues 
had decided to dance with us more 
often than fight. We could have gone a 
long way toward solving America’s energy 
crisis. Yesterday was a microcosm 
for why the Senate failed to do so. 

Democrats came to the floor to offer 
seven different energy initiatives. Our 
plan would tackle every piece of the 
energy puzzle: Increasing supply with 
more domestic production, meaning increasing 
supply with more American 
production; reducing demand by investing 
in clean and renewable alternatives; 
going after those who keep oil 
prices artificially high for their own financial 
gain; and helping those in need 
pay their skyrocketing heating bills. 

Earlier today, a group of 10 Senators—
5 Republicans, 5 Democrats—indicated 
they had done some work to 
come up with a proposal that they 
think would help the energy crisis. I 
have been kept informed of how this 
has been progressing, and I am glad 
they have worked on what they did. 
They have worked very hard. There are 
many good ideas. Do I agree with everything 
they did? No, I don’t agree 
with everything, but even the 10 don’t 
agree with everything in the package. 

I look forward to working with them. 
We are going to work with this group 
in a number of different ways. First of 
all, the information we got from them 
is important. I am going to hold a summit 
in Las Vegas on August 19—an energy 
summit, a clean energy summit. 
President Clinton will be there, Mayor 
Bloomberg, T. Boone Pickens, the Governors 
of Utah, Arizona, Colorado. We 
have people from the private sector, 
the public sector coming to talk about 
what we can do to wean ourselves from 
fossil fuel. 

Also, the week we get back in September, 
we are going to have an energy 
summit of Democrats, a bipartisan energy 
summit, to see if there is any way 
we can work together to move for-
ward—move forward on things that are 
so important to this country, such as 
having multiple year energy tax credits 
so we can wean ourselves from the 
fossil fuels and look to the Sun, the 
wind, and geothermal for our energy. I 
certainly hope we can do that. 

Republicans have said no to every 
proposal we have made. Because they 
did, the American people will have to 
wait for short- and long-term solutions 
to the energy crisis. That truly is unfortunate. 


With more Republican cooperation, 
we could have passed mental health 
parity. That is so important. It is a bipartisan 
bill to ensure equal access to 
health care for people with mental illness. 
We were prevented from doing 
that. 

With more Republican cooperation, 
we could have passed a package of 13 
bipartisan bills that Republicans 
blocked. That package includes the 
Emmett Till unsolved crimes bill 
which would help heal old wounds and 
provide the Department of Justice and 
the FBI tools needed to effectively investigate 
and possibly solve civil 
rights-era murders. 

The Runaway and Homeless Youth 
Act would provide grants for health 
care, education and workforce programs 
and housing programs for runaway 
and homeless youth. 

The combating child exploitation bill 
would provide grants to train law enforcement 
to use technology to track 
individuals who trade in child pornography 
and establish an Internet crimes 
against children task force. 

The Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis 
Act would enhance cooperation 
in research, rehabilitation, and quality 
of life with people who suffer from paralysis. 


LIHEAP, a bill that was called Cool 
In Summer, Warm In Winter Act to 
provide relief to the aged, the disabled, 
and the poor so they can have energy 
assistance to cool their homes in summertime, 
heat their homes in the wintertime—
the Republicans turned it 
down. 

We were amazed that Republicans 
said no to these bills and many others, 
but they did, and that is unfortunate. 

The list of critical priorities we could 
have done something about with even a 
small degree of Republican cooperation 
is no longer available to us now. It 
would have been nice if we could have 
done the list. The list of things we 
copuld have done is far longer than I 
can recite today, but I say that because 
Republicans chose the path of obstruction. 
The good we did is far outweighed 
by the good that could have been. Of 
course, that is disappointing to all of 
us. 

When you strip away the differences 
between the McCain Republican approach 
to energy and the Democratic 
approach to high gas prices, you find 
the Republican policy is the Exxon policy, 
and our policy is an energy policy. 
The Republicans have a one-word policy: 
drill. That is the Exxon policy. Our 
approach, the Democratic approach is 
No. 1, drill where appropriate, but also 
develop competition for oil by encouraging 
solar, wind, geothermal. The Republicans 
say no because it will lower 
oil prices, and that is not what Exxon 
wants. Our policy is to increase the 
supply now by releasing oil from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Republicans 
say no because it will lower 
oil prices and that is not what Exxon 
wants. 

No. 3, we say go after financial speculators. 
The Republicans say no because 
that would lower the price of oil, and 
that is not what Exxon wants. 

No. 4, we say invest in new car battery 
technology. The Republicans say 
no because that will lower oil prices, 
and that is not what Exxon wants. 

The Republicans’ affection for Exxon 
explains why they say no to even allowing 
us to debate issues that are so 
important. No, no, no is what Exxon 
wants—to keep oil prices high. 

That is too bad. 

When we return in September, we 
need to get right back to work. We 
have just a few weeks to get a lot done. 
Perhaps by then, though, the political 
winds will blow in a different direction, 
and the Republicans will return with a 
new willingness to work together. If 
they do, we can work out a bipartisan 
plan on energy that meets our country’s 
near- and long-term needs. 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8021 

We can send the American people a 
new economic stimulus bill to help 
families make ends meet and strengthen 
an economy that has now lost jobs 
every month this year. 

We can pass the Defense authorization 
bill that provides our military 
with the funds they need to keep our 
country safe. It takes care of those who 
serve us bravely with an across-the-
board 3.9-percent military pay raise 
and major investments in the physical 
safety and mental health of our troops, 
not the least of which is attempting to 
rebuild the military which is in a state 
of distress because of the Iraq war. 

We can pass a Military Construction/ 
Veterans Affairs appropriations bill to 
maintain and upgrade military facilities, 
build better military family housing, 
and ensure the care our veterans 
deserve. 

We can pass a Defense appropriations 
bill to keep our Armed Forces prepared 
for combat and peacetime missions, relieve 
the strain of constant 12- and now 
15-month deployments, and support 
highly classified initiatives in the fight 
against terrorism. 

With the Presidential election drawing 
near, our time will be short. But 
with new cooperation from our Republican 
colleagues, we can do all this— 
and pass several other important bipartisan 
bills already passed by the House 
of Representatives. 

So I wish all my colleagues well in 
their August travels. I know we are all 
weary from the long, difficult work period. 


I also know the fights that await our 
return won’t be easy. I hope a month 
back home will give our Republican 
colleagues a new appreciation for how 
America needs badly the changes they 
have blocked. 

Our hands remain outstretched. Our 
eagerness to seek common ground remains 
as strong as ever. We will fight 
if we must, but we would much rather 
dance. 

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 

CROSSING OF THE NORTH POLE 

BY THE USS ‘‘NAUTILUS’’ 

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise 
today, joined by my colleagues Senators 
LIEBERMAN, REED, and 
WHITEHOUSE, to mark the 50th anniversary 
of a momentous occasion in our 
Nation’s maritime history, an occasion 
that truly launched the American 
Navy into the Nuclear Age. On August 
3, 1958, the USS Nautilus, the world’s 
first nuclear powered submarine, became 
the first vessel to travel under 
the North Pole. The intrepid crewmen 
of the Nautilus received a Presidential 
Unit Citation for their service, and Operation 
Sunshine, as it was called, provided 
a powerful boost to American 
morale following the Soviet launch of 
Sputnik. Today, we mark this important 
milestone with a resolution honoring 
the Nautilus’s historic feat. 

The USS Nautilus’s Arctic voyage 
was a remarkable feat of American 
naval engineering, demonstrating the 
evolution of submarines from slow underwater 
ships to warships that could 
submerge for many weeks and travel 
through varied depths and conditions, 
maintaining travel speeds of 20–25 
knots. Submarines, as was proven that 
day, would pursue unconventional 
courses to achieve incredible results, in 
this case, traveling a much shorter distance 
than was thought possible, to 
reach strategically important destinations 
on the other side of the globe. 

But most important, it marked a 
major milestone for our nuclear Navy, 
which would lead to other developments, 
such as submarines powered by 
single pressurized water reactors, and 
an aircraft carrier, USS Enterprise, 
powered by eight reactor units in 1960. 

While the Nautilus’s successful voyage 
was an inspiration to all America, 
it serves a particularly important 
point of pride to our submariners, as 
well as the engineers and shipbuilders 
of the Electric Boat Division of General 
Dynamics, who have built our Nation’s 
nuclear submarines in Connecticut 
for more than four decades. As 
a young boy, I attended the launch of 
the USS Nautilus in Groton, CT; and 
had the honor to witness my late 
mother christening the USS Stimson. 
My first cousin, Bill McAree, was one 
of the chosen few to serve in the nuclear 
submarine force under Admiral 
Rickover, and for 34 years, I have had 
the distinct pleasure of representing 
the home State of our Nation’s premier 
undersea warfare facilities, including 
Naval Submarine Base New London. 

As we commemorate the 50th anniversary 
of this important voyage, we 
must also look forward to the future of 
American naval power. As nations 
around the world continue to enlarge 

their own submarine fleets, the U.S. 
ability to travel freely and swiftly beneath 
the waves represents a critically 
important component of U.S. seapower. 
Today, our submarine fleet is contributing 
invaluable surveillance and reconnaissance 
to our warfighters, and 
providing an important platform for 
operations in what the Navy calls ‘‘the 
littorals,’’ or coastal areas. Our military 
has no more stealthy means for 
delivering power than the submarine, 
carrying Navy SEAL teams to enemy 
territory undetected, or traveling to 
specific locations to launch cruise missiles. 
Submarines are not merely weapons 
of war, they are tools of statecraft, 
providing critical intelligence to policymakers 
and serving as a critical deterrent 
to promote stability throughout 
the globe. And it is submarines’ 
demonstrated ability to traverse the 
world undetected, at any point in the 
ocean, even the North Pole, that makes 
the work of our silent service, our submariners, 
so critically important to 
our national security. 

As we look back on the first 50 years 
of America’s nuclear submarine program, 
the United States must be ready 
to continue the great legacy of the 
USS Nautilus, its crewmen, 
shipwrights, and designers, and remain 
in the forefront of submarine development.

COSPONSORSHIP—S. 3406 
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, through 
an oversight of our two offices we neglected 
to add Senator DOLE as an 
original cosponsor to this act when we 
introduced it last night. Senator DOLE 
is a leader on disability issues and 
should be commended for her and her 
husband’s commitment to individuals 
with disabilities. 
Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want 
to apologize to the Senator from North 
Carolina for this oversight. Our legislation, 
S. 3406, enjoys broad support 
among advocates for individuals with 
disabilities, and I want everyone in 
that community to know that Senator 
DOLE intended to be an original cosponsor 
of this measure. We look forward 
to working closely with her and 
the rest of our colleagues to pass this 
measure when the Senate reconvenes 
in September.

RETIREMENT OF GENERAL 
RICHARD A. CODY 

Mr. LEAHY. I rise to commend GEN 
Richard A. Cody, the Vice Chief of 
Staff of the Army, on his retirement. 
General Cody is one of the Nation’s finest 
military officers, and, with a career 
that spans over 36 years in the Army, 
he leaves behind a stronger, more experienced, 
and more professional fighting 
force. Vermont is proud to call General 
Cody a native, and there is little doubt 
that his time growing up in our State 
capital, Montpelier, instilled in him a 
deep sense of loyalty and public service. 



S8022 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

From the day of his commissioning 
to his last formal day in the service, 
General Cody made an indelible mark 
as an aviator, not just as an officer 
who could wield an Apache or 
Blackhawk with impressive precision 
and skill, but as a leader who inspired 
other aviators and maintainers to do 
their best. He competently led such 
prestigious and capable aviation units 
as the 160th Special Operations Regiment 
and the 101st Airborne Division. 
In the early stages of the first gulf war, 
he headed up one of the earliest and 
strategically critical aerial attacks, 
paving the way for subsequent air and 
ground forces. He amassed an impressive 
5,000 hours of flight time. 

It was that quality to inspire and to 
lead through example that elevated 
General Cody to the higher ranks of 
the U.S. Army. His service as the Vice 
Chief of Staff has coincided with ongoing 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and 
he has helped the Army restructure 
and reequip itself for that challenging 
undertaking. He has always been open 
about the Army’s needs, clearly informing 
the service’s civilian leaders, 
the media, and Congress about the 
tools necessary to carry out its missions. 
He has been involved in some 
vigorous debates in the Pentagon, out 
of which emerged sensible approaches 
to activation and equipping of the Reserves, 
including the National Guard. 
He always has in mind his view—built 
through that experience and knowledge—
of what is best for the Army and 
the country. He is an articulate 
spokesperson and fierce advocate. 

General Cody has always kept one 
foot in Vermont where his family has 
such strong roots, particularly around 
Montpelier where he was born and 
raised. Few in the State have not purchased 
a car at Cody Chevrolet, which 
is owned and operated by the General’s 
family. He and his lovely wife Vicki 
have two proud sons, Capt. Clint Cody 
and Capt. Tyler Cody, both Apache pilots 
in the Army. His immediate family 
has had the chance to spend considerable 
time in the State, experiencing 
the deep patriotism that runs through 
the Green Mountains and the Champlain 
Valley. It was only fitting that 
Norwich University, the Nation’s oldest 
military academy, recently honored 
General Cody. 

General Cody has been open about 
the challenges that the Army faces. His 
forthright manner is matched only by 
the quiet energy he brings to tackling 
problems aggressively. He is the model 
Army officer, a doer as much as a 
thinker, a loyalist as much as someone 
speaking straight. As he retires, I 
know there are many in the Army, officers 
and enlisted, who will continue to 
strive to replicate the path that he 
blazed with such dynamic energy. I 
know he will continue to be engaged 
with the Army, and, for that—and, 
above all, that incredible 36 years of 
service—Vermont and the whole United 
States are grateful. 

MEDICAL DEVICE SAFETY ACT 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am 
proud to join Senator KENNEDY and 
other Senators in the introduction of 
this legislation. The bill that we introduced 
yesterday will correct a decision 
of the Supreme Court that misconstrued 
the intent of Congress and 
cut off access to our Nation’s courts for 
citizens injured or killed by defective 
medical devices. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee 
held a hearing on June 11 to examine 
the way in which the Supreme Court’s 
decisions in the areas of retirement 
benefits and consumer product safety 
have consistently trended against the 
rights of consumers and in favor of big 
business. In many cases that have profound 
effects on the lives of ordinary 
Americans, the Court has either ignored 
the intent of Congress, or sided 
with a Federal agency’s flawed interpretation 
of a congressional statute’s 
preemptive froce to disadvantage consumers. 
It is regrettable that an anonymous 
Republican Senator objected on procedural 
grounds to the committee completing 
that hearing. And it is disappointing 
that the same party that 
engages in so much partisan rhetoric 
complaining about activist judges refuses 
to hear about the judicial activism 
when it comes from the judges 
whose activism they embrace as sound 
judicial philosophy. The impact of the 
decisions that were the focus of that 
hearing are being felt by Americans 
today, whether they are prohibited 
from seeking redress in the courts for 
an injury caused by a defective product, 
or left without remedies to enforce 
rights granted by Congress relating to 
nondiscrimination, or retirement and 
health care benefits. 
The bill we introduce today is an important 
step to correcting the Supreme 
Court’s erroneous reading of Congress’ 
intent in enacting the medical device 
amendments of 1976. Where the Court 
reaches to the extent it did in the 
Riegel decision to find Federal preemption 
contrary to what Congress intended, 
Congress is compelled to act. 
This legislation will make explicit that 
the preemption clause in the medical 
device amendments that the Court relied 
upon does not, and never was intended 
to preempt the common law 
claims of consumers injured by a federally 
approved medical device. 
As I noted in the Judiciary Committee’s 
recent hearing, many of the 
Court’s decisions that have the most 
far reaching impact on Americans’ wallets, 
retirement and health benefits, or 
access to justice, are the least publicized. 
But Americans should be deeply 
concerned when decisions of the Supreme 
Court override the policy judgments 
made by their elected representatives 
in Congress and negatively affect 
their day-to-day lives in significant 
ways. The extraordinary power to 
preempt State law and regulation lies 
with Congress alone. And as the Supreme 
Court has said on many occa


sions, the fundamental inquiry into 
whether a Federal statute preempts 
State law is the intent of Congress. I 
hope the introduction of this legislation 
sends the strong signal that some 
Senators intend to hold the Court to 
its own often-repeated pronouncements 
about this important principle.

THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINIS


TRATION EMPLOYEE RETENTION 

ACT 

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was 
pleased to join Senator LAUTENBERG 
yesterday in introducing S. 3416, The 
Federal Aviation Administration Employee 
Retention Act. I am supporting 
Senator LAUTENBERG in his efforts to 
correct what I believe is a very unfair 
process imposed upon employees of the 
Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, 
by Congress. 

Essentially, S. 3416 will correct the 
collective bargaining process Congress 
established for FAA employees in the 
FAA Reauthorization Act of 1996—Public 
Law 104–264—in which we inserted 
ourselves as arbitrators in labor disputes. 
Under the 1996 act, if the FAA 
and the union with whom they are in 
negotiation can not reach an agreement, 
then Congress has 60 days to intervene 
and if we do not, the FAA is 
able to impose its terms on the employees. 
Mr. President, this is not fair, 
it has not worked and it is time that 
we correct it. 

In addition to the widely published 
dispute between the FAA and the National 
Air Traffic Controllers Association, 
NATCA, the Professional Aviation 
Safety Specialists, PASS, also 
have been unable to negotiate a new 
contract with the FAA. Furthermore, 
in my State of Oklahoma, there has 
been an 8-year disagreement between 
the FAA and the FAA Academy Instructors 
represented by the Professional 
Association of Aeronautical Center 
Employees, PAACE. It is my understanding 
from PAACE that FAA has 
basically refused to come to the bargaining 
table, which has resulted in 
year to year extensions of an 8-year-old 
contract. This is not right. 

The very reasonable procedure established 
by S. 3416 will provide both sides 
in a labor dispute with a means to resolve 
disagreements by allowing FAA 
employees the same collective bargaining 
protections that employees 
covered under the National Labor Relations 
Board currently have. The bill 
provides the option of resolving disputes 
through the Federal Mediation 
and Conciliation Service or through 
mutual agreement on an alternative 
procedure. If no agreement is reached, 
then matters of disagreements will be 
presented to the Federal Services Impasses 
Panel for binding arbitration. 

Finally, the bill would require both 
sides go back to the negotiating table 
for any ‘‘personnel management system 
implemented’’ by the FAA Administrator 
on or after July 10, 2005. In 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8023 

other words, contract negotiations between 
FAA, NATCA and PASS are restarted 
with a 45-day deadline. If no 
agreement is reached, then there is an 
additional 90 days for binding arbitration. 


As a pilot I am well acquainted with 
the exceptional work done by the employees 
of the FAA and I know firsthand 
that our aviation system is only 
as good as these employees. They deserve 
the right to bargain in good faith 
on their employment contracts. This 
bill will give them that opportunity. 

Thank you, Senator LAUTENBERG, for 
introducing this bill, and I hope we get 
an opportunity to debate it very soon.

REMEMBERING SENATOR JESSE 
HELMS 

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I join with 
my colleagues in the Senate and the 
House, and with the people whose lives 
he touched all across the Nation, in 
saying how sorry I was to learn of the 
passing of Jesse Helms on July 4. He 
was a remarkable man, and he has left 
his mark on the United States that he 
loved so very much and the State of 
North Carolina that he served with 
great pride. He will not be forgotten. 

Jesse Helms was an American in 
every sense of the word—one who was 
firmly and staunchly dedicated to the 
principles upon which our country was 
founded. Those principles guided him 
through his life and helped him to 
make every difficult decision that confronted 
him in his 86 years of life. 

Jesse Helms was an established force 
in the Senate by the time I arrived. As 
a freshman Senator I knew I had a lot 
to learn and I was able to learn a lot 
from him as we served together and 
worked on several issues that meant a 
great deal to us both. We didn’t always 
agree, but I always found him to be a 
man of his word who said what he 
meant and meant what he said. You always 
knew where you stood with him 
and when he said ‘‘Yes’’ you knew that 
you could count on him to do what he 
said he would. 

Many of us come to Washington hoping 
to change Washington. Then, with 
the passage of time, we find that instead 
of changing Washington, Washington 
has changed us. How we are 
changed says a lot about us and our 
commitment to the principles and values 
that motivated us to run for the 
Senate in the first place. 

That kind of change is only natural 
and, for many of us, the changes that 
occur help us to see other viewpoints 
and perspectives and make it possible 
for us to work with Members on both 
sides of the aisle so we can achieve 
common goals and work for the best interests 
of the United States and the 
American people. 

Like so many of us, Jesse Helms was 
changed by his experience in the Senate. 
One of the most notable examples 
was the President’s foreign AIDS relief 
package we worked on together. 

For years Jesse was opposed to providing 
any assistance to countries 

fighting the AIDS epidemic. Some 
thought he would always oppose any 
kind of relief. Then, Bono, who is a 
powerful advocate for the cause, made 
an appointment to see Jesse Helms so 
he could share the human side of the 
problem with him. 

I guess no one had been able to put a 
human face on the AIDS epidemic for 
him before. However Bono was able to 
do it, he was able to touch Jesse’s 
heart and convince him that the need 
was real—and the right thing to do. In 
response, Jesse was big enough to 
admit that he had been wrong. After 
Bono’s presentation, Jesse decided to 
work on a proposal that would provide 
the needed funds to fight AIDS in Africa. 
The proposal was passed and signed 
into law, and thanks in part to his support, 
countless lives were saved. It is 
no coincidence that the reauthorization 
of this legislation that he worked 
so hard to pass was recently enacted 
into law by President Bush. It is a part 
of his legacy that will continue on 
after him and make a difference all 
over the world for many years to come. 

That is but one facet of his character, 
and one we are all familiar with. 
And, now that he has been taken from 
us, we will all take with us many more 
memories that come from our service 
with Jesse Helms in the Senate. 

A lot of what we remember about 
Jesse Helms and his service in the Senate 
would surprise those who only 
knew him by reputation because people 
thought he was a tough guy. But when 
you met him, you quickly came to see 
that he was a friendly person. He enjoyed 
greeting the tourists he met in 
the Halls and he made them all feel 
welcome because he always had a kind 
word for everyone he met. Those who 
worked here in the Capitol liked him 
because he treated them all with kindness 
and respect. 

At the top of Jesse’s list were those 
who work with us to help the House 
and Senate function as it should—especially 
the pages. I don’t think Jesse 
Helms ever missed a chance to say 
‘‘Thank you!’’ to the pages for their 
service to the Congress. That was just 
one of the ways that Jesse honored the 
Senate’s traditions and respected the 
office he was elected to hold. 

I remember a story he told me about 
his first Senate race. The campaign 
was in full swing, but Jesse’s numbers 
didn’t look too good. Then one day he 
ran into a fellow Mason who handed 
him a Masonic lapel pin. ‘‘Here,’’ he 
said. ‘‘Wear this during your campaign 
and I guarantee you that you will 
win.’’ 

He took his friend’s advice and wore 
the pin every day. Then, when the 
votes were counted, Jesse was the 
newly elected Senator from North 
Carolina. 

He told me that story while we were 
in the cloakroom and I was watching 
him put a new back on the pin that 
now showed a lot of use. I told him that 
I was a Mason, too. As he put the pin 
back on his lapel, he told me that he 

had worn that pin every day since his 
friend gave it to him during that first 
Senate campaign. 

As I came to know him, I saw that 
Jesse and I shared a great fondness and 
appreciation for the youth organizations 
that are recognized by the Congress. 
He knew that they were teaching 
our kids things they weren’t going to 
be getting any other way. He knew 
that these groups were helping our kids 
learn how to be good citizens and good 
students and to stand up for the things 
they believed in. He knew that they 
were helping to prepare our young people 
for the challenges they would face 
in school and later, in life. 

One organization we both worked to 
support was the Boy Scouts. He was a 
strong supporter of Scouting and he 
stood up for them whenever they were 
unfairly criticized or attacked. His response 
to each attack was to craft a 
bill that protected the promotion of 
volunteerism, values and faith to ensure 
those valuable lessons would continue 
to be taught to the Scouts. 

That is just one example of Jesse’s 
commitment to the values that meant 
so very much to him. That is why he 
was able to get a lot of things done 
over the years. His success was based 
on his strong foundation of values and 
beliefs that he would stand fast on and 
that was enough for him to win on 
most occasions. Watching him in action 
on the floor or in committee 
taught me that conviction counts, especially 
when you are firm and comfortable 
in what you believe. 

Jesse was a kind, soft spoken, effective, 
persistent and successful individual. 
He paid attention to people and 
they responded to him—in North Carolina 
and across the country. Another of 
his great political secrets was his understanding 
that a problem always appears 
bigger if it is your own. That’s 
why the people of his State sent him 
back to the Senate for five terms. He 
listened to the people of North Carolina, 
he understood them, and he made 
their problems his own. 

Now that the last chapter of his life 
has been written, Jesse Helms’ record 
speaks for itself. It reflects the fact 
that he was never concerned with being 
popular or taking positions because 
they mirrored the results of the latest 
poll. His focus was always on doing 
what was right—because it was the 
right thing to do. I think he owes his 
perspective on life to some advice his 
father gave him that helped to shape 
his character and point him toward his 
destiny. Jesse would often share his father’s 
words with others, ‘‘The Lord 
does not require you to win, but he 
does require you to try.’’ 

Jesse never forgot what his father 
told him. In fact, he lived those words 
by putting them into practice every 
day. No matter the odds or how impossible 
the situation was, Jesse stayed 
true to the life lesson his father taught 
him many years ago. 

Now that he has been taken from us, 
it will be for others to judge his place 


S8024 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

in history and the impact his life had 
on the Nation. Whatever is decided, for 
me and for so many others, the record 
will show that Jesse Helms didn’t always 
win, but he never let the fear of 
losing keep him from fighting for a 
cause he believed in. For Jesse Helms, 
the glory came not from victory, but 
from giving all he had in a noble effort 
in support of a worthy cause.

IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH 
ENERGY PRICES 

Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-
June, I asked Idahoans to share with 
me how high energy prices are affecting 
their lives, and they responded by 
the hundreds. The stories, numbering 
over 1,000, are heartbreaking and 
touching. To respect their efforts, I am 
submitting every e-mail sent to me 
through energy_prices@crapo.senate. 
gov to the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
This is not an issue that will be easily 
resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate 
and serious attention, and Idahoans 
deserve to be heard. Their stories 
not only detail their struggles to 
meet everyday expenses, but also have 
suggestions and recommendations as to 
what Congress can do now to tackle 
this problem and find solutions that 
last beyond today. I ask unanimous 
consent to have today’s letters printed 
in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 

I am a firm believer that Americans need 
to find alternatives to foreign oil and reliance 
on fossil fuels. But, instead of more domestic 
production, I believe Americans need 
to diversify in their approach, and not simply 
rely on alternative places to find oil and 
fossil fuels. Instead, the focus should be upon 
ingenuity, for example instead of water producing 
electricity, why not windmills, or 
wind energy? I grew up seeing fields of windmills 
on drives from Los Angeles to Palm 
Springs. Also, Boise is one of the most bicycle 
friendly cities, although you’d never 
know it by commuting on our poor streets 
that have completely ineffective bicycle 
commuting lanes. Instead of oil and gasoline, 
encourage people to bike to work by offering 
an expanded commuter tax credit. And, we 
have absolutely NO public transportation 
system. Why not focus on a systematic expansion 
of public transportation? As for 
home electricity and the like, why not an expanded 
tax credit on ‘‘going green?’’ I 
learned about the energy certification for 
your home when my family was building our 
new house, but it costs almost $3,000 to get 
your home tested to qualify for the tax credit, 
which is not worth it. Plus, energy efficient 
appliances and technology generally 
costs more. Why isn’t such technology more 
cost effective? Why are we not encouraged to 
do more? If green technology costs more, in 
order to encourage its use and mainstream 
applications, there has to be financial encouragement 
to install it in order to offset 
the high up-front costs. 

As for transportation, this summer, I cannot 
afford to buy a new car, even though I 
am a solid middle class citizen. Food prices 
have skyrocketed for my family, I have to 
pay for daycare for the summer, and I own a 
10-year-old gas guzzling SUV, which is probably 
not worth much on a trade in anymore 
what with the high gas prices. But I live only 

2 miles from work. The lack of public transportation 
has forced me to consider a different 
alternative, and that is biking to 
work. I am lucky because my employer (the 
federal government, by the way) is required 
to provide lockers and shower facilities on 
site, so I can bike in, shower, and go to work. 
I have encouraged my children to join me, 
and they are biking with me to summer 
camp as well. Unfortunately, this is the first 
summer I have been able to do this, because 
transporting my children to daycare was just 
about impossible without a car before this. 
Yet, most other nations have alternative 
transportation, and a totally different day 
care system, and because cycling is the norm 
it is much safer. I think the problem is deeper 
than just gas or oil prices. It is our own 
selfishness that has gotten us here, because 
we have never been forced to consider the alternatives. 


I hope that a comprehensive approach to 
this problem will be focused on, instead of 
just a quick financial fix for segments of the 
population. It is hurting us all. And until 
Congress and our nation focuses on the more 
widespread issues, our approach to everyday 
life won’t change. Because it is not just energy 
costs . . . it is more than that, and God 
forbid Congress forgets about the other problems, 
such as health care, child care, education, 
affordable housing, and the lack of 
appropriate services for those that are now 
falling behind because wages cannot keep up. 

KIRSTEN. 

As a kid, Congress said they were solving 
an ‘energy-crisis,’ and by the time I could 
drive, cars would get 100 mpg, jet-packs 
would be available by 1975, there would be a 
resort at ‘‘LunaCity’’ on the Moon by 1980, 
Mars by 1990, and Alpha Centauri by 2000. 

Today, Congress says they are ‘solving’ an 
‘energy-crisis,’ and if I just ‘believe’ in them, 
I will be ‘delivered’ from the valleys of shadows 
and death. 

Please note, Mr. Karzai’s diversion of 
cross-border Pakistani Talibani ‘marauding-
hoards,’ and the House of Saud’s past-due 
promises to pump more oil, while Congress 
spins their wheels-in-wheels-in-wheels of deceptions, 
is not ‘solving’ anything. Use of 
strategic reserves at this critical juncture is 
probably not a wise move, although I wish 
for the Clinton days of $0.89 cent/gal diesel. 
Your entire branch of government is completely 
out of control. THAT is the solution. 

CLAYTON, Priest River. 

I have 4 teenage boys that are big and are 
growing fast. The increased energy costs 
have significantly increased the cost of almost 
all goods. Most noticeably, our food bill 
has nearly doubled since the first of the 
year. We are desperately looking for any 
means to economize. 

Although I am able to ride my bike to 
work and have taken several steps to minimize 
our fuel bills, we are feeling the crunch 
of increased petroleum costs. We have aging 
parents that are in need of more of our attention. 
Unfortunately, our parents are over 
400 miles away, so it costs us over $180 dollars 
to make the trip to see them and to try 
to help them take care of their homes and 
properties. 

It makes sense to me that the rising cost 
of fuel would affect our economy. My salary 
is not increasing, and with the cost of goods 
and fuel increasing, we are only able to make 
ends meet by not buying other things. This 
trend would seem to hurt other businesses 
that are depending on people like me to be 
buying their goods. 

I am an Electrical Engineer and I am very 
disturbed over the push to skip nuclear 
power and move solely to renewable energy. 
The wind and solar power options available 

today will not meet our energy needs. Unfortunately, 
our country was behind in providing 
the needed supply of energy when the 
recent acceleration in energy costs began. I 
do believe that renewable technologies like 
wind and solar can play an important role in 
meeting future energy needs, but I think we 
need to provide a plan that sees these technologies 
mature and become less expensive 
through manufacturing advances. I believe 
we need to develop nuclear and clean-burning 
coal as stop-gap measures to allow the 
renewable technologies to advance to the 
point where they are more cost effective. If 
we try to move strictly to renewable energy 
sources, I am concerned that we will face energy 
shortages, or will further reduce consumer 
spending power by having to put our 
money in the more expensive renewable energy 
sources. 

GENE. 

This is one subject I completely agree with 
you on. The U.S. Congress has to act to allow 
drilling where we know we have oil reserves. 
The stupidest statement I have ever heard 
from Congress, which I have recently heard 
repeatedly, is that we cannot solve our energy 
crisis by drilling. That is about like 
saying we cannot solve a food shortage by 
planting more crops! 

Last month I spent over $760 on gasoline 
and my wife spent several hundred [dollars] 
also. We do not have the option of using public 
transportation and we need larger vehicles 
on our farms. As a farmer, while currently 
enjoying good prices, we are seeing a 
big chunk of the increased income eaten up 
in fuel costs. If crop prices were to return to 
‘‘normal’’ levels, it would devastate Idaho 
farms. Thanks for your help on this important 
issue. 

KEITH, Blackfoot. 

Honestly, I do not want to tell a story 
about how I am affected by high energy 
prices—it is obvious. I think the last thing 
we need is to talk about it more. The ways 
to lower prices are out there and the Congress 
knows it. Just get it done. Just as communism 
caused us to fight with all our 
American might at home and around the 
world to preserve our nation, so also must we 
view our nation’s energy as a cause worth 
pursuing with all our sweat and synapses. If 
not, our nation will lose the strength, the 
hope, the dream that has raised so many 
generations of Americans before. 

Please, please do not talk anymore. Do 
something. You should receive many reply 
emails. Several will have great ideas (wind, 
solar, hydrogen, nuclear, oil). Pick the ideas 
with the most promise and encourage their 
production and then stay out of those 
geniuses’ way and watch what the American 
people can do. 

JOSH, Idaho Falls. 

Too many people have this backwards. 
Most agree there is a limited amount of oil 
we can get. We need to save our reserves and 
use up the foreign oil first. Then when the 
foreign oil is nearly used up we will still 
have some to aid in the transition to other 
sources or energy. Save our oil and use up 
foreign oil first. 

The last one standing with some oil wins. 

CARL. 

I am an Idaho Farmer. I have been deeply 
concerned about the prices of fuel in Idaho. 
The price of fuel has affected the cost of almost 
every aspect of farming from fertilizer 
to chemicals, tires, etc. The list goes on and 
on. The price of labor has all gone up because 
people cannot afford to work for less. My 
generation might be the last generation of 
farmers in Idaho. I personally have two sons 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8025 

and have encouraged them to find another 
way to make a living because the cost of 
starting up and the cost of farming are too 
prohibitive. There is no way that they can 
make it with the price of fuels. I guess my 
story is that the family farm is on its way 
out of Idaho. The families of America hold 
this nation together. If you break up the 
family, the United States will break as well. 
I guess the only way to get Congress to do 
anything is to wait for their stomachs to 
growl. Otherwise, if you eat you are involved 
in farming. No farms—no food! 

LORN. 

First, thank you for some leadership on 
this issue. I will be brief. My family and I 
just completed an auto trip to Montana and 
back. Fuel costs were averaging $4.05/gallon 
of regular. The costs of travel will have a 
significant effect on my family’s recreation 
this year. We also have a small airplane and 
AV gas is now $6.30 in our area meaning it 
now costs $63.00 per hour just in fuel costs to 
fly the airplane my family and I have enjoyed 
for years. Unfortunately at these 
prices our boating costs have risen considerably. 
Grocery costs have risen. Freight costs 
are going up along with the airfares for the 
airlines. The selling price for my airplane 
and boat if I were to sell them are going 
down. Many families are selling their RVs 
because they just cannot afford to recreate 
like they used to. 

Finally I have just retired after 31 years in 
my company. I have a small pension and 
have had to cut drastically on my anticipated 
lifestyle already. I had planned to 
teach flying lessons as a part-time job but 
the marketability of flight instruction may 
very well be priced out of the range of many 
prospective students. 

I feel that the government and Congress 
have had since 1972 to get a grip on this problem 
and have done nothing except band-aid 
and pass the buck. We need to get real, drill 
whenever and wherever we need to immediately 
and reverse our current bad policy on 
nuclear energy. We cannot remain forever relying 
on petroleum but we need cogent policies 
to help us get to the next best thing for 
our energy needs. 

We also need to put a cap on the speculating 
by the commodity traders that are 
driving up the prices daily. And, although I 
hate to say it, maybe we need to regulate a 
few more of those items that affect us working 
people so much on a daily basis, like utilities, 
phone service, cable costs and fuel. 

MIKE, Pocatello. 

Thank you for providing this forum to express 
my views about energy prices in our 
fine state, their impact, and solutions. I unequivocally 
believe that our present asset-
depleting condition is a direct result of 30-
plus years of disastrous, foolhardy legislation 
from Congress that has made it impossible 
for America’s brilliant innovators to 
make us energy independent. Yes, the price 
of gas is leading my family to really think 
about every trip in the car, but I do not want 
a band-aid government solution to replace 
the free market. The following is what I believe 
is critical to our national security, as 
well as comfort at the pump: 

(1) Deregulate and allow drilling in all its 
forms everywhere, right now! Admit to decades 
of failed, self-destructive policy and 
move on. 
(2) Encourage, through generous incentives, 
the building of refineries everywhere, 
right now! 
(3) Remove all legislative obstacles to the 
building of nuclear plants and encourage, 
through generous incentives, their construction 
everywhere, right now! 
Senator, what is frightening and of tremendous 
concern for myself and many citi


zens, perhaps yourself as well, is our global 
competitors, friend and foe alike, are rapidly 
growing and tapping into their own energy 
sources, nuclear and petroleum, and America 
has become weak and dependent. It is sickening 
and dangerous. This must be reversed, 
immediately! Congress needs to remember 
that American interests, both short and 
long-term, must at all times be placed above 
those of other countries or the so-called 
‘‘international community.’’ There is no one 
else on the globe looking out for us. Senator, 
you need to do it. Thank you for your excellent 
work on behalf of your constituents. 

MICHAEL, Post Falls. 

My husband and I live in the country outside 
of Rexburg and have to drive almost ten 
miles to get to town. My husband is a full-
time college student and works part-time. I 
also have a part-time job and it is a struggle 
to fill up our gas tanks every few weeks. Gas 
prices are shooting up but our incomes are as 
small as ever. 

My father is a farmer and has tractors, 
trucks, and other machinery to fuel. He has 
no choice. He needs those machines to do his 
work, but it is just so expensive. 

Something needs to be done about the cost 
of fuel and energy and it needs to be done 
now! We need to stop relying on other countries 
to fuel our cars. We need to start using 
more alternative fuel and energy sources. We 
have the means but do we have the motivation? 
I hope so. 

REGENCY, Rexburg. 

You are correct regarding the adverse affect 
that the rising cost of fuel has on the 
lives of all Americans including the citizens 
of Idaho. 

We must drill for oil on American soil and 
pump from the wells we have capped, mine 
clean coal in Utah and elsewhere, use wind 
for energy where it pays, create more fuel efficient 
engines, engineer better batteries for 
electric cars, make affordable solar power 
options available where possible . . . and 
thank God for the clean source of power we 
get from our hydro-electric dams. 

We are a nation that was blessed by God 
with an abundance of natural resources. 
However, if we don’t develop them and use 
what we have been provided with, and yet 
continue to complain, we are fools. 

The cost of fuel is showing its effect on our 
small business in that orders are down and 
costs are up. It now costs double what it did 
two years ago to get to and from work, purchase 
some of our materials, and pick up 
those materials from our suppliers. We have 
tried not to pass the rising cost of shipping 
on to our customers as it is already high and 
keeps some people from purchasing our product. 
Therefore, we take a cut in our normal 
profit and that means less money in our 
pockets to spend on other products and services 
that we would like to have and use locally. 


I work in town and there is absolutely no 
public transportation available in this area. 
It is a small town in the mountains of Idaho 
and I drive seven miles each way to work 
every day. Many workers must drive ten to 
twenty miles each way and it is eating into 
their family budgets. Now the price of fuel is 
taking its toll on food costs. Prices are getting 
ridiculously high and I cannot imagine 
trying to feed a family these days. I believe 
in less government. But there is something 
wrong with these high fuel costs; they are 
unjustified and the government does need to 
get to the bottom of it and put a stop to it 
now. 

The last thing that should be done is to put 
a higher tax on our fuel and energy costs. 
The people who suffer the most from this 
problem are our elderly population (and dis


abled) who are on fixed incomes. Now they 
must choose whether to fill the oil tank (pay 
the electric bill) or to eat . . . we have gone 
sadly astray from the United States of 
America in which I grew up, and we had better 
get back to our roots of belief and our 
Constitution. 

I believe in helping others and it is a fact 
that Americans are the most generous citizens 
on earth, giving to others even in other 
nations freely on a regular basis; no nation 
on earth gives more. However, as a country 
we must stop sending money to other countries 
in the world that have problems or disasters 
and start taking care of our own problems, 
infrastructure, and disasters. I do not 
believe in socialism, but we should provide 
for our elderly who provided for us. I am sick 
of seeing our government pledge billions of 
dollars of taxpayer money to countries that 
hate us. It is wrong and foolish. . . . 

We have got a mess on our hands. Our Congress 
and Senate need to stand up for what is 
right . . . and protect and defend the U.S. 
Constitution as they swore to do. Quit being 
swayed by interest groups, and money. Stand 
for what is good for our Country not what is 
good for their pocketbook. We need some 
men and women with character and honor 
. . . I hope you will be a man of character 
and honor and serve this nation as is needed. 
May God bless and help you in this fight. 

MRS. KENNETH.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 

90TH BIRTHDAY OF MAURY 
ALBERTSON 

S Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I 
honor Colorado State University professor 
Maury Albertson in recognition 
of his 90th birthday on August 30, 2008. 

Dr. Albertson has distinguished himself 
in countless ways throughout his 
extensive and renowned career. He has 
been a devout champion of civic responsibility, 
a selfless servant to others, 
and a man who has changed lives 
worldwide through his compassion and 
understanding of other peoples and cultures. 


As a young professor in 1960, Dr. Albertson 
and his team of scholars and 
students won a contract to study the 
option and assess the likelihood of creating 
an International Youth Corps, 
which laid the groundwork for the creation 
of the Peace Corps. He later went 
on to coauthor ‘‘New Frontiers for 
American Youth’’ that put forth the 
basic design for the Peace Corps. 

Throughout his many years as a consultant 
for the World Bank, the United 
Nations Development Program, the 
Agency for International Development, 
and others, Dr. Albertson organized 
and advanced innovative projects involving 
sanitation, water resource development, 
village development, small 
industry development, and research 
and education. 

A true believer in the philosophy of 
local empowerment, Dr. Albertson 
founded and currently serves as president 
of Village Earth, an international 
organization that has trained villages 
and NGOs in 15 countries in the methods 
of sustainable village development. 
Remarkably, in 1993, Dr. Albertson 


S8026 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

convened an international conference 
on sustainable village development, attended 
by over 350 people from 34 countries. 
It was an extraordinary success. 

In May, 2006, Colorado State University 
awarded Dr. Albertson an honorary 
Doctor of Humane Letters in recognition 
of his exceptional contributions 
to industry and developing nations. 
This was a well-deserved honorary 
degree for Dr. Albertson. 

Mr. President, I am proud the Senate 
has recognized the many accomplishments 
of Dr. Maury Albertson, a distinguished 
professor and true humanitarian.

HONORING MOUNTAIN HOME AIR 

FORCE BASE 
S Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to recognize the outstanding 
accomplishments of the 366th Fighter 
Wing at Mountain Home Air Force 
Base in my home State of Idaho. The 
Gunfighters at Mountain Home earned 
the Air Force Meritorious Unit Award 
for the 17-month period from January 
1, 2007, to May 31, 2008. The award is 
presented to active duty, Reserve and 
Guard units for exceptionally meritorious 
conduct in several areas, including 
outstanding services for at 
least three months during military operations 
against an armed enemy, outstanding 
devotion to duty and superior 
performance of exceptionally difficult 
tasks setting them apart from other 
units with similar missions. This 
award was established following September 
11. 

According to the 366th Fighter Wing 
Commander, COL James S. Browne, 
the Gunfighters earned this prestigious 
honor for exceptional conduct in direct 
support of combat operations in Iraq 
and Afghanistan, which include the 
historical deployment of Mountain 
Home AFB’s F–15E Strike Eagles to 
Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan, as well 
as its direct support of 600 close air 
support missions over the Iraq. I offer 
my congratulations to all members of 
the 366th, and commend them on a job 
that continues to be extremely well 
done. Idaho is very proud of her Air 
Force personnel, and remains honored 
to be the host of these men and women 
who make Idaho home during their 
military service. The Gunfighters’ outstanding 
accomplishments in earning 
this reward reflect well on them, their 
units, their families and their adopted 
state. This award demonstrates, yet 
again, the outstanding commitment 
that our Mountain Home Air Force 
Base airmen have to their mission, 
their excellence in support and execution 
of the strategic goals of our military 
mission overseas and their unwavering 
defense of our Nation.S

TRIBUTE TO RETIRED BRIGADIER 

GENERAL KENNETH M. TAYLOR 
S Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, all of us 
know what happened at Pearl Harbor 
on December 7, 1941. We have seen and 

read about the brave men and women 
who fought that day. Today, I rise to 
pay special tribute to one of those men, 
Kenneth M. Taylor a retired U.S. Air 
Force brigadier general, a fighter pilot, 
war hero, and, of course, a Sooner. 

Seventy years ago, Ken Taylor graduated 
from high school in Hominy, OK, 
and entered the University of Oklahoma, 
as a pre-law student. Like many 
college students in 1938, he was enjoying 
life with his fraternity brothers but 
could not avoid thinking about what 
was happening in Europe, the South 
Pacific and Asia. He believed America 
would be going to war in the next year 
or two and wanted his first choice 
should his country go to war. He joined 
the Army Air Corps in 1940 and graduated 
from the U.S. Army Air Corps 
Training Center at Brooks Field near 
San Antonio, TX, on April 25, 1941. Second 
Lieutenant Taylor requested to fly 
fighters and, in June 1941, he was assigned 
to the 47th Pursuit Squadron at 
Wheeler Army Airfield in Honolulu, HI. 

After arriving at Wheeler Field, 
Lieutenant Taylor met another pilot, 
George Welch, from Wilmington, DE, 
and they became close friends. Taylor 
and Welch were both assigned to fly 
the Curtiss P–40B Warhawk, a single-
engine, single-seat, fighter and ground 
attack aircraft. On the ground, they 
were seen as goof-offs and a nuisance to 
West Pointers. However, the commander 
of the 47th Pursuit Squadron, 
Captain Gordon Austin, said he immediately 
recognized their extraordinary 
skills as pilots and made them flight 
leads. 

About 3 a.m. on December 7, Taylor 
and Welch were just returning from 
their Saturday evening on the town. 
Just before 8 a.m., Taylor was awakened 
by low-flying planes and explosions. 
He jumped out of bed, quickly 
put on his tuxedo pants from the night 
before, and ran into the street to see 
Japanese planes firing and dropping 
bombs on the base. He called Haleiwa 
Auxiliary air field where 18 P–40B 
fighters were located and, without orders, 
he told the ground crews to get 
two P–40 fighters armed and ready for 
takeoff. Enroute to Haleiwa, Taylor 
and Welsh were strafed by Japanese 
aircraft as they made their 10 mile trek 
to Haleiwa in Taylor’s new Buick. At 
the airstrip, they climbed into their 
Curtiss P–40B Warhawk fighters and 
headed towards Barber’s Point at the 
southwest tip of Oahu. Unfortunately, 
the aircraft only had .30-caliber gunnery 
practice ammo. 

Initially, Taylor and Welsh saw an 
unarmed group of American B–17 Flying 
Fortress bombers who were arriving 
from the mainland but then spotted 
twelve Japanese torpedo dive bombers 
near Ewa Mooring Mast Field, a Marine 
base near Pearl Harbor. Lieutenant 
Taylor shot down two dive bombers 
and was able to damage another before 
running out of ammunition and returned 
with Welsh to Wheeler Field to 
rearm with .50-caliber bullets. On the 
ground at Wheeler, several senior offi


cers climbed up on the wings of their 
aircraft and told them to disperse their 
aircraft and do not go up again. Luckily, 
as Lieutenant Taylor explained 
later, a second wave of Japanese aircraft 
flew over and ‘‘the brass’’ ran for 
safety. With fuel and ammo, Taylor 
and Welsh took to the air again 
straight into the wave of Japanese aircraft 
attacking Wheeler Field. 

As Taylor headed for a group of Japanese 
aircraft, he found himself in the 
middle of a line of Japanese planes. A 
bullet from a plane behind him came 
through his canopy about an inch from 
his head, hit the trim tab, went though 
his left arm and exploded. One piece of 
shrapnel went through his left arm and 
another piece went into his leg, ruining 
his tux pants. Taylor reflected on the 
injuries in a 2001 interview, saying ‘‘It 
was of no consequence; it just scared 
the hell out of me for a minute.’’ A few 
years after the interview, he received 
two slugs from his crew chief that had 
been found behind his seat. Welch saw 
Taylor’s predicament and shot down 
the plane on his friend’s tail, likely 
saving his life. Both pilots continued 
their aerial combat until they had 
chased the Japanese planes off the 
north shore and again were out of ammunition. 


Fourteen different American pilots 
were able to take off during the surprise 
attack on Pearl Harbor and recorded 
10 Japanese aircraft kills. Lieutenant 
Taylor was credited with two 
kills and two probables. On December 
13, 1941, the U.S. War Department 
named Lieutenants Taylor and Welsh 
as the official first two heroes of World 
War II and both were awarded the Distinguished 
Flying Cross on January 8. 
When asked about his actions that day, 
Taylor reflected, ‘‘I wasn’t in the least 
bit terrified, and let me tell you why: I 
was too young and too stupid to realize 
that I was in a lot of danger.’’ Lieutenant 
Taylor went on to a record total of 
six career kills, designating him as a 
flying ace. 

Ken Taylor served for 27 years of active 
duty before joining the Alaska Air 
National Guard in 1967. He has commanded 
at all levels, retiring as a brigadier 
general in 1971. His Pearl Harbor 
experience was portrayed in the 1970 
film ‘‘Tora! Tora! Tora!’’ and the 2001 
film ‘‘Pearl Harbor.’’ Ken passed away 
on 25 November 2006 just a few days shy 
of his 65th birthday. He is buried at Arlington 
National Cemetery. 

I am honored to be able to present 
this small tribute to an American hero 
whose leadership and bravery ensured 
our Nation and its people remain free 
and strong. We must never forget the 
sacrifices of those who have gone before 
us as well as those who are sacrificing 
today. I offer my sincere thanks 
and appreciation to Ken Taylor and his 
family for his service to our great Nation.

August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8027 

CONGRATULATING THE CITY OF 
PLYMOUTH, MINNESOTA 

S Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
wish to congratulate the city of Plymouth, 
MN, for being named the ‘‘Best 
City in America’’ by the staff and writers 
of Money Magazine. 

Because of this recognition, the 
country now knows what the residents 
of Plymouth, MN, have already known: 
that Plymouth is an exceptional place 
to live and grow, rich in culture and 
character. 

The median household costs of single 
family homes in Plymouth allow families 
to responsibly purchase homes that 
are appropriate to their needs. When 
looking for educational or entertainment 
opportunities though, residents 
of Plymouth have access to a wide 
array of events at the Hilde Performance 
Center and other entertainment 
venues, as well as 40 public parks, 100 
miles of trails, and half a dozen large 
lakes to swim, fish, and run around. 
With over 104 libraries within 15 miles, 
it is no surprise that the Plymouth 
public school system is ranked among 
the top three districts in a State renowned 
for education leadership. There 
are also 27 colleges, universities, and 
professional schools within a few miles 
of the city, exemplifying why 83 percent 
of Plymouth’s citizens attended 
college. 

Plymouth is not only the best city in 
America because of its proximity to 
arts, education, and the outdoors, it is 
also home to a healthy and thriving 
economy and active local government. 
The 50,000 jobs created in the city of 
Plymouth aids in independent business 
development, low crime rates, and allows 
for greater access to heath care 
options, so critical to Plymouth’s low 
rates of diabetes and hypertension. 
Plymouth’s local government recently 
led an effort to have a ‘‘green roof’’ and 
rain gardens installed when City Hall 
was expanded, thereby reducing greenhouse 
gases and mitigating the impact 
of pollution through water runoff. 

Acknowledging this city’s many successes, 
today I encourage other communities 
to follow the lead of Plymouth, 
MN, and encourage business leadership, 
civic investment, and community 
cohesiveness through its commerce, 
government, schools, entertainment, 
and health care initiatives.S

TRIBUTE TO TOM J. MORRIS 

S Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I 
would like to take a few minutes to reflect 
upon the memory of Tom J. Morris, 
a true hero to the men and women 
of Louisiana. Tom died while traveling 
on vacation with his wife Denise in 
Boston last Friday morning. As an individual 
who shares his commitment to 
civil service and the State of Louisiana, 
I wanted to honor his truly inspiring 
career. For the last 19 years, 
Tom was the CEO for the United Way 
of Southwest Louisiana, Inc., in Lake 
Charles. In sum, he had a combined 30 

years of service with the United Way 
and was considered a leader in the community 
of Lake Charles, particularly 
in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and 
Rita. As you know, United Way is a 
nonprofit organization dedicated to 
nurturing the future generations and 
youth of the United States. Tom Morris 
was a man who represented the convictions 
of this Nation’s youth, by 
bringing together communities and organizations 
in order to solve today’s dilemmas. 
Louisiana is still in the wake 
of the hurricanes, and his dedicated assistance 
to victims, as well as the general 
community, will be sorely missed. 
His efforts to inspire young volunteers 
and assist in hurricane recovery are 
still considered vital to the reconstruction 
of local communities in Louisiana. 
To his family and his wife Denise, I extend 
my condolences and my prayers. 
Tom Morris’s efforts are truly inspirational 
and will always be remembered, 
not only by the men and women of 
southwest Louisiana but by also by the 
Nation as a whole.S

ANIVERSARY OF THE DITCHLEY 

FOUNDATION 
S Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to pay 
tribute to the work of the Ditchley 
Foundation on the occasion of the 50th 
anniversary of its founding. 

Since the foundation’s inception in 
1958, several of my colleagues, on both 
sides of the aisle and in both Chambers 
of the Congress, have taken part in the 
conferences held at Ditchley Park. 
This beautiful 18th century country 
house a few miles outside of Oxford, 
England, was used as a weekend retreat 
by Prime Minister Winston Churchill 
and Averill Harriman, then U.S. Ambassador 
to Great Britain, during the 
frequent bombings of London during 
World War II. Today, Ditchley Park is 
home to around a dozen conferences 
each year on topics of relevance to 
transatlantic relations and international 
policy concerns in general. 
This series includes a keynote annual 
address given by a distinguished lecturer 
every summer. 

This year’s lecture gathering was especially 
noteworthy during this anniversary 
year. Individuals from a number 
of fields and countries attended, including 
our former colleague in the 
House of Representatives, now president 
emeritus of New York University, 
Dr. John Brademas. Dr. Brademas is 
himself a trustee of the Ditchley Foundation 
and was for several years chairman 
of the American Ditchley Foundation. 


The current chairman is Rita E. 
Hauser, president of the Hauser Foundation 
and a former member of the 
President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory 
Board. Further, the executive director 
of American Ditchley is John J. 
O’Conner, vice chancellor and secretary 
of the State University of New 
York. 

At the annual lecture on July 11, 
2008, chairman of the Ditchley Founda


tion and former Prime Minister of the 
United Kingdom John Major made the 
following introductory remarks, which 
I would like to share with my colleagues. 
I ask to have the remarks 
printed in the RECORD. 

The material follows. 

‘‘Ditchley is one of the hidden gems of the 
Transatlantic relationship. 

It doesn’t feature in Presidential speeches 
or Prime Ministerial briefing. Mercifully, it 
is not a plaything of the media: but its role 
as a clearing house for ideas; a forum for debate 
and discussion; and a magnet for policy-
makers gives it a unique status. It is the intellectual 
expression of ‘soft power’ and a 
tribute to the pre-eminence of reason and rational 
debate. 

Of course—you all know that: it is why you 
are here. All of you know Ditchley, are committed 
to Ditchley, care about its future and 
have contributed generously to ensure it. 
For that—I thank you most warmly; it is a 
delight to see you all here this evening. My 
only regret is that many others—who also 
care for Ditchley and have been enormously 
generous to it—could not be here to join us. 
In their absence, I thank them, too, for all 
their support. 

On Ditchley’s 50th Anniversary, I think it 
worthwhile to look at its role. 

My father was half-American. Brought up 
in the United States he drilled into me as a 
boy the importance of the Transatlantic relationship. 
His affection for it was emotional—
but the economic, political and military 
case is even stronger. And yet we cannot 
take this for granted; it is not necessarily 
a fixed star in the firmament. Geography 
hugs Britain to her neighbors in Europe, 
and so does trade. 

Trade and real politik turn American eyes 
to the East: there is no room for complacency. 
The most successful alliance in history 
is not immutable. It needs cherishing to 
keep it in good order. 

Ditchley plays a role in this. And why is 
that? It is, of course, because thoughtful 
minds—lifting debate from the ephemeral to 
the eternal—see the importance (and the 
self-interest if you like) of nurturing Transatlantic 
ties. 

But there is a further reason why Ditchley 
plays a role—a more prosaic reason. It is because 
one man saw the importance of the 
subject and had the vision to establish 
Ditchley in order to do something about it. 
That man was David Wills. Today, we remember 
and honour his vision, his commitment 
and his generosity. He saw the need— 
forgive the unintended pun—and he willed 
the means. David Wills is the Father of 
Ditchley and the effect of his invisible hand 
is evident in the continuing and instinctive 
relationship of trust that we take for granted 
across the Atlantic. 

He chose wisely, too, in entrusting his legacy 
to Lady Wills and Catherine Wills. No 
one could have cared for Ditchley more, and 
their generosity has always been outstanding. 
I don’t simply mean generosity in 
material terms—though certainly that, for 
the Wills family were by far the largest contributors 
to our recent fundraising campaign—
but also their personal commitment 
in time and involvement. They are the living 
embodiment of Ditchley. I believe they can 
be satisfied that their actions have helped 
bind the ties that keep us safe and prosperous. 


Following Sir John’s remarks, the 
annual lecture was delivered by an 
eminent British scholar and scientist, 
Professor Martin Rees, a member of 
the House of Lords. President of the 
Royal Society, Lord Rees of Ludlow is 


S8028 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

also Master of Trinity College, Cambridge 
University, and Astronomer 
Royal. The address by Lord Rees, in 
full, was as follows: 

Last year, Brent Scowcroft stood at this 
podium as Ditchley Lecturer. It’s daunting 
to follow him. I’ll take as my text his concluding 
words: 

‘‘If we behave wisely, prudently and in 
close strategic cooperation with each other, 
the 21st century could be the best yet in the 
rather dismal history of mankind.’’ 

This is the 50th anniversary of the 
Ditchley Foundation, and I’ve been asked to 
offer a scientist’s perspective on the next 
fifty years. As an astronomer, I often get 
mistakenly described as an astrologer—but I 
cast no horoscopes and have no crystal ball. 
My message will be that the Promethean 
power of science offers greater opportunities 
than ever before—for the developing and the 
developed world. We can indeed be optimistic: 
we can surely expect huge economic 
and social advances, especially in Asia. But 
there will be new challenges and 
vulnerabilities to contend with. 

THE LAST 50 YEARS 

Fifty years ago no-one here could confidently 
have predicted the geopolitical landscape 
of today. And scientific forecasting is 
just as hazardous. Three of today’s most remarkable 
technologies had their gestation in 
the 1950s. But nobody could then have 
guessed how pervasively they would shape 
our lives today. 

It was in 1958 that Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments 
and Robert Noyce of Fairchild 
Semiconductors built the first integrated 
circuit—the precursor of today’s ubiquitous 
silicon chips, each containing literally billions 
of microscopic circuit elements. This 
was perhaps the most transformative single 
invention of the past century. 

A second technology with huge potential 
began in Cambridge in the 1950s, when Watson 
and Crick discovered the bedrock mechanism 
of heredity—the famous double helix. 
This discovery launched the science of molecular 
biology, opening exciting prospects 
in genomics and synthetic biology. 

And it’s just over 50 years since the launch 
of Sputnik. This event started the ‘space 
race’, and led President Kennedy to inaugurate 
the programme to land men on the 
Moon. Kennedy’s prime motive was of course 
superpower rivalry—cynics could deride it as 
a stunt. But it was an extraordinary technical 
triumph—especially as NASA’s total 
computing power was far less than in a single 
mobile phone today. And it had an inspirational 
aspect too: it offered a new perspective 
on our planet. Distant images of Earth— 
its delicate biosphere of clouds, land and 
oceans contrasting with the sterile moonscape 
where the astronauts left their footprints—
have, ever since the 1960s, been 
iconic for environmentalists. 

Most of us here are old enough to recall 
the Apollo programme. But it’s nearly 40 
years since Neil Armstrong’s ‘first small 
step’. To young people today, however, this 
is ancient history: they know that the Americans 
went to the Moon, just as they know 
the Egyptians built pyramids, but the motives 
for these two enterprises may seem 
equally baffling. 

There was no real follow-on after Apollo: 
there is no practical or scientific motive adequate 
to justify the huge expense of NASA-
style manned spaceflight, and it has lost its 
glamour. But unmanned space technology 
has flourished, giving us GPS, global communications, 
environmental monitoring and 
other everyday benefits, as well as an immense 
scientific yield. But of course there is 
a dark side. Its initial motivation was to 

provide missiles to carry nuclear weapons. 
And those weapons were themselves the outcome 
of a huge enterprise, the Manhattan 
project, that was even more intense and focused 
than the Apollo programme. 

Soon after World War II, some physicists 
who had been involved in the Manhattan 
project founded a journal called the Bulletin 
of Atomic Scientists, aimed at promoting 
arms control. The ‘logo’ on the Bulletin’s 
cover is a clock, the closeness of whose 
hands to midnight indicates the Editorial 
Board’s judgement on how precarious the 
world situation is. Every year or two, the 
minute hand is shifted, either forwards or 
backwards. 

It was closest to midnight at the time of 
the Cuban Missile Crisis. Robert MacNamara 
spoke frankly about that episode in his confessional 
movie ‘Fog of War’. He said that 
‘‘We came within a hairbreadth of nuclear 
war without realising it. It’s no credit to us 
that we escaped—Khrushchev and Kennedy 
were lucky as well as wise’’. Indeed on several 
occasions during the Cold War the superpowers 
could have stumbled towards armageddon. 


When the Cold War ended, the Bulletin’s 
clock was put back to 17 minutes to midnight. 
There is now far less risk of tens of 
thousands of H-bombs devastating our 
civilisation. Indeed one clear reason for sharing 
Brent Scowcroft’s optimism is that the 
greatest peril to confront the world from the 
1950s to the 1980s—massive nuclear annihilation—
has diminished. 

But the clock has been creeping forward 
again. There is increasing concern about nuclear 
proliferation, and about nuclear weapons 
being deployed in a localised conflict. 
And Al Qaida-style terrorists might some 
day acquire a nuclear weapon. If they did, 
they would willingly detonate it in a city, 
killing tens of thousands along with themselves, 
and millions would acclaim them as 
heroes. 

And the threat of a global nuclear catastrophe 
could be merely in temporary abeyance. 
I’m diffident about even mentioning 
such matters to an audience where there’s so 
much experience and expertise. But during 
this century, geopolitical realignments could 
be as drastic as those during the last century, 
and could lead to a nuclear standoff between 
new superpowers that might be handled 
less well—or less luckily—than the Cuba 
crisis was. 

The nuclear age inaugurated an era when 
humans could threaten the entire Earth’s future—
what some have called the 
‘anthropocene’ era. We’ll never be completely 
rid of the nuclear threat. But the 21st 
century confronts us with new perils as 
grave as the bomb. They may not threaten a 
sudden world-wide catastrophe—the doomsday 
clock is not such a good metaphor—but 
they are, in aggregate, worrying and challenging. 


I want briefly to address some of these 
themes, and then, near the end of my lecture, 
to comment on the role of science and 
scientists in the policy arena. 

ENERGY AND CLIMATE 

High on the global agenda are energy supply 
and energy security. These are crucial 
for economic and political stability, and 
linked of course to the grave issue of long-
term climate change. 

Human actions—mainly the burning of fossil 
fuels—have already raised the carbon dioxide 
concentration higher than it’s ever 
been in the last half million years. Moreover, 
according to ‘business as usual’ scenarios, it 
will reach twice the pre-industrial level by 
2050, and three times that level later in the 
century. This much is entirely 
uncontroversial. Nor is there significant 

doubt that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and that 
the higher its concentration rises, the greater 
the warming—and, more important still, 
the greater the chance of triggering something 
grave and irreversible: rising sea levels 
due to the melting of Greenland’s icecap; 
runaway greenhouse warming due to release 
of methane in the tundra, and so forth. 

There is a substantial uncertainty in just 
how sensitive the temperature is to the CO2 
level. The climate models can, however, assess 
the likelihood of a range of temperature 
rises. It is the ‘high-end tail’ of the probability 
distribution that should worry us 
most—the small probability of a really drastic 
climatic shift. Climate scientists now 
aim to refine their calculations, and to address 
questions like: Where will the flood 
risks be concentrated? What parts of Africa 
will suffer severest drought? Where will the 
worst hurricanes strike? 

The ‘headline figures’ that the climate 
modellers quote—2, 3 or 5 degrees rise in the 
mean global temperature—might seem too 
small to fuss about. But two comments 
should put them into perspective. 

First, even in the depth of the last ice age 
the mean temperature was lower by just 5 
degrees. Second, the prediction isn’t a uniform 
warming: the land warms more than 
the sea, and high latitudes more than low. 
Quoting a single figure glosses over shifts in 
global weather patterns that will be more 
drastic in some regions than in others, and 
could involve relatively sudden ‘flips’ rather 
than steady changes. 

Nations can adapt to some of the adverse 
effects of warming. But the most vulnerable 
people—in, for instance, Africa or in Bangladesh—
are the least able to adapt. 

The science of climate change is intricate. 
But it’s a doddle compared to the economics 
and politics. Global warming poses a unique 
political challenge for two reasons. First, the 
effect is non-localised: the CO2 emissions 
from this country have no more effect here 
than they do in Australia, and vice versa. 
That means that any credible regime whereby 
the ‘polluter pays’ has to be broadly 
international. 

Second, there are long time-lags—it takes 
decades for the oceans to adjust to a new 
equilibrium, and centuries for ice-sheets to 
melt completely. So the main downsides of 
global warming lie a century or more in the 
future. Concepts of intergenerational justice 
then come into play: How should we rate the 
rights and interests of future generations 
compared to our own? What discount rate 
should we apply? 

In his influential 2006 report for the UK 
government, Nicholas Stern argued that equity 
to future generations renders a ‘commercial’ 
discount rate quite inappropriate. 
Largely on that basis he argues that we 
should commit substantial resources now, to 
pre-empt much greater costs in future decades. 


There are of course precedents for long-
term altruism. Indeed, in discussing the safe 
disposal of nuclear waste, experts talk with 
a straight face about what might happen 
more than 10,000 years from now, thereby implicitly 
applying a zero discount rate. To 
concern ourselves with such a remote ‘post-
human’ era might seem bizarre. But all of us 
can surely empathise at least a century 
ahead. Especially in Europe, we’re mindful of 
the heritage we owe to centuries past; history 
will judge us harshly if we discount too 
heavily what might happen when our grandchildren 
grow old. 

To ensure a better-than-evens chance of 
avoiding a potentially dangerous ‘tipping 
point’; global CO2 emissions must, by 2050, be 
brought down to half the 1990 level. This is 
the target espoused by the G8. It corresponds 
to two tons of CO2 per year from 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8029 

each person on the planet. For comparison, 
the current European figure is about 10, and 
the Chinese level is already 4. To achieve 
this target without stifling economic 
growth—to turn around the curve of CO2 
emissions well before 2050—is a huge challenge. 
The debates last week in Japan indicated 
the problems—especially how to bring 
India and China into the frame. The great 
emerging economies have not caused the 
present problem, but if they develop in as 
carbon-intensive a way as ours did, they 
could swamp and negate any measures taken 
by the G8 alone. 

Realistically, however, there is no chance 
of reaching this target, nor of achieving real 
energy security, without drastically new 
technologies. Though I’m confident that 
these will have emerged by the second half of 
the century, the worry is that this may not 
be soon enough. 

Efforts to develop a whole raft of techniques 
for economising on energy, storing it 
and generating it by ‘clean’ or low-carbon 
methods, deserve a priority and commitment 
from governments akin to that accorded to 
the Manhattan project or the Apollo moon 
landing. Current R and D is far less than the 
scale and urgency demands. To speed things 
up, we need a ‘shotgun approach’—trying all 
the options. And we can afford it: the stakes 
are colossal. The world spends around 7 trillion 
dollars per year on energy and its infrastructure. 
The U.S. imports 500 billion dollars 
worth of oil each year. 

I can’t think of anything that could do 
more to attract the brightest and best into 
science than a strongly proclaimed commitment—
led by the U.S. and Europe—to provide 
clean and sustainable energy for the developing 
and the developed world. 

Even optimists about prospects in solar energy, 
advanced biofuels, fusion and other renewables 
have to acknowledge that it will be 
at least 40 years before they can fully ‘take 
over’. Coal, oil and gas seem set to dominate 
the world’s every-growing energy needs for 
at least that long. Last year the Chinese 
built 100 coal-fired power stations. Coal deposits 
representing a million years’ accumulation 
of primeval forest are now being burnt 
in a single year. 

Coal is the most ‘inefficient’ fossil fuel in 
terms of energy generated per unit of carbon 
released. Annual CO2 emissions are rising 
year by year. Unless this rising curve can be 
turned around sooner, the atmospheric concentration 
will irrevocably reach a threatening 
level. 

So an immediate priority has to be a coordinated 
international effort to develop carbon 
capture and storage—CCS. Carbon from 
power stations must be captured before it escapes 
in the atmosphere; and then piped to 
some geological formation where it can be 
stored without leaking out. It’s crucial to 
agree a timetable, and a coordinated plan for 
the construction of CCS demonstration 
plants to explore all variants of the technology. 
To jump-start such a programme 
would need up to 10 billion dollars a year of 
public funding worldwide (preferably as part 
of public-private partnerships). But this is a 
small price to pay for bringing forward, by 
five years or more, the time when CCS can 
be widely adopted and the graph of CO2 emissions 
turned around. 

What is the role of nuclear power in all 
this? The concerns are well known—it is an 
issue where expert and lay opinions are 
equally divided. I’m myself in favour of the 
UK and the U.S. having at least a replacement 
generation of power stations—and of R 
and D into new kinds of reactors. But the 
non-proliferation regime is fragile, and before 
being relaxed about a world-wide pro-
gramme of nuclear power, one would surely 
require the kind of fuel bank and leasing ar


rangement that has been proposed by 
Mohamed el Baradei at the IAEA . 

NATURAL RESOURCES AND POPULATION 

Energy security and climate change are 
the prime ‘threats without enemies’ that 
confront us. But there are others. High 
among these is the threat to biological diversity 
caused by rapid changes in land use and 
deforestation. There have been 5 great 
extinctions in the geological past; human actions 
are causing a 6th. The extinction rate 
is 1000 times higher than normal, and increasing. 
We are destroying the book of life 
before we have read it. 

Biodiversity—manifested in forests, coral 
reefs, marine blue waters and all Earth’s 
other ecosystems—is often proclaimed as a 
crucial component of human wellbeing and 
economic growth. It manifestly is: we’re 
clearly harmed if fish stocks dwindle to extinction; 
there are plants whose gene pool 
might be useful to us. And massive destruction 
of the rain forests would accelerate 
global warming. But for environmentalists 
these ‘instrumental’—and anthropocentric— 
arguments aren’t the only compelling ones. 
For them, preserving the richness of our biosphere 
has value in its own right, over and 
above what it means to us humans. 

Population growth, of course, aggravates 
all pressures on energy and environment. 
Fifty years ago the world population was 
below 3 billion. It has more than doubled 
since then, to 6.6 billion. The percentage 
growth-rate has slowed, but the global figure 
is projected to reach 8 or even 9 billion by 
2050. The excess will almost all be in the developing 
world. 

There is, incidentally, a global trend from 
rural towards urban living. More than half 
the world’s population is now urban—and 
megacities are growing explosively. 

There is an extensive literature on the 
‘carrying capacity’ of our planet—on how 
many people it can sustain without irreversible 
degradation. The answer of course depends 
on lifestyle. The world could not sustain 
its present population if everyone lived 
like present-day Americans or Europeans. On 
the other hand, the pressures would plainly 
be eased if people travelled little and 
interacted via super-internet and virtual reality. 
And, incidentally, if they were all 
vegetarians: it takes 13 pounds of corn to 
make one pound of beef. 

If population growth continues even beyond 
2050, one can’t be other than exceedingly 
gloomy about the prospects. However, 
there could be a turnaround. There are now 
more than 60 countries in which fertility is 
below replacement level—it’s far below in, 
for instance, Italy and Singapore. In Iran the 
fertility rate has fallen from 6.5 in 1980 to 2.1 
today. We all know the social trends that 
lead to this demographic transition—declining 
infant mortality, availability of contraceptive 
advice, women’s education, and so 
forth. 

If the transition quickly extended to all 
countries, then the global population could 
start a gradual decline after 2050—a development 
that would surely be benign. 

There is, incidentally, one ‘wild card’ in all 
these long-term forecasts. This is the possibility 
that the average lifespan in advanced 
countries may be extended drastically by 
some biomedical breakthrough. 

The prognosis is especially bleak in Africa, 
where there could be a billion more people in 
2050 than there are today. It’s worth quoting 
some numbers here. A hundred years ago, 
the population of Ethiopia was 5 million. It 
is now 75 million (of whom 8 million need 
permanent food aid) and will almost double 
by 2050. Quite apart from the problem of providing 
services, there is consequent pressure 
on the water resources of the Nile basin. 

Over 200 years ago, Thomas Malthus famously 
argued that populations would rise 
until limited by food shortages. His gloomy 
prognosis has been forestalled by advancing 
technology, the green revolution and so 
forth, but he could be tragically vindicated 
in Africa. Continuing population growth 
makes it harder to break out of the poverty 
trap—Africa not only needs more food, but a 
million more teachers annually, just to keep 
standards level. And just as today’s population 
couldn’t be fed by yesterday’s agriculture, 
a second green revolution may be 
needed to feed tomorrow’s population. 

But the rich world has the resources, if the 
will is there, to enhance the life-chances of 
the world’s billion poorest people—relieving 
the most extreme poverty, providing clean 
water, primary education and other basics. 
This is a precondition of achieving in Africa 
the demographic tradition that has occurred 
elsewhere. The overseas aid from most countries, 
including the U.S., is far below the 
UN’s target of 0.7 percent of GNP. It would 
surely be shameful, as well as against even 
our narrow self-interests, if the Millennium 
Goals set for 2015 were not met. 

(To inject a pessimistic note in parenthesis, 
the meagre underfunding of overseas 
aid, even in a context where the humanitarian 
imperative seems so clear, augurs 
badly for the actual implementation of the 
measures needed to meet the 2050 carbon 
emission targets—generally quoted as 
around 1 percent of GNP—where the payoff is 
less immediately apparent.) 

SOME NEW VULNERABILITIES 
Infectious diseases are mainly associated 
with developing countries—but in our interconnected 
world we are now all more vulnerable. 
The spread of epidemics is aggravated 
by rapid air travel, plus the huge concentrations 
in megacities with fragile infrastructures. 
Whether or not a pandemic gets global grip 
may hinge on the efficiency of worldwide 
monitoring—how quickly a Vietnamese or 
Sudanese poultry farmer can diagnose or report 
any strange sickness. 
In our everyday lives, we have a confused 
attitude to risk. We fret about tiny risks: 
carcinogens in food, a one-in-a-million 
chance of being killed in train crashes, and 
so forth. But we’re in denial about others 
that should loom much larger. If we apply to 
pandemics the same prudent analysis that 
leads us to buy insurance—multiplying probability 
by consequences—we’d surely conclude 
that measures to alleviate this kind of 
extreme event need higher priority. A global 
pandemic could kill tens of millions and cost 
many trillions of dollars. 
This thought leads me to new 
vulnerabilities of a different kind: 
vulnerabilities stemming from the misuse of 
powerful technologies—either through error 
or by design. Biotechnology, for instance, 
holds huge promise for health care, for enhanced 
food production, even for energy. But 
there is a downside. 
Here’s a quote from the American National 
Academy of Sciences: ‘‘Just a few individuals 
with specialized skills . . . could inexpensively 
and easily produce a panoply of lethal 
biological weapons.... The deciphering 
of the human genome sequence and 
the complete elucidation of numerous pathogen 
genomes . . . allow science to be misused 
to create new agents of mass destruction’.’’ 
Not even an organized network would be 
required: just a fanatic, or a weirdo with the 
mindset of those who now design computer 
viruses—the mindset of an arsonist. The 
techniques and expertise for bio or cyber attacks 
will be accessible to millions. 
We’re kidding ourselves if we think that 
technical expertise is always allied with balanced 
rationality: it can be combined with 


S8030 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

fanaticism—not just the traditional fundamentalism 
that we’re so mindful of today, 
but new age irrationalities. I’m thinking of 
cults such as the Raelians: and of extreme 
eco-freaks, animal rights campaigners and 
the like. The global village will have its village 
idiots. 

In a future era of vast individual empowerment, 
where even one malign act would be 
too many, how can our open society be safeguarded? 
Will there be pressures to constrain 
diversity and individualism? Or to shift the 
balance between privacy and intrusion? 
These are stark questions, but I think they 
are deeply serious ones. (Though—to inject a 
slightly frivolous comment—the careless 
abandon with which younger people put their 
intimate details on Facebook, and the broad 
acquiescence in ubiquitous CCTV, suggests 
that in our society there will be surprisingly 
little resistance to loss of privacy.) 

Developments in cyber, bio or nano-technology 
will open up new risks of error or terror. 
Our global society is precariously dependent 
on elaborate networks—electricity 
grids, air traffic control, the internet, just-
in-time delivery and so forth—whose collapse 
could stress it to breaking point. It’s 
crucial to ensure maximal resilience of all 
such systems. 

At the start of this lecture, I cited three 
technologies that now pervade our lives in 
ways quite unenvisioned 50 years ago. Likewise, 
by extrapolating from the present, I 
have surely missed the qualitatively greatest 
changes that may occur in the next 50. 

The great science-fiction writer Arthur C. 
Clark opined that any ultra-advanced technology 
was indistinguishable from magic. 
Everyday consumer items like Sony game 
stations, sat-nav and Google would have 
seemed magic 50 years ago. 

In the coming decades, there could be 
qualitatively new kinds of change. One thing 
that’s been unaltered for millennia is human 
nature and human character. But in this 
century, novel mind-enhancing drugs, genetics, 
and ‘cyberg’ techniques may start to 
alter human beings themselves. That’s something 
qualitatively new in recorded history. 

And we should keep our minds open, or at 
least ajar, to concepts on the fringe of 
science fiction—robots with many human attributes, 
computers that make discoveries 
worthy of Nobel prizes, bioengineered organisms, 
and so forth. Flaky Californian 
futurologists aren’t always wrong. 

Opinion polls in England show that people 
are generally positive about science’s role, 
but are concerned that it may ‘run away’ 
faster than we can properly cope with it. 
Some commentators on biotech, robotics and 
nanotech worry that when the genie is out of 
the bottle, the outcome may be impossible to 
control. They urge caution in ‘pushing the 
envelope’ in some areas of science. 

The uses of academic research generally 
can’t be foreseen: Rutherford famously said, 
in the mid-thirties, that nuclear energy was 
‘moonshine’; the inventors of lasers didn’t 
foresee that an early application of their 
work would be to eye surgery; the discoverer 
of x-rays was not searching for ways to see 
through flesh. A major scientific discovery is 
likely to have many applications—some benign, 
others less so—none of which was foreseen 
by the original investigator. 

We can’t reap the benefits of science without 
accepting some risks—the best we can do 
is minimize them. Most surgical procedures, 
even if now routine, were risky and often 
fatal when they were being pioneered. In the 
early days of steam, people died when poorly 
designed boilers exploded. 

But something has changed. Most of the 
‘old’ risks were localized. If a boiler explodes, 
it’s horrible but there’s an ‘upper 
bound’ to just how horrible. In our ever more 

interconnected world, there are new risks 
whose consequences could be so widespread 
that even a tiny probability is unacceptable. 

There will surely be a widening gulf between 
what science enables us to do, and 
what applications it’s prudent or ethical actually 
to pursue—more doors that science 
could open but which are best kept closed. 

There are already scientific procedures— 
human reproductive cloning, synthetic biology 
and the rest—where regulation is called 
for, on ethical as well as prudential grounds. 
And there will be more. Regulations will 
need to be international, and to contend 
with commercial pressures—and they may 
prove as hard to enforce as the drug laws. If 
one country alone imposed regulations, the 
most dynamic researchers and enterprising 
companies would migrate to another that 
was more permissive. This is happening already, 
in a small way, in primate and stem 
cell research. 

THE INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY 

Some comments, now, on the role of the 
scientific community. Science is the only 
truly global culture: protons, proteins, and 
Pythagoras’s theorem are the same from 
China to Peru. Research is international, 
highly networked, and collaborative. And 
most science-linked policy issues are international, 
even global—that’s certainly true 
of those I’ve addressed in this lecture. 

This is primarily an Anglo-American gathering, 
so I hope it’s not out of place to emphasis 
that our two countries have been the 
most successful in creating and sustaining 
world-class research universities. These institutions 
are magnets for talent—both faculty 
and students—from all over the world, 
and are in most cases embedded in a ‘cluster’ 
of high-tech companies, to symbiotic benefit. 

By 2050, China and India should at least 
gain parity with Europe and the US—they 
will surely become the ‘centre of gravity’ of 
the world’s intellectual power. We will need 
to aim high if we are to sustain our competitive 
advantage in offering cutting-edge 
‘value added’. 

It’s a duty of scientific academies and 
similar bodies to ensure that policy decisions 
are based on the best science, even 
when that science is still uncertain and provisional; 
this is the Royal Society’s role in 
the UK and that of the National Academy of 
Sciences in the US. The academies of the G8 

+ 5 countries are playing an increasing role 
in highlighting global issues. And one thinks 
of consortia like the IPCC, and bodies like 
the WHO. 
In this country, an ongoing dialogue with 
parliamentarians on embryos and stem cells 
has led to a generally-admired legal framework. 
On the other hand, the GM crops debate 
went wrong here because we came in 
too late, when opinion was already polarized 
between eco-campaigners on the one side and 
commercial interests on the other. I think 
we have recently done better on 
nanotechnology, by raising the key issues 
early. It’s necessary to engage with the public 
‘upstream’ of any legislation or commercial 
developments. 

We need to point out that the resources 
and expertise devoted to applications of 
science are not deployed optimally. Some 
subjects have had the ‘inside track’ and 
gained disproportionate resources; huge 
sums, for instance, are still devoted to new 
weaponry. On the other hand, environmental 
projects, renewable energy, and so forth, deserve 
more effort. In medicine, the focus is 
disproportionately on cancer and cardiovascular 
studies, the ailments that loom 
largest in prosperous countries, rather than 
on the infections endemic in the tropics. 

Policy decisions—whether about energy, 
GM technology, mind-enhancing drugs or 

whatever—are never solely ‘scientific’: strategic, 
economic, social, and ethical ramifications 
enter as well. And here scientists have 
no special credentials. Choices on how 
science is applied shouldn’t be made just by 
scientists. That’s why everyone needs a ‘feel’ 
for science and a realistic attitude to risk— 
otherwise public debate won’t rise above the 
level of tabloid slogans. 

Scientists nonetheless have a special responsibility. 
We feel there is something lacking 
in parents who don’t care what happens 
to their children in adulthood, even though 
this is largely beyond their control. Likewise, 
scientists shouldn’t be indifferent to 
the fruits of their ideas—their intellectual 
creations. They should try to foster benign 
spin-offs—and of course help to bring their 
work to market when appropriate. But they 
should campaign to resist, so far as they can, 
ethically dubious or threatening applications. 
And they should be prepared to engage 
in public debate and discussion. 

I mentioned earlier the atomic scientists 
in World War II. Many of them—and I’ve 
been privileged to know some, such as Hans 
Bethe and Joseph Rotblat—set a fine example. 
Fate had assigned them a pivotal role in 
history. They returned with relief to peacetime 
academic pursuits. But they didn’t say 
that they were ‘just scientists’ and that the 
use made of their work was up to politicians. 
They continued as engaged citizens—promoting 
efforts to control the power they had 
helped unleash. We now need such individuals—
not just in physics, but across the 
whole range of applicable science. 

A COSMIC PERSPECTIVE 

My special subject is astronomy—the 
study of our environment in the widest conceivable 
sense. And I’d like to end with a 
cosmic perspective. 

It is surely a cultural deprivation to be unaware 
of the marvelous vision of nature offered 
by Darwinism and by modern cosmology—
the chain of emergent complexity 
leading from a still-mysterious beginning to 
atoms, stars, planets, biospheres and human 
brains able to ponder the wonder and the 
mystery. And there’s no reason to regard humans 
as the culmination of this emergent 
process. Our Sun is less than half way 
through its life. Any creatures witnessing 
the Sun’s demise, here on earth or far beyond, 
won’t be human—they’ll be as different 
from us as we are from bacteria. 

But, even in this cosmic time-perspective— 
extending billions of years into the future, as 
well as into the past—this century may be a 
defining moment. It’s the first in our planet’s 
history where one species—ours—has 
Earth’s future in its hands. 

I recalled earlier the image of our Earth 
viewed from space. Suppose some aliens had 
been watching our planet—a ‘pale blue dot’ 
in a vast cosmos, for its entire history, what 
would they have seen? 

Over nearly all that immense time, 4.5 billion 
years, Earth’s appearance would have 
altered very gradually. The continents drifted; 
the ice cover waxed and waned; successive 
species emerged, evolved and became extinct. 


But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth’s history—
the last one millionth part, a few 
thousand years—the patterns of vegetation 
altered much faster than before. This signaled 
the start of agriculture. The changes 
accelerated as human populations rose. 

But then there were other changes, even 
more abrupt. Within fifty years—little more 
than one hundredth of a millionth of the 
Earth’s age, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
began to rise anomalously fast. The 
planet became an intense emitter of radio 
waves (the total output from all TV, 
cellphone and radar transmissions). 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8031 

And something else unprecedented happened: 
small projectiles lifted from the planet’s 
surface and escaped the biosphere completely. 
Some were propelled into orbits 
around the Earth; some journeyed to the 
Moon and planets. 

If they understood astrophysics, the aliens 
could confidently predict that the biosphere 
would face doom in a few billion years when 
the Sun flares up and dies. But could they 
have predicted this unprecedented spike less 
than half way through the Earth’s life—these 
human-induced alterations occupying, overall, 
less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime 
and seemingly occurring with runaway 
speed? 

If they continued to keep watch, what 
might these hypothetical aliens witness in 
the next hundred years? Will a final spasm 
be followed by silence? Or will the planet 
itself stabilize? And will some of the objects 
launched from the Earth spawn new oases of 
life elsewhere? 

The answers will depend on us, collectively—
on whether we can, to quote Brent 
Scowcroft again, ‘behave wisely, prudently.’’’

TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT PEYTON 
WILLIAMS 

S Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today 
I pay tribute to SGT Peyton Williams, 
a constituent of mine from Wetumpka, 
AL. Sergeant Williams was selected as 
the Marine of the Year for the Second 
Marine Division. Out of the over 20,000 
marines who comprise the Second Division, 
Sergeant Williams was selected 
for his outstanding performance in Operation 
Iraqi Freedom, OIF. This prestigious 
award signifies that Sergeant 
Williams represents the best of what a 

U.S. Marine should be. 
Later this month, Governor Bob 
Riley will proclaim August 21, 2008, as 
Sergeant Peyton Williams Day in the 
State of Alabama. I would like to express 
my pride in his accomplishment, 
and appreciation for his service to our 
Nation in Iraq. Sergeant Williams contributed 
to the success of the counterinsurgency 
in the Al Anbar province. 
His work there was critical to our success 
in our current operations and he 
serves as an example to his fellow marines 
and an inspiration to all young 
Alabamians who will follow him in 
service as members of the military. 

According to his company commander, 
CPT Brian Cillessen, ‘‘Peyton 
has more talent by accident than most 
Marines learn in a career. He is a great 
American who has served his country 
well, and I am proud to have the honor 
to serve with him and would welcome 
the opportunity in the future.’’ 

I would like to echo Captain 
Cillessen’s praise of Sergeant Williams, 
it is Marines like him who have ensured 
the success of the surge strategy. 
I believe that with dedicated marines 
like Sergeant Williams in the force, 
victory is not only possible in our current 
operations in Iraq, it is certain. 

And so, I applaud Sergeant Williams’ 
hard work, and I look forward to hearing 
more great things about this fine 
son of Alabama.S 

TRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF 
ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM 

S Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today 
I recognize the University of Alabama 
at Birmingham, UAB, a place known 
for its outstanding, world-renowned 
HIV/AIDS research and treatment. Dr. 
Michael Saag directs the Center for 
AIDS Research at UAB, which was established 
in 1988 by the National Institute 
for Allergy and Infectious Diseases 
to stimulate research and scientific 
advancement concerning AIDS 
and HIV. This program was initiated in 
1998 and currently includes 20 centers 
funded through a consortium of six National 
Institutes of Health. Under Dr. 
Saag’s exceptional leadership, the UAB 
Center for AIDS Research has grown 
dramatically as shown by its increase 
in total research funding, from $2.9 
million dollars in 1988 to over $90 million 
currently. 

UAB has a remarkable program in 
Zambia, the Center for Infectious Disease 
Research, headed up by Dr. Jeff 
Stringer. The UAB Zambia program, 
which receives funding through the 
President’s Emergency Program for 
AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, is treating over 
170,000 patients, with up to 100,000 patients 
on ARV treatment. 

Dr. Stringer and his remarkable 
team have also worked vigorously with 
the Zambian Government to deliver 
‘‘prevention of mother-to-child HIV 
transmission’’ services to over 500,000 
women in Zambia, preventing tens of 
thousands of infants from being born 
with HIV. The UAB HIV prevention and 
treatment service units support 175 
public health facilities in four of the 
nine provinces of Zambia. Prevention 
of mother-to-child transmission services 
are offered in 154 clinics and hospitals. 


HIV care and treatment services are 
offered in 46 sites, and include a comprehensive 
cervical cancer screening 
program that has screened over 5,000 
women in its first year. Research has 
shown a direct connection between HIV 
and cervical cancer among women, and 
groundbreaking work in the field has 
demonstrated the importance of 
screening HIV-infected women for cervical 
cancer, especially in resource-
poor countries of the world. Dr. 
Groesbeck Parham and his group from 
UAB/ CIDRZ, using PEPFAR resources, 
have led the way in creating mechanisms 
to screen large numbers of 
women in Zambia, saving thousands of 
lives. 

The UAB Zambia program also provides 
HIV testing to TB patients, and 
TB screening for all HIV patients in a 
comprehensive, integrated TB/HIV initiative. 


I applaud the fine work UAB is doing, 
and I know that their service has saved 
thousands of lives. This is a prime example 
of the clear, positive results we 
have seen come about through 
PEPFAR, and one major reason I 
worked to ensure that new PEPFAR 
legislation preserves the focus on 
treatment that has undoubtedly contributed 
to its success. 

I am proud of the role UAB has 
played on an international level in 
striving to provide top-notch treatment, 
as well as research to continuously 
improve on that treatment for 
Alabama, the nation, and the world, 
over the past 20 years.S

HONORING DR. EPHRAIM ZUROFF 

S Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise 
today to commend Dr. Ephraim Zuroff 
and the Simon Wiesenthal Center for 
their efforts to track down the last 
Nazi war criminals from World War II. 
Their work is enormously important, 
both in bringing the guilty to justice 
and preventing future acts of genocide. 
The statute of limitations does not, 
must not, expire on crimes against humanity. 
Earlier this year, I introduced 
the World War II War Crimes Accountability 
Act with Senator NELSON, 
which I hope will help Dr. Zuroff and 
the Simon Wiesenthal Center in their 
noble effort. 

One of the main targets of this effort 
is Sandor Kepiro, who is charged with 
the 1942 killing of about 1,000 Jews, 
Gypsies, and Serbs in Novi Sad, Serbia. 
Kepiro allegedly committed these 
crimes while serving as a Hungarian 
police captain during World War II. He 
was convicted in 1944, but the verdict 
was annulled when the Nazis invaded 
Hungary. He was convicted again in 
1946, in absentia, but escaped before 
serving his sentence. In 2007, a Hungarian 
court ruled that Kepiro could 
not be charged again for his alleged 
crimes. He is now living in Hungary, 
and the government continues to investigate 
the circumstances of his WWII 
activities. The Hungarian government 
must summon the political will to 
bring Kepiro to justice. Inaction is not 
an option. 

The Simon Wiesenthal Center 
launched Operation: Last Chance in 
2002, to identify and assist in the prosecution 
of the remaining Nazi war 
criminals still at large. Dr. Zuroff, who 
has been leading this effort, should be 
highly commended for his outstanding 
efforts in bringing the most guilty 
Nazis to justice. Of these, Kepiro is 
near the top of his list. 

Even today, the crimes of people like 
Kepiro in the service of pro-Nazi regimes 
strain our understanding of hate. 
National Socialist Germany today is 
an icon remembered only for its brutality, 
its mantra of genocide, and its 
culture of racism. And those last Nazis, 
who are waiting out their last days 
under the coming twilight, must not be 
allowed to go quietly into the night, as 
did too many of their victims. For the 
souls that were lost, and even more for 
those that remain, there must be justice. 
I commend Dr. Zuroff and the 
Simon Wiesenthal Center in the highest 
possible terms, and urge the United 
States Government to do all it can to 
help them in their cause.S

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 

By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. 
REED, Mr. KERRY, Mr. CARPER, 
Mrs. CLINTON, and Mr. BIDEN): 

S. 3425. A bill to make effective the 
proposed rule of the Food and Drug Administration 
relating to sunscreen 
drug products, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise 
today along with Senators JACK REED, 
JOHN KERRY, TOM CARPER, HILLARY 
RODHAM CLINTON, and JOE BIDEN to introduce 
the Sunscreen Labeling Protection 
Act of 2008, or the SUN Act. I 
thank them for their support of this 

legislation and have enjoyed working 
with them on the issue of sunscreen labeling. 
This is an issue I have been 
working on for more than a decade. I 
also want to thank the many outside 
organizations who support this legislation 
including the American Cancer 
Society, the Melanoma Research Foundation, 
and many others as well as the 
leading U.S. manufacturers of sunscreen, 
Banana Boat and Hawaiian 
Tropic. 

As we head into yet another steamy, 
sweltering summer locally in Washington, 
DC, and as Americans throughout 
the country hit the outdoors to 
enjoy a relaxing time at beaches, backyard 
barbeques and parks, we cannot 
forget how important it is to protect 
our skin from the sun’s damaging rays. 

However, I am profoundly disappointed 
to report that yet another 
summer is passing us by without adequate 
sunscreen labeling to protect 
consumers from harmful ultraviolet radiation, 
including UVA and UVB. 
Americans are being left in the lurch 
by the inaction of the Food and Drug 
Administration, which has failed to 
issue comprehensive and consistent 
standards for measuring and labeling 
sunscreen products for their protective 
value and for guarding against false 
claims on sunscreen products. 

Americans may be surprised to learn 
that the Sun Protection Factor, SPF, 
number on the sunscreen they buy at 
their local convenience store or supermarket 
measures only the level of UVB 
protection provided by the sunscreen. 
It does not include a measure of the 
level of UVA protection. UVB has long 
been associated with sunburn while 
UVA has been recognized as a deeper 
penetrating radiation that contributes 
to skin cancer. While many products 
claim to offer UVA protection, that 
claim is not backed by enforceable, 
FDA-recommended standards by which 
those claims can be substantiated. 

The FDA’s standards for sunscreen 
testing and labeling lag 30 years behind 
our knowledge of the dangers of sun exposure. 
Research tells us that individual 
risk of melanoma, the most serious 
form of skin cancer, is associated 
with the intensity of sunlight that a 
person receives over a lifetime. In 2008, 
it is estimated there will be more than 
1 million new cases of skin cancers and 
62,480 new cases of melanoma, the deadliest 
form of skin cancer. Tragically, 
there will be as many as 8,420 deaths 
from melanoma this year. 

Many sunscreen products carry 
claims that they protect against cancer-
causing UVA rays, but without 
FDA action to set standards for testing 
and labeling, these claims can’t be 
validated. Indeed, an analysis released 
earlier this summer found that many 
sunscreen products have misleading labels 
that make unsubstantiated claims. 

Senator JACK REED of Rhode Island 
and I, along with many of my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle, have 
repeatedly urged the FDA—for over a 
decade now—to follow through with its 


S8038 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

development of standards. We have 
written letters to the FDA dating back 
more than ten years, we have made 
phone calls, we have asked questions at 
hearings, and we even directed the 
FDA to issue final labeling for UVA 
and UVB in the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture 
Appropriations bill. 

The American Cancer Society, the 
American Academy of Dermatology, 
and numerous other organizations 
speak of the value of using sunscreen 
to protect our skin from damaging 
UVA and UVB rays as an important 
step in preventing skin cancer. For 
years, we have heard their repeated 
cries for industry-wide standards that 
will help Americans protect themselves 
from a preventable cause of cancer. 
And still there is no final action by the 
FDA. 

The public deserves better. If you 
take one look at the startling numbers 
of Americans who will be diagnosed 
with skin cancer this year and who will 
likely die from this disease, it is clear 
that the public must know that what 
they read on the label of a sunscreen 
product represents a scientifically 
valid claim of protection from both 
UVA and UVB radiation. 

Almost a year ago, the FDA issued a 
proposed rule that would set standards 
for testing and labeling sunscreen that 
includes UVA and UVB. I applaud this 
progress. It was a long time in coming. 
But I must reiterate that until the proposed 
rule is finalized, consumers and 
manufacturers lack an enforceable, 
consistent and comprehensive standard 
for testing and labeling of sunscreen 
products. 

That is why I am introducing the 
SUNscreen Labeling Protection Act of 
2008, or the SUN Act. This simple, 
straightforward bill gives the FDA 180 
days from the date of enactment to finalize 
the proposed rule for comprehensive 
labeling, including formulation, 
testing and labeling requirements for 
both UVA and UVB, after which point 
the proposed rule would become effective. 


I cannot emphasize enough the importance 
of this issue. The public continues 
to be misled by false claims that 
cannot be effectively challenged because 
there are no enforceable FDA 
standards for measuring and labeling 
UVA protection. 

If the FDA would finalize its proposed 
rule including UVA and UVB protection, 
this legislation would not be 
necessary. But, a year and an entire 
summer season has nearly passed since 
the rule was proposed, as have decades 
of inaction prior to the proposed rule 
even being issued. All the while, consumers 
have gone without the information 
and protection they need which is 
what makes this legislation so critical. 

I urge my colleagues to support this 
critically important bill. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that letters of support be printed 
in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be placed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 

CANCER ACTION NETWORK, 

July 30, 2008. 

Hon. CHRISTOPHER J. DODD, 

U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR DODD: On behalf of the volunteers 
and supporters of the American Cancer 
Society Cancer Action NetworksSM (ACS 
CAN), the partner advocacy organization of 
the American Cancer Society, we want to express 
our thanks for your leadership in introducing 
the Sunscreen Labeling Protection 
Act of 2008 (SUN Act). The SUN Act will direct 
the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) to issue final regulations related to 
labeling for sunscreen products. 

Skin cancer is the most common of all cancer 
types with more than one million skin 
cancer diagnoses each year in the United 
States. Because exposure to ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation from the sun is the most important 
known risk fact for skin cancers, we believe 
this long-awaited proposal from the FDA 
will better inform consumers on the value 
and limits of sunscreen use. 

We have provided extensive comments on 
the FDA proposed rules to ensure that the 
new regulations will require the most accurate 
and user-friendly presentation of sun 
protection possible on sunscreen products. 
The majority of skin cancers are caused primarily 
by UVB rays, and we know that UV 
exposure from the sun increases the risk of 
skin cancer, premature skin aging and other 
skin damage. Therefore, it is important to 
decrease UV exposure by wearing protective 
clothing, seeking shade whenever possible, 
and using a sunscreen with a high enough 
SPF Value to protect against some level of 
both UVB and UVA rays. ACS CAN believes 
that by raising the highest labeled sun protection 
factor (SPF) Value from 30 to 50 and 
including a UVA protection measure, consumers 
will be able to better select their protection 
level. 

ACS CAN views cancer prevention as the 
most important attribute of sunscreens, and 
there is now convincing evidence that consistent 
use of appropriate sunscreens will result 
in the prevention of squamous cell carcinoma 
of the skin and may lower melanoma 
risk. Hence it is our strong conviction that 
all sunscreen packages must note the importance 
of applying sunscreen before going into 
the sun and reapplying as needed. We hope 
the new FDA regulations will help to achieve 
this by requiring a principle display panel on 
packages that is simple and easy for consumers 
to read, so they have clear directions 
on sun safety to make the most appropriate 
choice about protection levels. 

Again, ACS CAN is encouraged that the 
SUN Act may finally lead to implementation 
of new regulations related to sunscreen labeling, 
and we look forward to working with 
Congress and the FDA to provide consumers 
with the most accurate and forthright information 
regarding sun protection and sunscreen 
use. If we can ever be of assistance or 
provide information, please contact Kelly 
Green Kahn, Associate Director, Federal Relations. 


Sincerely, 

DANIEL E. SMITH, 

President, 

DICK WOODRUFF, 

Senior Director, Federal 
Relations. 

CITIZENS FOR SUN PROTECTION, 

Washington, DC, July 30, 2008. 

Hon. CHRISTOPHER DODD, 

Russell Senate Office Building, 
Washington, DC. 

DEAR SENATOR DODD, On behalf of the Citizens 
for Sun Protection, an organization of 
parents, cancer survivors, healthcare professionals, 
business advocates and community 

leaders, joined together to advocate for 
stronger standards for sunscreen protection, 
I am writing you to express our strong support 
for the Sunscreen Labeling Protection 
Act of 2008 (SUN Act). This legislation would 
provide for the enactment within 180 days of 
the sunscreen standards rule that was first 
proposed by the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) in August 2007, and has yet been 
acted upon. We applaud your leadership in 
advancing federal sunscreen standards to 
protect Americans against cancer-causing 
UVB and UVA rays. 

The delay in upgrading U.S. sunscreen 
standards, which has dragged on for now 
close to 20 years, can no longer be tolerated. 
Several other countries, including the European 
Union, already have strong sunscreen 
standards that provide protection from both 
UVA and UVB rays for their citizens. Your 
legislation will assure that the FDA issues 
final standards for UVA and UVB protection 
within 180 days of enactment and thus provide 
Americans with vitally important protection 
against skin cancer, premature 
aging, and skin damage. 

A comprehensive FDA rule would require 
that sunscreen manufacturers properly label 
products so consumers will know the level of 
protection provided in the sunscreen they 
use for themselves and their families. Today, 
the average American using sunscreens that 
are commercially available in this country 
mistakenly believes that the product is providing 
equal protection for both UVB and 
UVA exposure. In reality Sun Protection 
Factor designations only apply only to UVB 
rays, those that primarily cause sunburn, 
and do not protect against UVA rays which 
cause skin cancer and other skin damage. 

Compelling facts drive the need for change: 
According to the American Cancer Society 
one million new cases of skin cancer will be 
diagnosed in the United States this year and 
over 10,000 Americans will die from the disease. 
Every year the FDA proposal is delayed 
leaves our citizens at increased risk. It is 
critical to the health and welfare of the U.S. 
public to have access to strong, protective 
sunscreens they can trust. On behalf of the 
Citizens for Sun Protection, I wish to once 
again affirm our strong support for the SUN 
Act. We applaud your efforts to establish 
strong standards and an accurate labeling 
system for UVA and UVB protection in the 
United States. 

Sincerely, 

ROBERT F. HURLEY, 

Executive Director. 

ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP, 

Washington, DC, July 30, 2008. 

Hon. CHRISTOPHER J. DODD, 

Chair, Subcommittee on Children and Families, 

Committee on Health, Education, Labor and 

Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 

DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: As the summer sun is 
upon us, we are again reminded of the need 
to ensure that sunscreens protect consumers 
from the damaging rays of both ultraviolet A 
(UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. 
The Food and Drug Administration first proposed 
to set safety standards in 1978, yet 
failed to act. That is why EWG supports the 
Sunscreen Labeling Protection Act of 2008, 
The SUN Act, which would require FDA to 
finalize sunscreen safety standards within 6 
months, ending 30 years of delay. 

The need for these standards is clear. A recent 
EWG study found that 85 percent of sunscreens 
that we tested do not offer enough 
protection from UV rays, are made with potentially 
harmful ingredients, or have not 
been tested for safety. Many products on the 
market present obvious safety and effectiveness 
concerns, including one of every seven 
that does not protect from UVA radiation. 
Overall we identified 143 products that offer 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8039 

very good sun protection with ingredients 
that present minimal health risks to users. 
Many sunscreens: lack UVA protection; 
break down in the sun; make questionable 
product claims, i.e. ‘‘waterproof’’; contain 
nano-scale materials that raise questions; 
and absorb into the blood. 

These problems are aggravated by the fact 
that FDA has not finalized comprehensive 
sunscreen safety standards, called the ‘‘Sunscreen 
Monograph,’’ they began drafting 30 
years ago. It took FDA 29 years to propose a 
Sunscreen Monograph. It has been nearly a 
year and it has yet to finalize the Monograph. 
EWG hopes it will do so quickly, but 
after 30 years of delay, we must ensure consumers 
get the protections they believe they 
are getting. 

We commend you for your continued leadership 
in this area and the introduction of 
The SUN Act. We look forward to working 
with you to ensure its quick passage. 

Sincerely, 

RICHARD WILES 

Executive Director. 

By Mr. REID (for Mr. KENNEDY 

(for himself, Mr. BINGAMAN, and 

Mr. SANDERS)): 

S. 3431. A bill to establish expanded 
learning time initiatives, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today, along with Senators KENNEDY 
and SANDERS, to introduce the Time for 
Innovation Matters in Education, or 
TIME Act, of 2008. This bill would improve 
and expand students’ instructional 
time, while ensuring rigorous 
standards, as a means to help close the 
academic achievement gap that exists 
for so many of our disadvantaged students. 


The fundamental principle underlying 
this bill is that the amount of instructional 
time provided by the vast 
majority of school calendars is simply 
inadequate for today’s students and 
teachers. Teachers need more time to 
plan and deliver instruction, and students 
need more time for 21st century 
learning. 

The demands on 21st century learners 
reflect the rapid increase in technological 
advances that we have all experienced 
in the last 30 or 40 years. Twenty 
first century learning demands an 
increase in the rigor of mathematics 
and science education, and the acquisition 
of subject area knowledge in areas 
that simply did not exist years ago, 
such as computer literacy. These increased 
demands should not be met at 
the expense of ignoring other subjects 
such as social studies, art, and physical 
education. Yet, these other areas are 
often ignored to allow for time for 
some of the major academic subjects. 
That is the consequence of failing to 
match the gradual increase in educational 
demands with a corresponding 
increase in instructional time. 

Instead, here we are in the 21st century, 
continuing to adhere to a school 
calendar that was established over 100 
years ago, and which was designed to 
accommodate a predominantly agricultural 
society. In nearly every State, 
the school calendar is based on approximately 
180 or fewer instructional 

days, or on approximately 1000 instructional 
hours, per school year. This 
means that American students are 
spending fewer than 20 percent of their 
waking hours in school. 

In the recent National Research 
Council report entitled, How People 
Learn, the authors comment on the importance 
of being realistic about the 
amount of time it takes to learn complex 
subject matter. Simply put, they 
note that ‘‘significant learning takes 
major investments of time.’’ The TIME 
Act is an initial investment that will 
provide teachers and students with the 
expanded opportunities they need to 
achieve high quality instruction and 
learning. We know that time needs are 
significant if our students are to 
achieve a 21st century education. 

Although all students are likely to 
benefit from expanded learning time, 
we must prioritize these opportunities 
for students who are most at risk for 
poor academic achievement. International 
reports like the PISA study 
demonstrate that although American 
students, as a group, have poor academic 
achievement relative to students 
in other industrialized nations, this 
disparity is most pronounced for students 
that are overrepresented among 
our Nation’s poor. In fact, the 2006 
PISA report shows that achievement 
scores for White, non-Hispanic students 
meet or exceed average scores reported 
across participating nations, whereas 
the average scores for Black or Hispanic 
students are well below that average. 


Likewise, although research has demonstrated 
that all students are at risk 
for losing educational gains during the 
extended summer breaks that are currently 
the norm for most schools, children 
from low income households experience 
significantly greater achievement 
losses during summer breaks because 
they lack opportunities to attend 
the quality summer programs available 
to their less disadvantaged peers. Each 
year, this disparity contributes to the 
growing achievement gap. Researchers 
have shown us that these out-of-school 
experiences account for most of the 
achievement difference observed by 9th 
grade, which in turn influences when 
and whether students will graduate 
from high school and attend postsecondary 
school. Investing in more time 
during the school year can help to diminish 
these achievement gaps, improve 
graduation rates, and make a 
lasting difference in these students’ 
lives. 

But effective expanded learning opportunities 
require more than just 
more time. The time must be well 
spent. Students must be appropriately 
engaged in their learning, and teachers 
must have the training and support to 
use the longer school time effectively. 
Researchers have identified that expanded 
learning time benefits teachers, 
by providing more opportunities for cooperative 
planning and more time to 
individualize instruction. Involved students 
and teachers are critical to suc


cessful expanded learning time programs, 
and both benefit from effective 
programming. 

States have begun to explore expanded 
learning programs, and have 
demonstrated their effectiveness. In 
Massachusetts, 10 schools converted 
their calendars to expand the mandatory 
number of school days and the 
number of hours within a school day. 
Outcomes include not only increased 
student achievement, but greater 
school satisfaction among parents, 
teachers, and students. In my own 
State of New Mexico, expanded learning 
initiatives have been pursued, in 
the form of longer school days or additional 
school days throughout the 
year. Early reports demonstrate increased 
achievement in math and reading, 
beyond grade-level expectations. 
Unfortunately, the funds available for 
these initiatives are limited to voluntary 
participation. We must make 
these programs become a regular part 
of the school day for all students and 
teachers, particularly those who are 
greatest risk for academic failure. 

Most districts and State educational 
agencies do not have the capacity or 
infrastructure to guide, support, and 
fund expanded learning day programs, 
but good models for turning around 
low-performing schools do exist. Federal 
support can be used to build 
States’ and schools’ capacity based on 
evidence from such models. 

Towards this goal, the TIME Act 
will: provide incentives for States and 
local educational agencies to develop 
plans for research-based, sustainable, 
and replicable expanded learning programs, 
for high-priority schools, with a 
focus on increasing rigorous and varied 
instructional opportunities for students 
and teachers; allow local educational 
agencies to determine appropriate 
objectives of their extended 
learning programs, such as increasing 
math and science scores for all students, 
enhance art or physical education, 
or increase academic English 
proficiency for English language learners; 
encourage States to take a leadership 
role and deliver technical assistance 
to schools that implement such 
programs; encourage schools to form 
partnerships with organizations that 
have successful track records in supporting 
or delivering effective expanded 
learning programs; and promote 
research on expanded learning 
program implementation, through 
local, State, and national data collection 
efforts. The results of these evaluations 
can inform best practices for 
future delivery of expanded learning 
models to additional schools. 

I would like to thank Chairman KENNEDY 
for his leadership on this legislation, 
and for his ongoing commitment 
to enhancing educational opportunities 
for all Americans; particularly our 
most disadvantaged youths. Moreover, 
Senator KENNEDY’s State of Massachusetts 
is a leader in school-wide expanded 
learning initiatives. Massachusetts 
has demonstrated that expanded 


S8040 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

learning enhances students’ success, 
and it has done so in formerly struggling 
schools in some of the State’s 
poorest school districts. 

The TIME Act expands upon these 
models of success by promoting similar 
initiatives across the country. I hope 
that this legislation will be incorporated 
into reauthorization of the Elementary 
and Secondary Education 
Act, and I urge my colleagues to support 
it. 

Like my colleagues Senator KENNEDY 
and SANDERS, I believe that all students 
deserve the time needed for a 
quality education. I also believe that 
all schools should expand well beyond 
their current limited calendar, especially 
if America is to maintain and increase 
its competitive edge in the global 
economy. We must invest in a systematic 
approach to improving schools 
so that every child graduates prepared 
for success. The TIME Act is an initial 
investment toward this goal. 

By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. 

HAGEL, Mr. CASEY, Mr. 

VOINOVICH, and Mr. WEBB): 

S. 3433. A bill to ensure that any 
agreement with Iraq containing a security 
commitment or arrangement is 
concluded as a treaty or is approved by 
Congress; to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations. 
Mr. BIDEN. Today I join a bipartisan 
group of Senators in introducing the 
Iraq Security Agreement Act of 2008. 
This bill, consistent with the Constitution 
of the United States, prohibits the 
Bush administration from entering 
into a binding security agreement with 
Iraq without the approval of Congress. 
It would also prohibit the obligation of 
any funds to implement such an agreement. 


I regret that I am compelled to introduce 
this legislation. If the President 
had embarked on these negotiations in 
a more responsible manner—by being 
clear about the objective, by ensuring 
that the agreements would not tie the 
hands of the next administration, by 
actively consulting with Congress as a 
partner in the process—this bill would 
be unnecessary. But the Administration 
has done none of these things, and 
so my colleagues and I want to ensure 
that Congress, and thus the American 
people, is brought into the process. 

Let me take a step back and summarize 
how we got to this point. From October 
2003 until the present day, the 
American military presence in Iraq has 
been authorized under international 
law through a series of UN Security 
Council Resolutions. Last November, 
President Bush and Prime Minister 
Maliki signed a ‘‘Declaration of Principles,’’ 
which set out a framework for 
our countries to negotiate, by yesterday—
July 31, 2008—agreements governing 
cooperation in the political, 
economic and security spheres. The 
Declaration indicated that the two 
countries would not seek to renew the 
United Nations mandate for American 
troops in Iraq past December 31, 2008. 

Among other things, the Declaration 
contemplates ‘‘providing security assurances 
and commitments to the Republic 
of Iraq to deter foreign aggression 
against Iraq’’ and supporting Iraq 
‘‘in its efforts to combat all terrorist 
groups,’’ including Al-Qaeda, 
Saddamists, and ‘‘all other outlaw 
groups regardless of affiliation.’’ In 
other words, all the folks fighting in 
Iraq and killing each other. 

The Declaration may result in two 
pacts. One would be a ‘‘Strategic 
Framework Agreement’’ that will ‘‘set 
the broad parameters of the overall bilateral 
relationship in every field,’’ according 
to the U.S. Ambassador to 
Iraq, Ryan Crocker. This might be better 
titled ‘‘What the United States will 
do for Iraq,’’ because it consists mostly 
of a series of promises that flow in one 
direction—promises by the United 
States to a sectarian government that 
has thus far failed to reach the political 
compromises necessary to build a 
stable country. 

The second agreement is a ‘‘Status of 
Forces Agreement’’ or SOFA, governing 
the presence of U.S. forces in 
Iraq, including their entry into the 
country and the immunities to be 
granted to them under Iraqi law. The 
administration claims that this agreement 
is mostly ‘‘routine’’ because we 
have SOFAs with over 90 countries 
around the globe. But conditions our 
soldiers face in Iraq are far from ‘‘routine,’’ 
despite recent improvements in 
security. Moreover, this SOFA would 
be much broader than the typical 
SOFA, from what we know. It would 
provide us with access to bases from 
which our military would operate, provisions 
that are usually in a separate 
facilities or ‘‘basing’’ agreement. This 
SOFA would also deal with contractor 
immunity, would permit U.S. forces to 
engage in combat operations in Iraq, 
and would provide authority for detaining 
insurgents. This is not a typical 
SOFA. 

One of these agreements will reportedly 
contain a ‘‘security arrangement’’—
a pledge by the United States 
to consult on next steps if Iraq is 
threatened. The Administration suggests 
that such an agreement is 
unremarkable, and that it does not 
bind the United States. But at a time 
when we have over 100,000 troops on the 
ground, an expansive program to train 
and equip Iraqi forces, and multiple 

U.S. military facilities, the pledge is, 
in reality, little different from a binding 
security commitment. Certainly, 
the government of Iraq and its people 
will perceive that we are signing up to 
defend Iraq against external threats. 
Yesterday’s deadline has apparently 
not been met. The New York Times reports, 
however, that the Bush administration 
and Iraqi government are close 
to an agreement. But Congress still remains 
largely in the dark. 

We have not seen draft language. We 
do not definitively know which portions 
of the agreement will be binding, 
and which will not be. We are not in a 

position to evaluate whether the agreement 
will create obligations—either 
legal or political—that will constrain 
the next administration, whether 
Democratic or Republican. The President 
cannot make such a sweeping 
commitment on his own authority. 
Congress must grant approval. The legislation 
we introduce today requires 
that Congress be made part of the process. 


I have often stated that no foreign 
policy can be sustained without the informed 
consent of the American people. 
More than 5 years ago, President 
Bush went to war in Iraq without gaining 
that consent—by overstating the 
intelligence and understating the difficulty, 
cost and duration of the mission. 


In the final months of his term, 
President Bush is once again acting 
without the informed consent of the 
American people, putting us on a 
course to commit the Nation to a new 
phase of a long war in Iraq, and thereby 
bind his successors to his vision of 

U.S. policy in Iraq. By these agreements, 
the President will make it harder 
for his successor to change course. 
Let me be clear. I support the concept 
of a Status of Forces Agreement 
with Iraq. But not at the cost of limiting 
our operational latitude or making 
security commitments—legal or 
political—that are not approved by 
Congress. 

Administration officials have indicated 
that the Iraqi government is resisting 
the inclusion of key provisions 
that U.S. forces need in order to operate 
in Iraq. Given the difficulty of securing 
Iraq’s consent to the broad authorities 
that the United States now 
has by virtue of the U.N. Security 
Council Resolutions, I believe the best 
option for the United States at this 
juncture is to seek an extension of the 
current United Nations Security Counsel 
resolution for Iraq. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the text of the bill be printed 
in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 

S. 3433 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Iraq Security 
Agreement Act of 2008’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 

Congress makes the following findings: 

(1) On November 26, 2007, President George 
W. Bush and Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-
Maliki signed the Declaration of Principles 
for a Long-Term Relationship of Cooperation 
and Friendship Between the Republic of Iraq 
and the United States of America (in this 
Act referred to as the ‘‘Declaration of Principles’’), 
with the goal of concluding a final 
agreement or agreements between the 
United States and Iraq by July 31, 2008, 
‘‘with respect to the political, cultural, economic, 
and security spheres.’’ 
(2) The Declaration of Principles contemplates 
the United States ‘‘providing security 
assurances and commitments to the Republic 
of Iraq to deter foreign aggression.’’ 

August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8041 

(3) In 1992, pursuant to section 1457 of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 1991 (50 U.S.C. 404c), the executive 
branch submitted a report to Congress on 
then-existing security commitments and arrangements. 
(4) The report described in paragraph (3) 
defined a ‘‘security commitment’’ as an ‘‘obligation, 
binding under international law, of 
the United States to act in the common defense 
in the event of an armed attack on 
that country.’’ The report noted that all current 
security commitments of the United 
States are ‘‘embodied in treaties which receive 
the advice and consent of the Senate.’’ 
(5) The report defined a ‘‘security arrangement’’ 
as a ‘‘pledge by the United States to 
take some action in the event of a threat to 
that country’s security. Security arrangements 
typically oblige the United States to 
consult with a country in the event of a 
threat to its security. They may appear in 
legally-binding agreements, such as treaties 
or executive agreements, or in political documents, 
such as policy declarations by the 
President, Secretary of State or Secretary of 
Defense.’’ 
(6) The United States Ambassador to Iraq, 
Ryan Crocker, has stated that the agreements 
to be concluded as anticipated by the 
Declaration of Principles will ‘‘deal with the 
status of U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq 
past 2008’’ and ‘‘set the broad parameters of 
the overall bilateral relationship in every 
field’’. 
(7) On November 26, 2007, Assistant to the 
President and Deputy National Security Advisor 
for Iraq and Afghanistan, Lieutenant 
General Douglas Lute, stated, ‘‘We don’t anticipate 
now that these negotiations [under 
the Declaration of Principles] will lead to ... 
formal inputs from Congress.’’ 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 

It is the sense of Congress that— 

(1) any agreement that sets forth the 
‘‘broad parameters of the overall bilateral 
relationship [as between the United States 
and the Republic of Iraq] in every field,’’ particularly 
one that includes a security commitment 
or arrangement provided to the Republic 
of Iraq by the United States, would result 
in serious military, political, and economic 
obligations for the United States, and 
thus, consistent with past practice, should 
involve a joint decision by the executive and 
legislative branches; and 
(2) a short-term extension of the mandate 
of the Multi-National Force in Iraq (currently 
provided by United Nations Security 
Council Resolution 1790 (2007)), would, in 
concert with Iraqi law, provide United States 
forces with the authorities, privileges, and 
immunities necessary for those forces to 
carry out their mission in Iraq.

the Secretary of Defense shall keep such 
committees fully and currently informed regarding 
the status of the negotiations. Prior 
to finalizing any agreement that includes a 
security commitment or security arrangement 
with Iraq, the Secretary of State

By Mr. DURBIN: 

S. 3434. A bill to combat organized 
crime involving the illegal acquisition 
of retail goods for the purpose of selling 
those illegally obtained goods 
through physical and online retail marketplaces; 
to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to 
discuss legislation that I am introducing 
today, the it Combating Organized 
Retail Crime Act of 2008. 

This bill addresses a persistent and 
growing problem that costs retailers 
billions of dollars and poses serious 
health and safety risks for consumers. 
Organized retail crime involves the coordinated 
theft of large numbers of 
items from retail stores with the intent 
to resell those items. Typically, 
crime organizations hire teams of pro


fessional shoplifters to steal over-the-
counter drugs, health and beauty aids, 
designer clothing, razor blades, baby 
formula, electronic devices and other 
items from retail stores. Using sophisticated 
means for evading anti-theft 
measures, and often the assistance of 
employees at stores, the thieves target 
10–15 stores per day. They steal thousands 
of dollars worth of items from 
each store and deliver the items to a 
processing and storage location. There, 
teams of workers sort the items, remove 
anti-theft tracking devices, and 
remove labels that identify the items 
with a particular store. In some instances, 
they change the expiration 
date, replace the label with that of a 
more expensive product, or dilute the 
product and repackage the modified 
contents in seemingly-authentic packaging. 
The items are then stored in a 
warehouse, often under poor conditions 
that result in the deterioration of the 
contents. 

Organized retail crime rings typically 
sell their stolen merchandise in 
different markets, including flea markets, 
swap-meets, and online auction 
sites. Online sales are of particular 
concern, since the internet reaches a 
worldwide market and allows sellers to 
operate anonymously and maximize return. 
A growing number of multi-million 
dollar organized retail crime cases 
involve internet sales. For example, in 
Florida recently law enforcement 
agents arrested 20 people in a $100 million 
case involving the sale of stolen 
health and beauty aids on an online 
auction site and at flea markets. 

Organized retail crime has a variety 
of harmful effects. Retailers and the 
FBI estimate that it costs retailers billions 
of dollars in revenues and costs 
states hundreds of millions of dollars 
in sales tax revenues. With respect to 
certain products, such as baby formula 
and diabetic test strips, improper storage 
and handling by thieves creates a 
serious public safety risk when the 
products are resold. The proceeds of organized 
retail crime are often used to 
finance other forms of criminal behavior, 
including gang activity and drug 
trafficking. 

The Combating Organized Retail 
Crime Act would address this problem 
in several ways. First, it would toughen 
the criminal code’s treatment of organized 
retail crime by refining certain 
offenses to capture conduct that is currently 
being committed by individuals 
engaged in organized retail crime, and 
by requiring the U.S. Sentencing Commission 
to consider relevant sentencing 
guideline enhancements. 

Second, the bill would require physical 
retail marketplaces, such as flea 
markets, and online retail marketplaces, 
such as auction websites, to review 
the account of a seller and file a 
suspicious activity report with the Justice 
Department when presented with 
documentary evidence showing that 
the seller is selling items that were illegally 
obtained. If the physical or on-
line retail marketplace is presented 


S8042 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

with clear and convincing evidence 
that the seller is engaged in such illegal 
activity, it must terminate the activities 
of the seller. This requirement 
will lead to greater cooperation between 
retail marketplaces, retailers 
and law enforcement, and will result in 
an increased number of organized retail 
crime prosecutions. 

Third, the bill would require high-
volume sellers on online auction sites 
(meaning sellers that have obtained at 
least $10,000 in annual gross revenues 
on the site) to display a physical address, 
post office box, or private mail 
box registered with a commercial mail 
receiving agency. This requirement 
will help online buyers get in touch 
with sellers, and assist law enforcement 
agents who wish to identify people 
who may be selling stolen goods on-
line. It is analogous to a provision in 
the federal CAN–SPAM Act, which also 
requires persons who send mass emails 
to disclose their physical addresses. 

This legislation has broad support in 
the retail industry in my home state of 
Illinois and nationwide. It is supported 
by the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, 
the National Retail Federation, 
the Retail Industry Leaders Association, 
the Food Marketing Institute, 
the National Association of Chain Drug 
Stores, and the Coalition to Stop Organized 
Retail Crime, whose members include 
such retail giants as Home 
Depot, Target, Wal-Mart, Safeway, 
Walgreens, and Macy’s. 

In summary, the Combating Organized 
Retail Crime Act addresses a serious 
problem that hurts businesses 
that are struggling to survive in a 
weak economy, and that harms consumers 
who unknowingly purchase stolen 
items that have been subjected to 
tampering. It heightens the penalties 
for organized retail crime, shuts down 
criminals who are selling stolen goods, 
and places valuable information about 
illegal activity into the hands of law 
enforcement. This bill is a big step forward 
in the fight against a nationwide 
problem, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the text of the bill be printed 
in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 

S. 3434 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Combating 
Organized Retail Crime Act of 2008’’. 

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 

Congress finds the following: 

(1) Organized retail crime involves the coordinated 
acquisition of large volumes of retail 
merchandise by theft, embezzlement, 
fraud, false pretenses, or other illegal means 
from commercial entities engaged in interstate 
commerce, for the purpose of selling or 
distributing such illegally obtained items in 
the stream of commerce. Organized retail 
crime is a growing problem nationwide that 
costs American companies and consumers 
billions of dollars annually and that has a 
substantial and direct effect upon interstate 
commerce. 

(2) The illegal acquisition and black-market 
sale of merchandise by persons engaged 
in organized retail crime result in an estimated 
annual loss of hundreds of millions of 
dollars in sales and income tax revenues to 
State and local governments. 
(3) The illegal acquisition, unsafe tampering 
and storage, and unregulated redistribution 
of consumer products such as baby 
formula, over-the-counter drugs, and other 
items by persons engaged in organized retail 
crime pose a health and safety hazard to consumers 
nationwide. 
(4) Investigations into organized retail 
crime have revealed that the illegal income 
resulting from such crime often benefits persons 
and organizations engaged in other 
forms of criminal activity, such as drug trafficking 
and gang activity. 
(5) Items obtained through organized retail 
crime are resold in a variety of different 
marketplaces, including flea markets, swap 
meets, open-air markets, and Internet auction 
websites. Increasingly, persons engaged 
in organized retail crime use Internet auction 
websites to resell illegally obtained 
items. The Internet offers such sellers a 
worldwide market and a degree of anonymity 
that physical marketplace settings do not 
offer. 
SEC. 3. OFFENSES RELATED TO ORGANIZED RETAIL

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. ROCKEFELLER, Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE, Mr. HAGEL, Mr. 
FEINGOLD, and Mr. WYDEN): 

S. 3437. A bill to limit the use of certain 
interrogation techniques, to require 
notification of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross of detainees, 
to prohibit interrogation by contractors, 
and for other purposes; to the 
Select Committee on Intelligence. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, 
today, Senators ROCKEFELLER, 
WHITEHOUSE, HAGEL, FEINGOLD and I introduce 
legislation to end coercive interrogations 
and secret detentions by 
the Central Intelligence Agency. 

These practices have brought shame 
to our Nation, have harmed our ability 
to fight the war on terror, and, I believe, 
violate U.S. law and international 
treaty obligations. 

It is time to repudiate torture and secret 
disappearances. It is time to end 
the outsourcing of coercive interrogations 
to the lowest bidder. It is time to 
return to the norms and values that 
have driven the United States to greatness 
for decades, but have been tarnished 
in the past 7 years. 

It is now public knowledge that the 
Bush administration, in the Vice President’s 
words, turned to ‘‘the dark 
side.’’ The ‘‘gloves came off.’’ In the 
name of counterterrorism, the CIA resorted 
to waterboarding—an interrogation 
technique invented in the Spanish 
Inquisition to force false confessions 
and punish enemies. 

In a mistaken effort to gain better 
intelligence, the CIA used this same 
technique that the Justice Department 
has prosecuted and the State Department 
has decried overseas. The administration 
used warped logic and faulty 
reasoning to say waterboarding technique 
was not torture. It is. 

Waterboarding is the only technique 
to be publicly confirmed by this administration. 
There are others that have 
not been acknowledged but are still authorized 
for use. This has to end. 

But we will never turn this sad page 
in our Nation’s history until all coercive 
techniques are banned, and are replaced 
with a single, clear, uniform 
standard across the United States Government. 


That standard is the one set out in 
the Army Field Manual. Its techniques 
work for the military and for the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation. If the CIA 
would abide by its terms, it would 
work for the CIA as well. 

The first provision in this legislation 
requires the Intelligence Community 
to follow the Army Field Manual. That 
is already the law for the Department 
of Defense. 

It is supported by 43 retired generals 
and admirals and by a bipartisan group 
of former Secretaries of State and Defense, 
Ambassadors, and national security 
advisors. 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8045 

Majorities in both houses of Congress 
passed this provision earlier this year, 
sending a clear message that we do not 
support coercive interrogations. Regrettably, 
the President’s veto stopped 
it from becoming law. 

The second provision in this legislation 
requires that access to any detainee 
being held by the intelligence 
community be provided to members of 
the International Committee of the 
Red Cross. 

Access by the ICRC is a hallmark of 
international law and is required by 
the Geneva Conventions. We believe 
that granting access to the ICRC is the 
best way to ensure that the same right 
will be afforded to U.S. forces if they 
are ever captured overseas. 

But ICRC access has been denied at 
CIA black sites in the war on terror. 
This has, in part, opened the door to 
the abuses in detainee treatment. Independent 
access prevents abuses like we 
witnessed at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo 
Bay. It is time that the same 
protection is in place for the CIA as 
well, in the well-established rules that 
the military has used for years. 

Finally, this legislation contains a 
ban on contractor interrogators at the 
CIA. As General Hayden has testified, 
the CIA uses outside contractors to 
conduct these interrogations. 

We should not be using coercive interrogation 
techniques at all. But I 
firmly believe that outsourcing these 
interrogations to private companies is 
a way to diminish accountability and 
to avoid getting the Agency’s hands 
dirty. I also believe that the use of contractors 
leads to more brutal interrogations 
than if they were done by Government 
employees. 

We remain a nation at war, and credible, 
actionable intelligence remains a 
cornerstone of our war effort. But that 
is not what the CIA detention and interrogation 
program has provided. 

Every single experienced interrogator 
tells us that coercive techniques 
will get someone to say what the interrogator 
wants to hear. But that doesn’t 
make it true. 

In fact, coercive interrogations and 
the threat of torture produced the information 
that Saddam Hussein was 
providing al Qaeda with WMD training. 
That wasn’t true, but it helped lead us 
to war in Iraq. 

Military and FBI interrogators also 
tell us that when they build a rapport 
with a detainee, they get more information, 
and more valuable information, 
than when it is coerced. 

Beyond that, our Nation has paid an 
enormous price because of these interrogations. 
They cast shadow and doubt 
over our ideals and our system of justice. 
Our enemies have used our practices 
to recruit more extremists. Our 
key global partnerships, crucial to winning 
the war on terror, have been 
strained. 

Look at two of our closest allies in 
the world. The British Parliament no 
longer trusts U.S. assurances that we 
will not torture detainees. The Cana


dian Government recently added the 
United States to its list of nations that 
conduct torture. 

This is not the country that we want 
to be. Torture and disappearances do 
not befit the nation that I know. 

It is time to restore America’s integrity. 


It will take time to resume our place 
as the world’s beacon of liberty and 
justice. This bill will put us on that 
path and start the process. I urge its 
passage. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the text of the bill be printed 
in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 

S. 3437 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives

America’s Integrity Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 

In this Act: 

(1) INSTRUMENTALITY.—The term ‘‘instrumentality’’, 
with respect to an element of 
the intelligence community, means a contractor 
or subcontractor at any tier of the 
element of the intelligence community. 
(2) INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.—The term 
‘‘intelligence community’’ has the meaning 
given that term in section 3(4) of the National 
Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401a(4)). 
SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES. 


No individual in the custody or under the 
effective control of personnel of an element 
of the intelligence community or instrumentality 
of an element of the intelligence community, 
regardless of nationality or physical 
location of such individual or personnel, 
shall be subject to any treatment or technique 
of interrogation not authorized by the 
United States Army Field Manual on Human 
Intelligence Collector Operations. 

SEC. 4. NOTIFICATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL

By Ms. LANDRIEU: 

S. 3438. A bill to prohibit the use of 
funds for the establishment of National 
Marine Monuments unless certain requirements 
are met; to the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 


Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I introduce 
this bill today to prevent misuse 
of the Antiquities. Act of 1906 to 
create very large marine monuments. 
The Antiquities Act was intended to 
protect landmarks, not create the largest 
protected areas in the United 
States unilaterally without congressional 
assent. 

The Bush administration acted covertly 
to convey protected status to 
139,000 square miles of the northwestern 
Hawaiian Islands. In so doing, 
the administration short-circuited the 
extensive Marine Sanctuaries process 
that was already underway and notified 
the delegation only after the press 
conference. Now they have turned their 
attention to the Gulf of Mexico. 

We learned that the President, with 
mixed support from his top advisors, is 
considering using his authorities under 
the Antiquities Act to unilaterally and 
permanently declare ‘‘marine monuments’’ 
in various locations of the U.S. 
Exclusive Economic Zone. Some of 
these areas are in my backyard—in the 
Gulf of Mexico—but other areas of the 
Atlantic and Pacific are also under 
consideration. 

I certainly understand the need to 
conserve and appropriately manage our 
most sensitive and vulnerable marine 
areas, which can serve as nurseries for 
fish stocks and provide critical habitat 
for other important species. That is 
why I support the processes Congress 
established in the National Marine 
Sanctuaries Act. But any declarations 
of new or additional protected status 
to marine areas should continue to follow 
the scientific and public processes 
outlined in the Sanctuaries Act. This is 
a good process that allows all affected 
parties—from the environmental community 
to recreational fishermen to 
the oil and gas industries—to have a 
say. 

By Ms. LANDRIEU: 

S. 3447. A bill to reprogram $15,000,000 
in savings in the Jackson Barracks 
military construction to the Department 
of the Interior for the Historic 
Preservation Fund of the National 
Park Service for the purpose of restoring 
Jackson Barracks to its pre-Hurricane 
Katrina status as a national historic 
treasure; to the Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources. 
Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I introduce 
this bill today to restore historic 
Jackson Barracks in New Orleans 
to its pre-Hurricane Katrina status as a 
national historic treasure. Jackson 
Barracks represents the rich military 
history of New Orleans, and indeed our 
great State. However, the rebuilding of 
the structures on this significant garrison 
has been hindered by bureaucratic 
roadblocks and gaps in funding. This 
bill directly addresses those challenges. 


As you know, Hurricane Katrina 
brought torrential floods and driving 


S8046 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008 

winds to New Orleans and the surrounding 
region. The devastation from 
the storm touched every structure at 
Jackson Barracks. The original Jackson 
Barracks consists of 14 Antebellum 
Garrison Structures built between 1834 
and 1835. These historic buildings were 
not spared and suffered tremendous 
damage. 

There is a pressing need to complete 
the restoration and renovation of the 
barracks. Jackson Barracks requires 
additional renovations and restorations 
that are not within the scope of 
the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency hurricane restoration funding. 
With the agreement of the Chief, National 
Guard Bureau and the Secretary 
of the Interior, this bill would reprogram 
the savings from several military 
construction projects elsewhere on 
Jackson Barracks to assist in the completion 
of historic preservation at the 
post. 

I ask the support of my colleagues in 
enabling the National Park Service to 
aid in the restoration of Jackson Barracks 
through the Historic Preservation 
Fund. I am not asking for additional 
dollars, but rather that the 
money that was saved on previous 
projects be recommitted and used for 
this vital need. 

By Ms. LANDRIEU: 

S. 3448. A bill to reauthorize the Cane 
River National Heritage Area Commission 
and expand the boundaries of the 
Cane River National Heritage Area in 
the State of Louisiana; to the Committee 
on Energy and Natural Resources. 
Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce legislation to reauthorize 
the Cane River National Heritage 
Area Commission and modify the 
boundaries of the heritage area. In 1994, 
Congress recognized this area as one of 
the nation’s cultural and historic 
treasures. In the 1700s, Creole culture 
flowered across the stunning landscapes 
of the Cane River, and the Creole 
culture continues to enliven the region 
to this day. In terms of beauty, it 
is not only the landscape but the Creole 
architecture from that time period 
that charms visitors. Today, the 35 
mile region includes the Cane River 
Creole National Historical Park, seven 
national historic landmarks, three 
state historic sites, and 24 properties 
listed on the National Register of Historic 
Places. 

Anchored by the city of 
Natchitoches, which traces its history 
to a French colonial settlement established 
in 1714 near the Natchitoches Indian 
village on the Red River, the region’s 
colonial forts, Creole plantations, 
churches, cemeteries, archeological 
sites, historic transportation 
routes, and commercial centers provide 
a unique view into Louisiana’s past. 

I am proud to represent the people of 
Louisiana by asking the 110th Congress 
to reauthorize this National Heritage 
Area and reaffirm the importance of 
the Cane River Creole culture as a na


tionally significant element of American 
heritage. 

This should not be a difficult task. 
Congress has once before agreed to establish 
a Cane River Creole National 
Historical Park to serve as the focus of 
interpretive and educational programs 
on the history of the Cane River area 
and to assist in the preservation of certain 
historic sites along the river. Now, 
I ask this Congress to do it again by reauthorizing 
the Cane River National 
Heritage Area. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the text of the bill be printed 
in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows:

S. 3449. A bill to direct the Secretary 
of the Interior to study the suitability 
and feasibility of designating sites in 
the Lower Mississippi River Area in 
the State of Louisiana as a unit of the 
National Park System, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Energy 
and Natural Resources. 
Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce legislation entitled 
the Lower Mississippi River National 
Historic Site Study Act. This bill will 
direct the Secretary of the Interior to 
study the suitability and feasibility of 
designating sites in Plaquemines Parish 
along the Lower Mississippi River 
Area as a unit of the National Park 
System. To be eligible for favorable 
consideration as a unit of the National 
Park System, an area must possess nationally 
significant natural, cultural or 
recreational resources. The Lower Mississippi 
River area in Plaquemines Parish 
meets and exceeds these criteria. 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8047 

I am proud to come to the floor today 
to introduce this bill. Anyone who has 
visited Plaquemines Parish knows that 
it is one of the Nation’s unique treasures. 
The natural beauty there at the 
mouth of the Mississippi is impossible 
to describe, but impossible not to love. 
The area is rich in history, and it is a 
preserve for one of the nation’s most 
unique cultural me´langes. 

That mix began after the Native 
Americans in the region began to intermingle 
with the Spanish explorers who 
traveled along the banks of the river in 
the 1500s. In 1682, Rene´-Robert Cavelier 
de LaSalle claimed all the land drained 
by the Mississippi for France area. In 
1699, the area became the site of the 
first fortification on the Lower Mississippi 
River, known as Fort Mississippi. 
Since then, it has been the 
home to 10 different fortifications, including 
Fort St. Philip and Fort Jackson. 


Fort St. Philip, originally built in 
1749, proved to be instrumental during 
the Battle of New Orleans by blocking 
the British Navy from going up river. 
Fort Jackson was built at the request 
of General Andrew Jackson and partially 
constructed by famous local 
Civil War General P.G.T. Beauregard. 
This fort was the site of the famous 
Civil War battle know as the ‘‘Battle of 
Forts’’ which is also referred to as the 
‘‘night the war was lost.’’ 

As this glimpse of the region’s military 
history shows, the Lower 
Plaquemines region is of national cultural 
and historical significance. 

There are also many other important 
and unique attributes to this area. This 
area is home to the longest continuous 
river road and levee system in the U.S. 
It is also home to the ancient Head of 
Passes site, Plaquemines Bend, geological 
features and two national wildlife 
refuges. 

Finally, the area has a rich cultural 
heritage. Over the years, many different 
cultures have made this area 
home including Creoles, Europeans, Indians, 
Yugoslavs, African-Americans 
and Vietnamese. These cultures have 
worked together to create the infrastructure 
for transportation of our Nation’s 
energy which is being produced 
by these same people out in the Gulf of 
Mexico off our shores. They have also 
created a fishing industry that contributes 
to Louisiana’s economy. 

I think it is easy to see why this area 
would make an excellent addition to 
the National Park Service. I hope that 
my colleagues will join me in supporting 
this bill which simply allows 
the National Park Service to study the 
suitability and feasibility of bringing 
this area into the system. I look forward 
to working with my colleagues to 
quickly enact this bill. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the text of the bill be printed 
in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 

S. 3449 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Lower Mississippi 
River National Historic Site Study 
Act of 2008’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 

Congress finds that— 

(1) the Lower Mississippi area located 
south of New Orleans, Louisiana, which is 
known as ‘‘Plaquemines Parish’’, has great 
historical significance; 
(2) from the earliest Spanish explorers 
traveling along the banks of the Lower Mississippi 
River in the 1500’s, to Robert de La-
Salle claiming all of the land drained by the 
Lower Mississippi River in 1682, to the petroleum, 
fisheries, and transportation industries 
of today, the area is one of the most 
unique areas in the continental United 
States; 
(3) while, in 1699, the area became the site 
of the first fortification on the Lower Mississippi 
River, known as ‘‘Fort Mississippi’’, 
it has since been home to 10 different fortifications, 
more than a dozen light houses, 
and several wildlife refuges, quarantine stations, 
and pilot stations; 
(4) of particular interest to the area are— 
(A) Fort St. Philip, originally built in 1749, 
at which, during the Battle of New Orleans, 
the British navy was blocked from going up 
river and a victory for the Colonial Army 
was ensured; and 
(B) Fort Jackson, built across from Fort 
St. Philip at the request of General Andrew 
Jackson and partially constructed by famous 
local Civil War General P.G.T. Beauregard, 
which was the site of the famous Civil War 
battle known as the ‘‘Battle of the Forts’’, 
which is also referred to as the ‘‘night the 
war was lost’’; 
(5) the area is— 
(A) at the end of the longest continuous 
river road and levee system in the United 
States; and 
(B) a part of the River Road highway system; 
(6) lower Plaquemines Parish is split down 
the middle by the Mississippi River, surrounded 
on 3 sides by the Gulf of Mexico, and 
crossed by numerous bayous, canals, and 
ditches; 
(7) Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip are located 
on— 
(A) an ancient Head of Passes site; and 
(B) 1 of the most historic areas on the 
Lower Mississippi River known as 
‘‘Plaquemines Bend’’; 
(8) the modern Head of Passes is only 21 
miles south of Fort Jackson and Fort St. 
Philip where the Mississippi River splits into 
a bird foot delta to travel the last 20 miles to 
the Gulf of Mexico; 
(9) there are numerous geological features 
that are unique to a large river mouth or 
delta that could make a national park in the 
area a particularly intriguing attraction; 
(10) the coastal erosion, subsidence, river 
hydraulics, delta features, fresh, salt, and 
brackish water marshes, and other unique 
features of the area could be an effective 
classroom for the public on the challenges of 
protecting our river and coastal zones; 
(11) the area includes the beginning of the 
Mississippi River flyway, which is— 
(A) 1 of the most pristine eco-sites in the 
United States; and 
(B) the site of 2 national wildlife refuges 
and 1 state wildlife refuge; 
(12) the area is culturally diverse in history, 
population, industry, and politics; 
(13) many well-known characters lived or 
performed deeds of great notoriety in the 
area; 
(14) in the area, Creoles, Europeans, Indians, 
Yugoslav, African-Americans, and Vietnamese 
all worked together to weave an interesting 
history of survival and success in a 
very treacherous environment; 
(15) the area has tremendous tourism potential, 
particularly for historical tourism 
and eco-tourism, because of the location, 
pristine ecosystems, and past indifference of 
the local government to promote tourism in 
the area; and 
(16) since Hurricane Katrina, the local government 
in the area has— 
(A) passed a resolution strongly supporting 
a national park study; and 
(B) shown an interest in developing tourism 
in the area.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 

SENATE RESOLUTION 643—CALLING 
FOR GREATER DIALOGUE 
BETWEEN THE DALAI LAMA AND 
THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA REGARDING 
RIGHTS FOR THE PEOPLE 
OF TIBET, AND FOR OTHER 
PURPOSES 

Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. 
FEINGOLD) submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 

S. RES. 643 
Whereas, on April 25, 2008, China’s official 
news agency Xinhua expressed the willingness 
of the Government of China to meet 
with envoys of the Dalai Lama; 
Whereas, on May 4, 2008, Special Envoy of 
His Holiness the Dalai Lama Lodi Gyari and 
Envoy Kelsang Gyaltsen met with Chinese 
Executive Vice Minister Zhu Weiqun and Executive 
Vice Minister Sithar for one day of 
talks, in which the Government of China alleged 
that the Dalai Lama instigated the 
March 2008 unrest in autonomous Tibetan 
areas of China, and was sabotaging the 
Olympic Games; 
Whereas Hu Jintao, General Secretary of 
the Communist Party of China, released a 
statement after this meeting saying that his 
Government of China was committed to a 
‘‘serious’’ dialogue with the Dalai Lama; 
Whereas, at the United States-European 
Union (EU) Summit on June 10, 2008, the 
United States and the European Union 
issued a joint statement welcoming the decision 
by the Government of China to hold 
talks with representatives of the Dalai 
Lama, and urged ‘‘both parties to move forward 
with a substantive, constructive and 
results-oriented dialogue at an early date’’; 
Whereas the Envoys of His Holiness the 
Dalai Lama’s Kelsang Gyaltsen and Lodi 
Gyari visited Beijing from June 30 to July 3, 
2008, to conduct the seventh round of the Tibetan-
Chinese dialogue; 
Whereas, during these talks, the Government 
of China issued a new set of demands, 
including that the Dalai Lama prove that he 
does not support Tibetan independence or 
disruption of the Olympic Games in Beijing; 
Whereas the Dalai Lama has stated multiple 
times he does not favor the independence 
of Tibet and is instead seeking negotiations 
to address the legitimate grievances of, 
and provide genuine autonomy for, the Tibetan 
people within the People’s Republic of 
China, and is committed to non-violence; 
Whereas the Dalai Lama has repeatedly 
and publicly declared his support for the 
Olympic Games in China, as well as his intention 
to attend the opening ceremony, if 
invited; 
Whereas, at the conclusion of the July 
round of talks, officials of the Government of 
China did not accept a proposal by the representatives 
of the Dalai Lama to agree to a 
joint statement supporting a continuation of 
the dialogue process; 
Whereas Special Envoy Lodi Gyari said on 
July 5, 2008, that the talks with the Government 
of China, called for by the international 
community, were ‘‘disappointing 
and difficult’’; 
Whereas, in contrast to the opinion of Special 
Envoy Lodi Gyari, President George W. 
Bush said on July 6, 2008, that ‘‘it looks like 
there’s some progress, at least in the talks 
with the Dalai Lama’’; 
Whereas officials of the Government of 
China subsequently stated that the talks 
with the Dalai Lama’s envoys are only about 
the Dalai Lama’s personal future, rather 
than about the future of Tibet; 

Whereas the Office of the Dalai Lama on 
July 17, 2008, restated its position that the 
talks are about ‘‘the future of 6,000,000 Tibetans 
in Tibet and not His Holiness the Dalai 
Lama’’; 

Whereas, on July 11, 2008, the European 
Parliament adopted a resolution that ‘‘welcomes 
the resumption of contacts, after the 
events of March 2008 in Lhasa, between the 
representatives of the Dalai Lama and the 
Chinese authorities’’ and ‘‘encourages the 
two parties to intensify these contacts so as 
to establish the bases for mutual trust, without 
which it will be impossible to arrive at a 
mutually acceptable political solution’’; 

Whereas, on the official stage during the 
Olympic torch’s relay through Lhasa on 
June 21, 2008, China’s Communist Party chief 
in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), 
Zhang Qingli, said, ‘‘Tibet’s sky will never 
change and the red flag with five stars will 
forever flutter high above it. . . . [W]e will 
certainly be able to totally smash the 
splittist schemes of the Dalai Lama clique.’’; 

Whereas, in reference to Zhang Qingli, the 
International Olympics Committee said in a 
rare rebuke that it ‘‘regrets that political 
statements were made during the closing 
ceremony of the torch relay in Tibet’’; and 

Whereas China’s People’s Armed Police 
troops have been sent to monasteries in Tibetan 
areas to give monks ‘‘relevant information’’ 
about the Olympics, and Chinese 
authorities have stepped up ‘‘patriotic education’’ 
campaigns designed to conform the 
religious practices of Tibetan Buddhists to 
Communist Party rules, including forcing 
monks and nuns to denounce the Dalai 
Lama: Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) urges the Dalai Lama or his representatives 
and the Government of the People’s Republic 
of China to begin earnest negotiations, 
without preconditions, to provide for a 
mutually agreeable solution that addresses 
the legitimate grievances of, and provides 
genuine autonomy for, the Tibetan people; 
(2) urges that the talks in October 2008 between 
the Government of China and the 
Dalai Lama should focus on the welfare, cultural, 
political, and religious autonomy of 
the Tibetan people, and not on the person of 
the Dalai Lama; 
(3) affirms that the human rights of Tibetans 
and their right to practice religion free 
of government regulation is not an internal 
matter of any one country; 
(4) urges the President to take a more personal 
and engaged interest in the successful 
conclusion of these negotiations, both unilaterally 
and in coordination with United 
States allies; and 
(5) calls on the United States Government 
to press the Government of China— 
(A) to respect freedom of speech and freedom 
of association, as required by international 
law and as enshrined in the Constitution 
of China and to release those who 
have committed no crime other than peaceful 
protest; and 
(B) to end the ‘‘patriotic education’’ campaign 
against lay and clerical Tibetans and 
allow Tibetans to practice their religion 
freely. 
Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce a resolution with 
my colleague, Senator FEINGOLD, supporting 
the human rights and religious 
freedom of Tibetans. 

Last March, I was one of many people 
worldwide who watched as Tibetan 
demonstrations in China exploded into 
violence. These protests reflected long-
standing frustration with the harsh 
measures imposed on Tibetans by the 
Government of China. Among other 

harassment, Tibetans can be required 
to undergo propaganda-based ‘‘political 
education,’’ detained without judicial 
due process, and are forbidden from 
possessing pictures of the Dalai Lama. 
After the March 2008 unrest, much of 
the international community urged 
China and the Dalai Lama to enter a 
positive, results-based dialogue on the 
human rights of Tibetans living. Unfortunately, 
these pleas have apparently 
fallen on deaf ears in Beijing. After the 
latest round of Tibetan-Chinese dialogue 
from June 30 to July 3, the Tibetan 
representatives expressed disappointment 
that the two sides could 
not even agree on a joint resolution 
calling for more talks. Progress, it 
seems, has been almost non-existent. 

As a result, Senator FEINGOLD and I 
are introducing a resolution urging 
that the talks—real, results-oriented 
talks—continue. We also call for the 
United States to press the Government 
of China to make a serious commitment 
to the human rights and religious 
freedom of Tibetans living on its soil, 
and an end to forced ‘‘political education’’ 
of Tibetans. The aim of the 
dialogue between the Government of 
China and the Dalai Lama must include 
an end to harassment of lay and 
religious Tibetans, and genuine autonomy 
for ethnically Tibetan regions.

SENATE RESOLUTION 644—DESIGNATING 
SEPTEMBER 2008 AS 
‘‘NATIONAL CHILD AWARENESS 
MONTH’’ TO PROMOTE AWARENESS 
OF CHARITIES BENEFITTING 
CHILDREN AND YOUTH-
SERVING ORGANIZATIONS 
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED 
STATES AND RECOGNIZING EFFORTS 
MADE BY THESE CHARITIES 
AND ORGANIZATIONS ON 
BEHALF OF CHILDREN AND 
YOUTH AS A POSITIVE INVESTMENT 
IN THE FUTURE OF THE 
UNITED STATES 

Mr. BURR (for himself and Mrs. FEINSTEIN) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on the Judiciary: 

S.RES. 644 
Whereas millions of children and youth in 
the United States represent the hopes and 
future of the United States; 
Whereas numerous individuals, charities 
benefitting children, and youth-serving organizations 
that work with children and youth 
collaborate to provide invaluable services to 
enrich and better the lives of children and 
youth throughout the United States; 
Whereas raising awareness of and increasing 
support for organizations that provide 
access to healthcare, social services, education, 
the arts, sports, and other services 
will result in the development of character 
and the future success of children and youth; 
Whereas the President issued a proclamation 
on May 30, 2008, proclaiming June 1, 2008 
as ‘‘National Child’s Day’’ to demonstrate a 
commitment to the youth of the United 
States; 
Whereas September, as the school year begins, 
is a time when parents, families, teachers, 
school administrators, and communities 
increase their focus on children and youth 
throughout the United States; 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8049 

Whereas September is a time for the people 
of the United States to highlight and be 
mindful of the needs of children and youth; 

Whereas private corporations and businesses 
have joined with hundreds of national 
and local charitable organizations throughout 
the United States in support of a month-
long focus on children and youth; 

Whereas designating September 2008 as 
‘‘National Child Awareness Month’’ would 
recognize that a long-term commitment to 
children and youth is in the public interest,

SENATE RESOLUTION 646—RECOGNIZING 
AND SUPPORTING THE 
GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL 
RUNAWAY PREVENTION 
MONTH 

Mr. SHELBY (for himself and Mrs. 
LINCOLN) submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions: 

S. RES. 646 
Whereas the prevalence of running away 
from home and homelessness among youths 
is staggering, with studies suggesting that 
between 1,600,000 and 2,800,000 youths live on 
the streets of the United States each year; 
Whereas running away from home is widespread, 
and youths aged 12 to 17 are at a 
higher risk of becoming homeless than 
adults; 
Whereas youths who run away from home 
most often have been expelled from their 
homes by their families, have been physically, 
sexually, or emotionally abused at 
home, have been discharged by State custodial 
systems without adequate transition 
plans, or have been separated from their parents 
by death and divorce, are too poor to secure 
their own basic needs, and are ineligible 
or unable to access adequate medical or 
mental health resources; 
Whereas effective programs that support 
runaway youths and assist youths and their 
families in preventing youths from running 
away succeed because of partnerships created 
among families, community-based 
human service agencies, law enforcement 
agencies, schools, faith-based organizations, 
and businesses; 
Whereas preventing youths from running 
away from home and supporting youths in 
high-risk situations are priorities for families, 
communities, and the Nation; 
Whereas the future well-being of the 
United States is dependent on the opportunities 
provided for youths and families to acquire 
the knowledge, skills, and abilities 
necessary for youths to develop into safe, 
healthy, and productive adults; 
Whereas the National Network for Youth 
and its members advocate on behalf of runaway 
and homeless youths and provide an 
array of community-based support to address 
their critical needs; 
Whereas the National Runaway Switchboard 
provides crisis intervention and referrals 
to reconnect runaway youths with their 
families and to link youths to local resources 
that provide positive alternatives to 
running away from home; and 
Whereas the National Network for Youth 
and the National Runaway Switchboard are 
cosponsoring National Runaway Prevention 
Month in November 2008 to increase public 
awareness of the life circumstances of 
youths in high-risk situations, the need for 
safe, healthy, and productive alternatives to 
running away, and the resources and support 
available for youths, families, and communities: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes and 
supports the goals and ideals of National 
Runaway Prevention Month. 

SENATE RESOLUTION 647—DESIGNATING 
SEPTEMBER 9, 2008, AS 
‘‘NATIONAL FETAL ALCOHOL 
SPECTRUM DISORDERS AWARENESS 
DAY’’ 

Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. 
JOHNSON, Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. SPECTER, 
Mr. COLEMAN, Mr. STEVENS, and Mr. 
HATCH) submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on the Judiciary: 

S. RES. 647 
Whereas the term ‘‘fetal alcohol spectrum 
disorders’’ includes a broader range of conditions 
and therefore has replaced the term 
‘‘fetal alcohol syndrome’’ as the umbrella 
term describing the range of effects that can 
occur in an individual whose mother drank 
alcohol during pregnancy; 
Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders 
are the leading cause of cognitive disability 
in western civilization, including the United 
States, and are 100 percent preventable; 
Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders 
are a major cause of numerous social disorders, 
including learning disabilities, school 
failure, juvenile delinquency, homelessness, 
unemployment, mental illness, and crime; 
Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol 
syndrome is estimated at 1 out of 500 live 
births and the incidence rate of fetal alcohol 
spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of 
every 100 live births; 
Whereas, although the economic costs of 
fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are difficult 
to estimate, the cost of fetal alcohol syndrome 
alone in the United States was 
$5,400,000,000 in 2003 and it is estimated that 
each individual with fetal alcohol syndrome 
will cost taxpayers of the United States between 
$1,500,000 and $3,000,000 in his or her 
lifetime; 
Whereas, in February 1999, a small group of 
parents of children who suffer from fetal alcohol 
spectrum disorders came together with 
the hope that in 1 magic moment the world 
could be made aware of the devastating consequences 
of alcohol consumption during 
pregnancy; 
Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol 
Syndrome Awareness Day was observed 
on September 9, 1999; 
Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, 
the co-founder of the first International 
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, 
asked ‘‘What if . . . a world full of FAS/E 
[Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Effect] parents all 
got together on the ninth hour of the ninth 
day of the ninth month of the year and asked 
the world to remember that during the 9 
months of pregnancy a woman should not 
consume alcohol . . . would the rest of the 
world listen?’’; and 
Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth 
month of each year since 1999, communities 
around the world have observed International 
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness 
Day: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) designates September 9, 2008, as ‘‘National 
Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders 
Awareness Day’’; and 
(2) calls upon the people of the United 
States— 
(A) to observe National Fetal Alcohol 
Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day with appropriate 
ceremonies— 
(i) to promote awareness of the effects of 
prenatal exposure to alcohol; 
(ii) to increase compassion for individuals 
affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol; 
(iii) to minimize further effects of prenatal 
exposure to alcohol; and 
(iv) to ensure healthier communities 
across the United States; and 

S8050 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE August 1, 2008

the ninth hour of September 9, 2008, to remember 
that during the 9 months of pregnancy 
a woman should not consume alcohol.

SENATE RESOLUTION 648—RECOGNIZING 
THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE CROSSING OF THE 
NORTH POLE BY THE USS NAUTILUS 
(SSN 571) AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE 
IN THE HISTORY OF 
BOTH OUR NATION AND THE 
WORLD 

Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. 
LIEBERMAN, Mr. REED, and Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
committee on Armed Services: 

S. RES. 648 
Whereas the USS Nautilus (SSN 571), built 
and launched at Electric Boat in Groton, 
Connecticut, on January 21, 1954, was the 
first vessel in the world to be powered by nuclear 
power; 
Whereas the USS Nautilus overcame extreme 
difficulties of navigation and maneuverability 
while submerged under the polar 
ice, and became the first vessel to cross the 
geographic North Pole on August 3, 1958; 
Whereas the USS Nautilus continued on her 
voyage and became the first vessel to successfully 
navigate a course across the top of 
the world; 
Whereas the USS Nautilus, having claimed 
this historic milestone and returned home to 
Naval Submarine Base New London, continued 
to establish a series of naval records in 
her distinguished 25-year career, including 
being the first submarine to journey ‘‘20,000 
leagues under the sea’’; 
Whereas the USS Nautilus completed these 
significant and laudable achievements during 
a critical phase of the Cold War, providing 
a source of inspiration for Americans 
and raising the hopes of the Free World; 
Whereas the USS Nautilus was the first 
naval vessel in peacetime to receive the 
Presidential Unit Citation for its meritorious 
efforts in crossing the North Pole; 
Whereas Commander William R. Anderson 
of the United States Navy was awarded the 
Legion of Merit for his role in commanding 
the USS Nautilus during its historic voyage; 
Whereas the USS Nautilus and its contribution 
to world history was praised by a range 
of American Presidents, including President 
Harry Truman, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 
President Lyndon B. Johnson, President 
Jimmy Carter, and President Bill Clinton; 
and 
Whereas President Eisenhower described 
the voyage to the North Pole as a ‘‘magnificent 
achievement’’ from which ‘‘the entire 
free world would benefit’’: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) recognizes the historic significance of 
the journey to the North Pole undertaken by 
the USS Nautilus; 
(2) commends the officers and crew of the 
USS Nautilus on the 50th anniversary of their 
magnificent achievement; 
(3) recognizes the importance of the USS 
Nautilus’ journey to the North Pole as not 
only a military and scientific accomplishment, 
but also in confirming America’s longstanding 
interest in this vital region of the 
world; 
(4) commends the role of the USS Nautilus 
and the United States Submarine Force in 
protecting the interests of the free world 
during the Cold War; and 
(5) supports the continuing role of the 
United States Submarine Force in defending 
our Nation in the 21st century. 
SENATE RESOLUTION 649—DESIGNATION 
SEPTEMBER 18, 2008, 
AS ‘‘NATIONAL ATTENTION DEFICIT 
DISORDER AWARENESS 
DAY’’ 

Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mr. 
SMITH) submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on the Judiciary; 

S. RES. 649 
Whereas Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity 
Disorder (also known as ADHD or ADD), is a 
chronic neurobiological disorder that affects 
both children and adults, and can significantly 
interfere with the ability of an individual 
to regulate activity level, inhibit behavior, 
and attend to tasks in developmentally-
appropriate ways; 
Whereas ADHD can cause devastating consequences, 
including failure in school and 
the workplace, antisocial behavior, encounters 
with the criminal justice system, interpersonal 
difficulties, and substance abuse; 
Whereas ADHD, the most extensively studied 
mental disorder in children, affects an estimated 
3 to 7 percent (4,000,000) of young 
school-age children and an estimated 4 percent 
(8,000,000) of adults across racial, ethnic, 
and socio-economic lines; 
Whereas scientific studies indicate that between 
10 and 35 percent of children with 
ADHD have a first-degree relative with past 
or present ADHD, and that approximately 1/2 
of parents who had ADHD have a child with 
the disorder, suggesting that ADHD runs in 
families and inheritance is an important risk 
factor; 
Whereas despite the serious consequences 
that can manifest in the family and life experiences 
of an individual with ADHD, studies 
indicate that less than 85 percent of 
adults with the disorder are diagnosed and 
less than 1/2 of children and adults with the 
disorder receive treatment and, furthermore, 
poor and minority communities are particularly 
underserved by ADHD resources; 
Whereas the Surgeon General, the American 
Medical Association, the American Psychiatric 
Association, the American Academy 
of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the 
American Psychological Association, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, and 
the National Institutes of Mental Health, 
among others, recognize the need for proper 
diagnosis, education, and treatment of 
ADHD; 
Whereas the lack of public knowledge and 
understanding of the disorder play a significant 
role in the overwhelming numbers of 
undiagnosed and untreated cases of ADHD, 
and the dissemination of inaccurate, misleading 
information contributes as an obstacle 
for diagnosis and treatment; 
Whereas lack of knowledge combined with 
issues of stigma have a particularly detrimental 
effect on the diagnosis and treatment 
of the disorder; 
Whereas there is a need for education of 
health care professionals, employers, and 
educators about the disorder and a need for 
well-trained mental health professionals capable 
of conducting proper diagnosis and 
treatment activities; and 
Whereas studies by the National Institute 
of Mental Health and others consistently reveal 
that through proper comprehensive diagnosis 
and treatment, the symptoms of 
ADHD can be substantially decreased and 
quality of life can be improved: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) designates September 18, 2008, as ‘‘National 
Attention Deficit Disorder Awareness 
Day’’; 
(2) recognizes Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity 
Disorder (ADHD) as a major public 
health concern; 
(3) encourages all Americans to find out 
more about ADHD, support ADHD mental 
health services, and seek the appropriate 
treatment and support, if necessary; 
(4) expresses the sense of the Senate that 
the Federal Government has a responsibility 
to— 
(A) endeavor to raise awareness about 
ADHD; and 
(B) continue to consider ways to improve 
access and quality of mental health services 
dedicated to improving the quality of life of 
children and adults with ADHD; and 
(5) calls on Federal, State, and local administrators 
and the people of the United 
States to observe the day with appropriate 
programs and activities.

DAY 

Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. BAUCUS, 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE, and Mr. TESTER) submitted 
the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 

S. RES. 650 
Whereas gestures of welcoming and kindness 
between neighbors foster community 
peace, harmony, and understanding; 
Whereas being good neighbors to those 
around us encourages mutual respect and 
friendship; 
Whereas neighborhoods facilitate positive 
civic engagement and enhance the foundation 
of an effective and more caring society; 
Whereas National Neighbor Day, celebrated 
annually on the Sunday before Memorial 
Day weekend in May, was first celebrated 
in 1993 in Westerly, Rhode Island, to 
promote equality, dignity, and respect and 
to encourage love of one’s neighbor; 
Whereas National Good Neighbor Day, 
celebrated annually on the fourth Sunday of 
September, was first celebrated in the 1970s 
in Lakeside, Montana, to place a greater emphasis 
on the importance of community and 
being a good neighbor; and 
Whereas National Neighborhood Day, celebrated 
annually on the third Sunday of September, 
was first celebrated in Providence, 
Rhode Island, to inspire, build, and sustain 
neighborhood relationships and foster civic 
engagement: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate calls upon the 
people of the United States and interested 
groups and organizations— 

(1) to celebrate the goals of National 
Neighbor Day, National Good Neighbor Day, 
and National Neighborhood Day in 2008; and 
(2) to undertake appropriate ceremonies, 
events, and activities associated with those 
goals.

moon and returning him safely to Earth was 
realized with the Apollo 11 mission, commanded 
by Neil A. Armstrong, Lunar Module 
Pilot Edwin ‘‘Buzz’’ Aldrin, Jr., and Command 
Module pilot Michael Collins; 
Whereas on April 12, 1981, NASA began a 
new era of human space flight and exploration 
with the launch of the first Space 
Shuttle Columbia, commanded by John W. 
Young and piloted by Robert L. ‘‘Bob’’ 
Crippen; 
Whereas on June 18, 1983, Dr. Sally Ride became 
the first American woman in space as 
a crewmember of Space Shuttle Challenger 
for STS–7; 
Whereas NASA has greatly expanded our 
knowledge and understanding of our planet 
and solar system through various unmanned 
vehicles utilized on numerous missions; 
Whereas, during the Cold War, NASA’s 
achievements served as a source of national 
pride and captured the imagination of the 
world by demonstrating a peaceful use of our 
technological capabilities; 
Whereas NASA now serves as a model for 
international cooperation and American 
leadership through the International Space 
Station and other scientific endeavors; 
Whereas thanks to NASA and the far-
reaching gaze of the Hubble Space Telescope, 
we have seen further into our universe than 
ever before; 
Whereas NASA space probes have landed 
on or flown by eight of the planets in our 
solar system; 
Whereas the aeronautics research by NASA 
has led to great discoveries and advances in 
aircraft design and aviation; 
Whereas the work done by NASA has expanded 
the scope of human knowledge, created 
new technologies, and inspired young 
men and women to enter scientific and engineering 
careers; 
Whereas in the last fifty years, NASA has 
positively impacted almost every facet of 
our lives; and 
Whereas, thanks to the heroism, courage, 
and supreme sacrifice of our astronaut corps 
over the last five decades, we are now able to 
live and work in space for the benefit of all 
humankind: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, by the Senate That the Senate—— 

(1) honors the men and women of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration 
on the occasion of its 50th Anniversary; 
(2) acknowledges the value of NASA’s discoveries

SEC. 604. SOLID WASTE RAIL TRANSFER FACILITY 
LAND-USE EXEMPTION AUTHORITY. 

(a) IN GENERAL.—Chapter 109 is further 
amended by adding at the end thereof the 
following: 
‘‘§ 10909. Solid waste rail transfer facility 
land-use exemption 

‘‘(a) AUTHORITY.—The Board may issue a 
land-use exemption for a solid waste rail 
transfer facility that is or is proposed to be 
operated by or on behalf of a rail carrier if— 

‘‘(1) the Board finds that a State, local, or 
municipal law, regulation, order, or other requirement 
affecting the siting of such facility 
unreasonably burdens the interstate 
transportation of solid waste by railroad, 
discriminates against the railroad transportation 
of solid waste and a solid waste rail 
transfer facility, or a rail carrier that owns 
or operates such a facility petitions the 
Board for such an exemption; or 

‘‘(2) the Governor of a State in which a facility 
that is operating as of the date of en


actment of the Clean Railroads Act of 2008 is 
located, or his or her designee, petitions the 
Board to initiate a permit proceeding for 
that particular facility. 

‘‘(b) LAND-USE EXEMPTION PROCEDURES.— 
No later than 90 days after the date of enactment 
of the Clean Railroad Act of 2008, the 
Board shall publish procedures governing the 
submission and review of applications for 
solid waste rail transfer facility land-use exemptions. 
At a minimum, the procedures 
shall address— 

‘‘(1) the information that each application 
should contain to explain how the solid 
waste rail transfer facility will not pose an 
unreasonable risk to public health, safety or 
the environment; 

‘‘(2) the opportunity for public notice and 
comment including notification of the municipality, 
the State, and any relevant Federal 
or State regional planning entity in the 
jurisdiction of which the solid waste rail 
transfer facility is proposed to be located; 

‘‘(3) the timeline for Board review, including 
a requirement that the Board approve or 
deny an exemption within 90 days after the 
full record for the application is developed; 

‘‘(4) the expedited review timelines for petitions 
for modifications, amendments, or 
revocations of granted exemptions; 

‘‘(5) the process for a State to petition the 
Board to require a solid waste transfer facility 
or a rail carrier that owns or operates 
such a facility to apply for a siting permit; 
and 

‘‘(6) the process for a solid waste transfer 
facility or a rail carrier that owns or operates 
such a facility to petition the Board for 
a land-use exemption. 

‘‘(c) STANDARD FOR REVIEW.— 

‘‘(1) The Board may only issue a land use 
exemption if it determines that the facility 
at the existing or proposed location does not 
pose an unreasonable risk to public health, 
safety, or the environment. In deciding 
whether a solid waste rail transfer facility 
that is or proposed to be constructed or operated 
by or on behalf of a rail carrier poses an 
unreasonable risk to public health, safety, or 
the environment, the Board shall weigh the 
particular facility’s potential benefits to and 
the adverse impacts on public health, public 
safety, the environment, interstate commerce, 
and transportation of solid waste by 
rail. 

‘‘(2) The Board may not grant a land-use 
exemption for a solid waste rail transfer facility 
proposed to be located on land within 
any unit of or land affiliated with the National 
Park System, the National Wildlife 
Refuge System, the National Wilderness 
Preservation System, the National Trails 
System, the National Wild and Scenic Rivers 
System, a National Reserve, a National 
Monument, or lands referenced in Public 
Law 108–421 for which a State has implemented 
a conservation management plan, if 
operation of the facility would be inconsistent 
with restrictions placed on such land. 

‘‘(d) CONSIDERATIONS.—When evaluating an 
application under this section, the Board 
shall consider and give due weight to the following, 
as applicable: 

‘‘(1) the land use, zoning, and siting regulations 
or solid waste planning requirements of 
the State or State subdivision in which the 
facility is or will be located that are applicable 
to solid waste transfer facilities, including 
those that are not owned or operated by 
or on behalf of a rail carrier; 

‘‘(2) the land use, zoning, and siting regulations 
or solid waste planning requirements 
applicable to the property where the solid 
waste rail transfer facility is proposed to be 
located; 

‘‘(3) regional transportation planning requirements 
developed pursuant to Federal 
and State law; 

‘‘(4) regional solid waste disposal plans developed 
pursuant to State or Federal law; 

‘‘(5) any Federal and State environmental 
protection laws or regulations applicable to 
the site; 

‘‘(6) any unreasonable burdens imposed on 
the interstate transportation of solid waste 
by railroad, or the potential for discrimination 
against the railroad transportation of 
solid waste, a solid waste rail transfer facility, 
or a rail carrier that owns or operates 
such a facility; and 

‘‘(7) any other relevant factors, as determined 
by the Board. 

(e) EXISTING FACILITIES.—Upon the granting 
of petition from the State in which a 
solid waste rail transfer facility is operating 
as of the date of enactment of the Clean 
Railroads Act of 2008 by the Board, the facility 
shall submit a complete application for a 
siting permit to the Board pursuant to the 
procedures issued pursuant to subsection (b). 
No State may enforce a law, regulation, 
order, or other requirement affecting the 
siting of a facility that is operating as of the 
date of enactment of the Clean Railroads Act 
of 2008 until the Board has approved or denied 
a permit pursuant to subsection (c). 
‘‘(f) EFFECT OF LAND-USE EXEMPTION.—If 
the Board grants a land-use exemption to a 
solid waste rail transfer facility, all State 
laws, regulations, orders, or other requirements 
affecting the siting of a facility are 
preempted with regard to that facility. An 
exemption may require compliance with 
such State laws, regulations, orders, or other 
requirements. 

‘‘(g) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.—Nothing in this 
section precludes a person from seeking an 
injunction to enjoin a solid waste rail transfer 
facility from being constructed or operated 
by or on behalf of a rail carrier if that 
facility has materially violated, or will materially 
violate, its land use exemption or if 
it failed to receive a valid land-use exemption 
under this section. 

‘‘(h) FEES.—The Board may charge permit 
applicants reasonable fees to implement this 
section, including the costs of third-party 
consultants. 

‘‘(i) DEFINITIONS.—In this section the terms 
‘solid waste’, ‘solid waste rail transfer facility’, 
and ‘State requirements’ have the 
meaning given such terms in section 
10908(e).’’. 

(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—The chapter 
analysis for chapter 109, as amended by section 
603 of this Act, is amended by inserting 
after the item relating to section 10908 the 
following:

to affect the traditional police powers 
of the State to require a rail carrier to comply 
with State and local environmental, public 
health, and public safety standards that 
are not unreasonably burdensome to interstate 
commerce and do not discriminate 
against rail carriers.’’. 

(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—The chapter 
analysis for chapter 109, as amended by section 
604 of this Act, is amended by inserting 
after the item relating to section 10909 the 
following:

by a person to such State or States, any 
overpayment by such person shall be applied 
against such debts in the order in which such 
debts accrued. 

‘‘(3) OFFSET PERMITTED ONLY AGAINST RESIDENTS 
OF STATE SEEKING OFFSET.—Paragraph 

(1) shall apply to an overpayment by any 
person for a taxable year only if the address 
shown on the Federal return for such taxable

is valid and that the State has made reason


able efforts to obtain payment of such covered 
unemployment compensation debt. 

‘‘(5) COVERED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION 
DEBT.—For purposes of this subsection, 
the term ‘covered unemployment compensation 
debt’ means—

State certified by the Secretary of Labor 
pursuant to section 3304 and which remains 
uncollected for not more than 10 years;

of covered unemployment compensation 
debt to the Secretary via the Secretary 
of Labor in accordance with procedures established

procedures may require States to pay a fee 
to the Secretary of Labor to reimburse the 
Secretary of Labor for the costs of applying 
this subsection. Any such fee shall be established 
in consultation with the Secretary of 
the Treasury. Any fee paid to the Secretary 
of Labor may be deducted from amounts collected 
and shall be used to reimburse the appropriation 
account which bore all or part of 
the cost of applying this subsection.

such State under paragraph (1) shall pay 
promptly to the Secretary, in accordance

or employee in a year would be less 
than the required minimum percentage for 
such officer or employee in such year, the 
Comptroller General shall provide for a further 
increase in the rate of basic pay of such 
officer or employee. 

‘‘(B) The further increase under this subsection— 


‘‘(i) shall be equal to the amount necessary

increase (within the meaning of paragraph

(1)(A) the total amount of basic pay that 
would have been paid to the individual, for 
service performed during the period beginning 
on the effective date of the pay increase 
for 2006 and ending on the day before the effective 
date of the pay adjustment under 
subsection (c) (or, if earlier, the date on 
which the individual retires or otherwise 
ceases to be employed by the Government 
Accountability Office), if such individual had 
received both a 2.6 percent pay increase for 
2006 and a 2.4 percent pay increase for 2007, 
minus

in fact paid to the individual for service performed 
during the period described in subparagraph

calculated under paragraph (1). 
Eligibility for a lump-sum payment under 
this subsection shall be determined solely on 
the basis of whether an individual satisfies 
the requirements of subsection (a) (to be considered 
an individual to whom this section 
applies), and without regard to such individual’s 
employment status as of any date following 
the date of the enactment of this Act 
or any other factor.

or (d) shall be considered to permit or require— 
(1) the payment of any rate (or portion of 
the lump-sum amount as calculated under 
subsection (d)(1) based on a rate) for any pay 
period, to the extent that such rate would be 
(or would have been) inconsistent with the 
limitation that applies (or that applied) with 
respect to such pay period under section 
732(c)(2) of title 31, United States Code; or

such title 31 for purposes of the adjustment 
under such paragraph for that year; or 
(B) the individual involved was not an officer 
or employee of the Government Accountability 
Office on the date as of which that increase 
took effect. 
As used in paragraph (2)(A), the term ‘‘satisfactory’’ 
includes a rating of ‘‘meets expectations’’ 
(within the meaning of the performance 
appraisal system used for purposes of 
the adjustment under section 732(c)(3) of 
such title 31 for the year involved). 
(f) RETIREMENT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The portion of the lump-
sum payment paid under subsection (d) to an 
officer or employee as calculated under subsection

section 8331 or 8401 of title 5, United States 
Code) which is used to compute an annuity 
under subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 
84 of such title— 
(A) be treated as basic pay (as defined by 
section 8331 or 8401 of such title); and 
(B) be allocated to the biweekly pay periods 
covered by subsection (d). 
(2) CONTRIBUTIONS TO CIVIL SERVICE RETIREMENT 
AND DISABILITY RETIREMENT FUND.— 
(A) EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS.—The Government 
Accountability Office shall deduct 
and withhold from the lump-sum payment 
paid to each employee under subsection (d) 
an amount equal to the difference between— 
(i) employee contributions that would have 
been deducted and withheld from pay under 
section 8334 or 8422 of title 5, United States 
Code, if the portion of the lump-sum payment 
as calculated under subsection (d)(1) 
had been additionally paid as basic pay during 
the period described under subsection 
(d)(1) of this section; and 
(ii) employee contributions that were actually 
deducted and withheld from pay under 
section 8334 or 8422 of title 5, United States 
Code, during that period. 
(B) AGENCY CONTRIBUTIONS AND PAYMENT TO 
THE FUND.—Not later than 9 months after the 
Government Accountability Office makes

or employee in a year would be less 
than the required minimum percentage for

Comptroller General shall provide for a fur


ther increase in the rate of basic pay of such

and 
(2) an officer or employee who received 
both a 2.6 percent pay increase in January

2007. 
(b) PAY INCREASE DEFINED.—For purposes 
of this section, the term ‘‘pay increase’’, as 
used with respect to an officer or employee 
in connection with a year, means the total 
increase in the rate of basic pay (expressed 
as a percentage) of such officer or employee, 
taking effect under sections 731(b) and 
732(c)(3) of title 31, United States Code, in

month period beginning on the date of the 
enactment of this Act (or such earlier date

rate of basic pay for each individual to whom 
this section applies shall be determined as if 
such individual had received both a 2.6 percent 
pay increase for 2006 and a 2.4 percent 
pay increase for 2007, subject to subsection

(d) LUMP-SUM PAYMENT.—Not later than 6

subsection (c) (or, if earlier, the date on 
which the individual retires or otherwise 
ceases to be employed by the Government 
Accountability Office), if such individual had

minus 

(2) the total amount of basic pay that was 
in fact paid to the individual for service performed 
during the period described in paragraph

Eligibility for a lump-sum payment under 
this subsection shall be determined solely on

applies), and without regard to such individual’s 
employment status as of any date following 
the date of the enactment of this Act

would have been) inconsistent with the limitation 
that applies (or that applied) with respect

732(c)(2) of title 31, United States Code; or 
(2) the payment of any rate or amount 
based on the pay increase for 2006 or 2007 (as

involved was not at a satisfactory 
level, as determined by the Comptroller General 
under paragraph (3) of section 732(c) of 
such title 31 for purposes of the adjustment 
under such paragraph for that year; or 
(B) the individual involved was not an officer 
or employee of the Government Accountability 
Office on the date as of which that increase 
took effect. 
As used in paragraph (2)(A), the term ‘‘satisfactory’’ 
includes a rating of ‘‘meets expectations’’ 
(within the meaning of the performance 
appraisal system used for purposes of 
the adjustment under section 732(c)(3) of 
such title 31 for the year involved).

if such lump-sum payment had been additionally 
paid as basic pay during the period described 
under subsection (d)(1) of this section;

August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1641 

EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS 

A TRIBUTE TO JOVENES, INC. AND 

ITS NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED 

STREET SOCCER TEAM 

HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize four highly motivated 
and talented street soccer players and their 
coach who traveled from Los Angeles to our 
nation’s capital this summer to compete in the 
Homeless USA Cup. This was the first time a 
team from Los Angeles joined the street soccer 
tournament, which this year included 
homeless and formerly homeless youth from 
11 cities throughout the country. 

I am especially proud of the fact that this 
talented and resilient team was sponsored by 
Jovenes, Inc., an exemplary community organization 
that provides needed services to 
homeless and low-income Latinos in my 34th 
Congressional District. 

Jovenes, Inc. was founded in 1989 by Reverend 
Richard Estrada, Associate Pastor of 
Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Church in 
Downtown, Los Angeles. Initially, Father 
Estrada created Jovenes, Inc.—which means 
youth in Spanish—to address the dire needs 
of homeless immigrant youth in Los Angeles. 

Today, while Jovenes, Inc. remains committed 
to assisting the immigrant Latino community, 
the non-profit organization has expanded 
its reach. Jovenes, Inc. assists at-risk 
young people ages 16 to 24, foster youth, 
homeless individuals of all ages, and low-income 
families. Each year, an estimated 1,500 
youth benefit from Jovenes, Inc.’s services, 
which include emergency and transitional 
housing, arts programs, mental health services, 
health education, employment preparation, 
financial literacy classes for families, 
after-school programs, GED preparation and 
computer courses. 

Madam Speaker, I have had the pleasure of 
working with Father Estrada and Jovenes, Inc. 
on several occasions. He is an uplifting and 
positive force throughout the community and I 
thank him for his advocacy and tireless work 
to improve the lives of young people and families 
in my district and elsewhere in Los Angeles 
County. 

Clearly, the notable success of our four 
street soccer players—Johny, Densi, Carlos 
and Peter—who competed in the Homeless 
USA Cup in June have the dedicated staff of 
Jovenes, Inc., especially Executive Director 
Ernesto Montan˜o, and Director of Programs/ 
Team Coach Andrea Marchetti, to thank for 
working to make such memorable and empowering 
opportunities available to them. 

While our star street soccer players from 
Los Angeles lost in their final round against a 
Minnesota team at the U.S. Homeless Cup, 
their unstoppable performance in the qualifying 
round got them noticed. They were all 
selected for spots on the national team. Three 
of the players will travel to Australia in Decem


ber to represent the United States in the 
Homeless World Cup. The fourth player will 
serve as an alternate. In addition, all four athletes 
have been invited to come back to next 
year’s Homeless USA Cup to motivate and 
serve as examples for new teams and players. 
In between competitions, the Jovenes, Inc. 
players continue to work to turn their lives 
around by resuming their education, furthering 
their careers, and chasing their goals to live 
independently in a stable and safe environment. 


The organization’s newsletter poignantly 
sums up the impact of the street-soccer tournaments 
in helping to inspire and motivate 
these soccer players. ‘‘For our youth this is 
the country that is giving them an opportunity 
for a successful life, and they will do their best 
to make everybody proud of them, on and off 
the pitch! . . . Through soccer, homeless individuals 
have a way to find the motivation, energy 
and discipline to solve their daily struggles 
and feel appreciated and respected. 
Jovenes, Inc. will continue this experience in 
the future to motivate our youth to succeed 
through sports in their life.’’ 

Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
please join me in recognizing the significant 
work of Father Estrada and Jovenes, Inc. in 
bettering the lives of young people and Latino 
families in the community. I also congratulate 
Johny, Densi, Carlos and Peter for their exceptional 
street-soccer abilities. They are truly 
an inspiration, on and off the soccer field. 
After all, as they have shown, with the right 
support and a lot of hard work, anything is 
possible.

TRIBUTE TO THE KOSSUTH 
COUNTY FAIR 

HON. TOM LATHAM 

OF IOWA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Kossuth County Fair on its 
150th year anniversary, from July 24 to August 
3, 2008. The Kossuth County Fair is located 
in Algona, Iowa and serves the approximate 
17,000 residents of the county in North 
Central Iowa. 

Throughout many years the Kossuth County 
Fair has thrived and kept the county together 
with community fellowship, celebration and camaraderie. 
I congratulate the Kossuth County 
Fair on this historic anniversary. It is an honor 
to represent the past and current members of 
the county fair board in the United States Congress. 
I wish the Kossuth County Fair an 
equally storied future.

Duncan McCoy for his service to the Boulder 
City community and congratulate him on his 
retirement. 

Duncan has dedicated his life to enriching 
the lives of others and sharing his passion for 
reading. Duncan is a veteran librarian with 
over 38 years of experience and he became 
Director of the Boulder City library in 1989. 
Upon becoming Director, Mr. McCoy has continuously 
and tirelessly advocated for the Boulder

paid off when he was able to secure bond 
funding to help the library move into a much 
larger building to expand its growth. 

Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor my 
friend Duncan McCoy. His vision and commitment 
to excellence have greatly enriched the 
Boulder City community and allowed many of 
our friends and neighbors to experience the 
joys of reading. I applaud his efforts and wish 
him the best in his future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING THE HOPE AND 
LIGHT FOUNDATION 

HON. TOM PRICE 

OF GEORGIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Hope and Light 
Foundation for their enduring commitment to 
the elimination of Spinal Muscular Atrophy. 

Founded by Aaron and Stephanie Miller 
after their first child was diagnosed with SMA, 
this group has tirelessly advocated research 
and education to eliminate this threat. They 
have armed families with the latest data and 
educated public, business, and community 
leaders about the need for more focus on this 
genetic disorder. 

Thanks in part to their work, such as co-
funding the first FDA approved drug trial for 
SMA Type I and organizing the first Southeastern 
conference dedicated to SMA care 
and research, the families and researchers 
working to find a cure are closer than ever. 
Out of over 600 neurological disorders analyzed 
by the National Institutes of Health, SMA 
is considered the closest to realizing effective 
treatment. 

Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me and recognize the Hope and Light Foundation 
for their positive efforts for thousands of

Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize an outstanding citizen and 
public servant, J.R. Ronny Brownlow, in honor 
of his retirement from law enforcement after 
serving the public for 44 years. 

In 1964, Sheriff Brownlow began his life of

MS. SALLY GALEGO HONORED FOR 
HER LONGEVITY 

HON. C. W. BILL YOUNG 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Ms. Sally Galego of Largo, 
Florida who I am proud to represent, for being 
one of Florida’s longest living persons at 108 
years old. 

During Ms. Galego’s rich life she has witnessed 
the popularization of indoor plumbing, 
electricity, flight, the internet and so many 
wonderful innovations that made the last century 
so great. Born in 1900, she lived through 
the American Century, a time of great turmoil 
and triumph, through which our nation has become 
one of the truly great nations of the 
world. 

For the benefit of my colleagues, I would 
like to include in the RECORD a story about 
Ms. Galego from her hometown paper, the 
Largo Leader. 

Madam Speaker, Ms. Galego is a reminder 
of this last century as we look forward to the 
new one stretched out ahead of us. Please 
join me in congratulating her for her long lifetime 
of experiences. 

[FROM THE LARGO LEADER, JUN. 12, 2008] 
(By Thomas Michalski) 
LARGO—Sally Galego will be 108 years old 
on Saturday, June 14. She might be among 
the oldest person in Pinellas County, man or 
woman, and possibly the state, but still goes 
to the YMCA three times a week to exercise. 
She was born before the Wright Brothers 
flew their first plane and before the popularity 
of electricity, automobiles, radio and 
television came along. 
‘‘I have many, many fond memories,’’ 
Galego said. Born June 14, 1900 in Belfast, 
Maine, she and her two brothers and two sisters 
grew up on a 100-acre farm. There was no 
electricity. No telephones. No inside plumbing. 
One sister, Louise, 99, of Bangor, Maine, 
survives and the two sisters stay in touch on 
a regular basis. 
Galego’s father was killed by a swarm of 
bees when she was 9. She later not only graduated 
elementary school, but high school 
and college as well. That was almost unheard 
of in those days. Galego recalls seeing television 
for the first time at the 1939–40 New 
York World’s Fair. 
Over the years, she traveled the world to 
visit the pyramids in Egypt, the Vatican in 
Rome and toured England, Ireland, Scotland, 
Wales and other countries.

TRIBUTE TO NICK DONOFRIO 

HON. PETER WELCH 

OF VERMONT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Madam Speaker, it 
is my great pleasure to pay special tribute to 
Mr. Nick Donofrio who is retiring after more 
than 40 years in various leadership capacities 
at the IBM Corporation. 

Nick Donofrio is an adopted son of the 
Green Mountain State. For many years, Nick 
led IBM’s semiconductor development and 
manufacturing facility in Burlington and he and 
his wife, Anita, raised their two children, Nicole 
and Michael, in Vermont. 

Nick joined IBM in 1967 and spent the early 
part of his career in integrated circuit and chip 
development, as a designer of logic and memory 
chips. He held numerous technical management 
positions and, later, executive positions 
in several of IBM’s product divisions. He 
has led many of IBM’s major development and 
manufacturing teams—from semiconductor 
and storage technologies, to microprocessors 
and personal computers, to IBM’s entire family 
of servers. 

Nick has always been a champion for innovation 
across IBM and its global ecosystem. 
He has been the leader of IBM’s global technology 
strategy. In addition to his strategic 
business mission, Nick has led the development 
and retention of IBM’s technical population 
and strives to enrich that community 
with a diversity of culture and thought. 

Nick has been focused sharply on advancing 
education, employment and career opportunities 
for under represented minorities and 
women—all issues of great importance to me 
as well. 

He served for many years on the Board of 
Directors for the National Action Council for 
Minorities in Engineering (NACME). He has 
served on the Board of Directors for INROADS, 
a non-profit organization focused on 
the training and development of talented minority 
youth for professional careers in business 
and industry, and he is co-chair of the 
New York Hall of Science. A fellow Italian-
American, Nick was awarded the prestigious 
2007 National Education and Leadership 
Award from the Sons of Italy Foundation. 

He is the holder of seven technology patents 
and is a member of numerous technical 
and science honor societies. In 2002, Nick 
was recognized by Europe’s Institution of 
Electrical Engineers with the Mensforth International 
Gold Medal for outstanding contributions 
to the advancement of manufacturing engineering. 
In 2003, he was named Industry 
Week magazine’s Technology Leader of the 
Year, the University of Arizona’s Technical Executive 
of the Year, and was presented with 
the Rodney D. Chipp Memorial Award by the 
Society of Women Engineers for his outstanding 
contributions to the advancement of 
women in the engineering field. In 2005, Nick 
was elected a member of the American Academy 
of Arts and Sciences, he was presented 
with Syracuse University’s highest alumni 
honor—the George Arents Pioneer Medal, and 
he was honored by CNBC with its Overall 
Technology Leadership Award. 

Madam Speaker, please join me in congratulating 
Nick Donofrio, as he begins a new 
exciting chapter in his life.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO DEMA GUINN 

HON. JON C. PORTER 

OF NEVADA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. PORTER. Madam Speaker, it is my distinct 
pleasure to rise today to honor the former 
First Lady of Nevada, Dema Guinn, by entering 
her name in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1643 

the official record of the proceedings and debates 
of the United States Congress since 
1873. Today, I pay tribute to Dema Guinn for 
her outstanding service to the State of Nevada. 


Mrs. Guinn has served the Nevada community 
in countless ways including her fundraising 
campaigns for both the Nevada State 
Museum and the Keck Mining Museum. Her 
efforts in bringing Nevada’s second statue, 
Sarah Winnemucca, to Statuary Hall of the 
Capitol in Washington, D.C. and her renovation 
of the Governor’s Mansion to better reflect 
Nevada’s history were both great successes. 
While First Lady Dema Guinn has been involved 
in many projects, her largest contribution 
has been her continued support of Nevada’s 
health care system. Having lost a cousin 
to breast cancer in 1995, Mrs. Guinn recognized 
the hardships and suffering felt by many 
Nevadans in similar situations. The real tragedy 
is that Mrs. Guinn’s cousin did not have 
health insurance and never had the chance to 
have a mammogram performed, which could 
have staved off this vicious disease. From this 
devastation, First Lady Dema Guinn was able 
to found the Mammovan, a traveling health 
care van that provides free mammograms to 
uninsured women. 

The Mammovan began touring Nevada in 
January of 2000. During Mrs. Guinn’s tenure 
as First Lady, the Mammovan assisted more 
than 17,000 women. In 2007, after many successful 
trips throughout the state visiting rural 
areas of Nevada, it became necessary to acquire 
a new van to continue this vital service 
to our State. 

A community partnership was formed with 
Harrah’s Foundation and the Nevada Health 
Center to help finance a new Mammovan. 
This improved van will have the ability to help 
even more women. Mrs. Guinn’s many accomplishments 
during her term have extended far 
beyond her duties as First Lady. Today, her 
tireless generosity continues as she works to 
assist many citizens in our great State. Dema 
Guinn’s endeavors leave behind the legacy of 
a compassionate woman and a dedicated Nevadan. 


Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Dema 
Guinn. Her dedication to our community, and 
specifically the health care system, has impacted 
countless Nevadans. I applaud her 
successes and thank her for her dedication to 
Nevada.

TRIBUTE TO DANIEL HOLSTE 

HON. TOM LATHAM 

OF IOWA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize 
the retirement of Mr. Daniel Holste, a 
science teacher at Humboldt High School in 
Humboldt, Iowa, and to express my appreciation 
for his dedication and commitment to the 
youth of Iowa. 

For the last 39 years, Mr. Holste has contributed 
his time to educating and enriching 
the lives of youths. After graduating from 
Wartburg College, Mr. Holste began teaching 
in Alta, Iowa, for 2 years and took a year off 
for graduate studies at Fisk University. He returned 
to teaching for 3 years in Eddyville, 
Iowa, until he took a teaching position at Hum


boldt High School, where he remained for 34 
years until his recent retirement. In the classroom, 
Mr. Holste has taught numerous 
courses including Chemistry, Advanced/Organic 
Chemistry, Physics, Geology/Astronomy, 
Hydrology and several math courses. Mr. 
Holste has also sponsored the Junior Engineering 
Technical Society Tests of Engineering 
Aptitude in Math and Science (JETS– 
TEAM), Science Bowl, Knowledge Master 
Open and the Physics Olympics. In 1990, his 
team earned the Iowa Physics Olympics Team 
Grand Championship, and his JETS–TEAM 
has placed as high as second nationally. 

Mr. Holste has also received a number of 
awards in recent years. In 2006, he was honored 
with the Outstanding Youth Leadership 
Award. In 2007 he received the Fort Dodge 
District Air Force Association Teacher of the 
Year Award. This year he also earned the 
ISEA UniServ Unit 10 ‘‘Distinguished Service 
to the Association’’ Award. 

Mr. Holste’s leadership will be missed, but 
he leaves a lasting impact on the Humboldt 
community and everyone he has been involved 
with. I consider it an honor to represent 
Mr. Daniel Holste in the United States Congress, 
and I wish him and his wife, Jean, a 
long, happy and healthy retirement as they 
both continue to serve the community through 
different projects.

COLONEL LEONARD SCHROEDER 

HONORED AS FIRST AMERICAN 

INVADER ON D-DAY 

HON. C. W. BILL YOUNG 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. YOUNG of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to commend Retired Colonel Leonard 
Schroeder of Largo, Florida who I am 
proud to represent, for being the first American 
soldier to land at Utah Beach. 

During the Invasion of Normandy, Colonel 
Schroeder led F Company onto Utah Beach 
as part of the first wave of American infantry 
at the battle that would turn the war. Commander 
Schroeder bravely battled for eight 
hours before being shot and forced to leave 
the fight. 

As part of the first landing, F Company took 
heavy casualties with half of the members 
killed or injured before Colonel Schroeder was 
hit himself. 

Colonel Schroeder continued to serve our 
great nation through World War II earning both 
a Silver and Bronze Star. He went on to fight 
in the Korean War and provide logistical support 
during the Vietnam conflict. Colonel 
Schroeder retired from the Army in 1971. 

Madam Speaker, Colonel Schroeder represents 
the best our Nation has to offer. He 
served our Nation in uniform and to protect 
our freedom and liberty in its darkest days. 
Please join me in saying thank you to him for 
his actions and his lifetime of service. 

[FROM THE ST. PETERSBURG TIMES, JUNE 6, 

2008] 

(By Demorris A. Lee) 

Leonard Schroeder will never forget watching 
the sun rise off the coast of France the 
morning of June 6, 1944. 

Schroeder, who was 25 and an Army company 
commander, spent the night before the 

D-day invasion with the 219 soldiers from 
Company F in small, flat-bottomed boats. 

‘‘We were a little nervous, hoping we were 
going to hit the place we were supposed to 
hit,’’ said Schroeder, who is now 89 and lives 
in Largo. 

At about 6:30 a.m., Schroeder’s company 
began wading toward shore in waist-high 
water. He held up his .45-caliber pistol to 
keep it from getting wet. 

Amid a flurry of smoke and gunfire, they 
stormed Utah Beach. Schroeder is believed 
to be the first American solider to step foot 
on the beach during the battle considered 
the turning point of World War II. 

‘‘We prayed and prayed that everyone got 
the right signal,’’ said Schroeder, who retired 
from the Army in 1971 as a colonel. 

It’s been 64 years since that fateful day. 
But Schroeder said the images from that 
morning remain etched in his mind forever. 

For the next eight hours, Schroeder led his 
men in battle. By noon, half of them were either 
killed or injured. 

Relatives thousands of miles away in 
America were desperate for details. 

Schroeder’s wife, Margaret, 91, said she received 
a call from her mother-in-law that 
morning. 

‘‘She said, ‘My son and your husband landed 
safely on the beach,’’’ Margaret said, 
laughing. ‘‘I thank God over and over that he 
made it back safely to his family.’’ 

During the fight, a machine gun round 
ripped open Schroeder’s left forearm. The 
next thing he remembers, he was heading to 
a hospital in England. 

‘‘I lost some time after that, and don’t remember 
what happened or how long,’’ 
Schroeder said. ‘‘The decision was whether 
they could save my arm.’’ Schroeder’s forearm 
still bears the long scar from his five 
surgeries. 

From Glen Burnie, Md., Schroeder graduated 
from the University of Maryland. 
After World War II, he went on to fight in 
the Korean War and worked logistics during 
Vietnam. He believes he is the only remaining 
survivor among his college classmates 
who participated in World II. Two of those 
classmates died last year. 

Schroeder, who earned a Silver Star and a 
Bronze Star during World War II, now surrounds 
himself with memories of his Army 
service. Two ball caps with his unit’s name 
are proudly displayed in his living room. In 
his office are framed military ribbons and 
certificates. 

The black leather boots Schroeder wore 
when he landed on Utah Beach are in the garage. 
There is also a huge poster of him on 
the front of a French magazine that proclaimed 
him the first man to land on a beach 
in Normandy during D-day. He and his wife 
of 66 years were flown to France in 1984 in 
honor of D-day’s 50th anniversary. 

Though he turns 90 on July 16, there’s another 
date that’s just as important. ‘‘I say 
that June 6 is my second birthday,’’ he said.

For the past 41 years, Mr. Reemstma has 
contributed his time and talents to educating 


E1644 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

and enriching the lives of youths. Mr. 
Reemstma graduated from Sioux Falls College 
in 1967 and took his first job at Melcher-Dallas. 
In 1970 he took a science teaching position 
at O.B. Laing Middle School in Algona, 
where he remained until his retirement. He actually 
hated science classes while growing up 
but began to enjoy science during his senior 
year high school biology class. During his time 
as a teacher, he especially enjoyed taking 
Washington, DC, trips with students. In addition 
to teaching, Mr. Reemstma is the music 
director at First Presbyterian Church in Algona 
and the president of the Water’s Edge Nature 
Center Foundation. In all, Mr. Reemstma has 
helped shape the lives of thousands of students. 


Mr. Reemstma’s leadership will be missed, 
but he leaves a lasting impact on the Algona 
community and everyone he has been involved 
with. I consider it an honor to represent 
Mr. Walter Reemstma in the United States 
Congress, and I wish him a long, happy and 
healthy retirement.

RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE 
OF CONNECTING FOSTER YOUTH 
TO THE WORKFORCE THROUGH 
INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS 

SPEECH OF 

HON. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, July 29, 2008 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 
1332, ‘‘Recognizing the importance of connecting 
foster youth to the workforce through 
internship programs, and encouraging employers 
to increase employment of former foster 
youth’’. First, I would like to thank my distinguished 
colleague, DENNIS CARDOZA of California, 
for introducing this important piece of 
legislation. This resolution will recognize the 
significance of creating links between foster 
youth and the workplace through internship 
opportunities while also urging employers to 
pursue former foster youth. The creation of internship 
and employment opportunities for current 
and former foster youths has the potential 
to dramatically shape the lives of thousands 
for the better. I strongly encourage my colleagues 
to support this act. 

There are over 500,000 children and youth 
in foster care. As the youth age out of the system, 
50 percent become homeless within the 
first 18 months of emancipation. Less than 
half of these youth are employed 2.5–4 years 
after leaving the system. Only 38 percent remain 
employed for over a year. Former foster 
care youth are twice as likely to have children 
in foster care. This problem is systemic, yet 
through opportunities and internships we can 
break this cycle of impoverishment and failure. 

This bill is an appeal to our Nation’s employers 
to help us address this issue by providing 
internships for disadvantaged foster 
youth, and by providing employment once they 
‘‘age-out’’ of the foster care system. Such action 
will instill knowledge and work-ethic. 
These experiences will open up a new world 
of opportunity to a group that was struggling, 
not due to a lack of inherent qualifications, but 
rather due to the misfortunes of their upbringing. 


This resolution will express the desire of 
Congress to address the problems of foster 
care youth, and this resolution will express 
Congress’ widespread support of partnerships 
and initiatives between businesses and foster 
care programs, to help better prepare foster 
care youth for the working world. 

This resolution seeks to benefit the over 
500,000 foster care children and youth by providing 
them with the opportunity to further 
themselves through educational and work experiences. 
As these experiences accrue, they 
will present the foster youth with an idea of 
the opportunities latent within their world, and 
will hopefully inspire them to move forward in 
pursuit of job and educational opportunities. 

As of 2003 there were 26,133 children in 
the Texas foster care system. Since then, the 
number has only risen. For many of these children 
the future will include stints in jail, poverty, 
and homelessness, yet strong action on 
the part of businesses and foster care programs 
in creating internships and partnerships 
may save many from this fate, leading them to 
secure jobs and successful lives. I have often 
concerned myself with issues regarding the 
safety and success of our future, our Nation’s 
children. By preventing toxic lead levels in 
houses, by ensuring the safety of children in 
schools, and by encouraging businesses to 
form partnerships with foster care, we take 
small, but significant, steps toward guaranteeing 
the well-being of our children and the 
security our Nation’s future. I urge my colleagues 
to support this legislation.

EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION 
AMENDMENT ACT OF 2O08 

SPEECH OF 

HON. DAVID DREIER 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of the extension of the e-verify program, which 
I have supported since it was initially created 
under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant 
Responsibility Act of 1996. Since that 
time we have continued our fight to strengthen 
our immigration laws. 

Unfortunately when we had the debate in 
1996 my colleagues did not approve an 
amendment to make our Social Security card 
counterfeit-proof. Since that time, I have 
worked with my colleagues in a bi-partisan 
way to ensure that we improve our employment 
verification system and Social Security 
cards so that neither is susceptible to fraud. 
To achieve this goal I have introduced H.R. 
98, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Social 
Security Protection Act with my colleague from 
Texas, the distinguished chair of the House Intelligence 
Committee and former Border Patrol 
Agent SILVESTRE REYES. This bill would go a 
long way to address the employment magnet 
that draws illegal immigrants to the United 
States. 

It is important to note that the bill before us 
commissions further studies on the e-verify 
program. We know from a 2005 GAO study on 
e-verify that the system is still susceptible to 
fraud and cannot identify when multiple people 
are using the same Social Security number. 
The raids conducted of Swift Meatpacking 
plants in 2006 showed the ease with which 

fraudulent Social Security numbers were used 
to gain unlawful employment. Swift was an e-
verify participant and yet was found to have 
been employing several hundred illegal immigrants. 


While I support this measure to extend the 
program, I hope very much that we can have 
a more open debate on the need to prevent 
fraud in our employment verification system. 
Only when we address the need to improve 
the security of the Social Security card and 
employment verification system will we be 
able crack down on the employment magnet 
that draws people to this country illegally.

CONGRATULATING ALBANIA AND 
CROATIA ON BEING INVITED TO 
BEGIN ACCESSION TALKS WITH 
THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY 
ORGANIZATION 

SPEECH OF 

HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
as we now consider and certainly will adopt 
House Resolution 1266, congratulating Albania 
and Croatia on being invited to begin accession 
talks with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
and expressing support for continuing 
to enlarge the alliance, I would like to 
express my support for these countries as 
they move forward. 

As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I 
convened a hearing on NATO enlargement in 
early March, where we examined the respective 
NATO prospects not only of Albania and 
Croatia but also of Macedonia, Georgia and 
Ukraine. While some of these countries must 
still contend with outstanding issues, whether 
of their own making or not, I strongly support 
their NATO aspirations and encourage them to 
move forward as well. 

I am well aware of the many hurdles Albania 
has faced in recovering from decades of 
extremely repressive communist rule. Albania 
has also had to confront an often 
undeservedly negative image in the rest of Europe. 
Receiving its invitation at the Bucharest 
summit in April, therefore, was an amazing 
achievement of which every Albanian citizen, 
regardless of their political affiliation, should 
be proud. It is my hope, however, that the 
sense of accomplishment will encourage the 
country’s leaders to continue the transition to 
a state based on democratic norms and the 
rule of law, especially as Albania prepares for 
elections next year and continues its investigation 
of the March tragedy at Gerdec. 

Croatia also has had to address many challenges 
prior to receiving its invitation, although 
in its case those challenges related to the very 
violent conflicts associated with Yugoslavia’s 
demise in the 1990s. It was clear that Croatia 
always had the potential to recover quickly, 
and it fortunately did just that. 

The challenges Albania and Croatia have 
faced, in my view, will ultimately make them 
better allies. Their citizens have an appreciation 
of freedom and a desire for protecting 
freedom that many living in more established 
democracies may have lost. And as countries

CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040 

CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY 

IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 

SPEECH OF 

HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 

OF CONNECTICUT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of the conference report on H.R. 
4040, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement 
Act of 2008, and applaud the members 
of the conference committee for their work in 
reaching an agreement on this very important 
legislation. 

I also would like to congratulate the coalition 
of consumer groups for their efforts, including: 
Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of 
America, Kids in Danger, National Research 
Center for Women & Families, Public Citizen, 
Union of Concerned Scientists, and the U.S. 
Public Interest Research Group. These groups 
were instrumental in urging the conference 
committee to adopt the best provisions from 
the House and Senate bills. 

After 2007 became the ‘‘Year of the Recall’’ 
due to the numerous recalls of toys and children’s 
products, it was imperative that Congress 
act to stem the flow of unsafe products 
into our stores and homes. That is why I introduced 
legislation that would, among other 
things, ban lead in children’s products, enhance 
recall and inspection authority of the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission, 
CPSC, and expedite recall disclosure to the 
public. This bill was cosponsored by 167 of 
my colleagues. 

I am pleased that some of the important 
ideas and provisions in this bill were included 
in the final conference report, including language 
that would: essentially ban lead in toys 
and children’s products; require CPSC to establish 
a publicly-accessible database to inform 
consumers about unsafe products; require 
third-party testing of certain children’s 
products; and ensure that the CPSC does not 
preempt State or local laws. 

I am especially pleased that that this legislation 
includes provisions to provide the CPSC 
with the new authority to cease the distribution 
of toys that pose an imminent hazard from the 
outset. This is a provision that I worked on 
with Congresswoman ESHOO, and I am proud 
to see it in the conference report. 

The conference committee should be commended 
for insisting that the final conference 
agreement include a ban on toxic phthalates 
from children’s products. Earlier this year, 
some of the country’s largest toy sellers, including 
Wal-Mart, Toys-R-Us, and Babies-R-
Us notified their suppliers that they would no 
longer carry products containing phthalates 
beginning in 2009. It would have been senseless 
if Congress had allowed for the continued 
use of phthalates in children’s products even 
though the market already has essentially 
banned it. 

Many of us who support the final conference 
report would agree that it could have been 
stronger, but we also agree that it represent a 
solid first step. We should remain vigilant in 

the future.

WATER USE EFFICIENCY AND 
CONSERVATION RESEARCH ACT 

SPEECH OF 

HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3957, a measure aimed at increasing research, 
development, education, and technology 
transfer activities related to water use 
efficiency and conservation technologies at the 
Environmental Protection Agency. 

It is evident that current water use and management 
practices are draining supplies and it 
is critical that we obtain knowledge of newer 
technologies that will increase sustainability. It 
is our hope that this legislation will promote 
technologies and approaches that will contribute 
towards ensuring a healthy and sustainable 
water supply. 

EPA’s research, development and dissemination 
of technologies that promote greater 
water use will also help to advance water conservation 
as a national goal. 

More importantly, however, it is our hope 
that it will reduce the threat of a diminishing 
water supply and prepare us for water shortages 
that are increasing in frequency. 

As the Chairwoman of the House Transportation 
and Infrastructure Subcommittee on 
Water Resources and Environment, I am 
keenly aware of the need for increased Federal 
research on new and emerging technologies 
for water use efficiency and conservation. 
As noted in testimony before my 
Subcommittee, the growing water-related challenges 
facing our nation, including the need to 
repair and replace much of our antiquated 
water infrastructure, urban sprawl, and the 
threat of global warming, requires us to address 
these challenges in an integrated, comprehensive 
fashion—including the need to develop 
the next generation of water-related infrastructure. 


I was pleased to work with Chairman GORDON 
and the sponsor of this legislation, Mr. 
Matheson, on an amendment to include within 
the scope of research and development program 
technologies and processes to enable 
the collection, storage, treatment and reuse of 
stormwater, as well as the creation of a publicly-
accessible clearing house for information 
on technologies and processes developed 
under this program. This amendment was 
adopted during the Committee on Science and 
Technology’s markup of this legislation. 

In an effort to bring this legislation to the 
floor for consideration as quickly as possible, 
the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
did not seek a referral of the bill. The 
Transportation Committee did this, however, 
with the understanding that this decision does 
not waive, reduce or affect the jurisdiction of 
the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. 


I look forward to a continuing dialogue with 
both the Senate and the Committee on 

and management practices that will contribute 
to the overall health of our nation. 

I also look forward to the next Congress 
when I hope to work with my colleagues on 
both the Science and Transportation Committees 
on improving research of water quality, 
as well as on improving the nation’s monitoring 
systems for all facets of our precious 
water resources. 

I urge my colleagues to join with me to support 
this bill, and authorizing the Environmental 
Protection Agency to establish a research 
and development program that will promote 
water use efficiency practices and promote 
water conservation as a national goal.

COMMODITY MARKETS TRANS


PARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY 

ACT OF 2008 

SPEECH OF 

HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 

OF MINNESOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of the Commodity 
Markets Transparency and Accountability Act 
of 2008 (H.R. 6604). I commend Chairman 
PETERSON for his hard work on this legislation, 
which will help curtail the rising oil prices 
through curbing excessive speculation in commodity 
futures markets. 

High gasoline prices are burdening American 
families every day. The conversation on 
addressing our energy challenge has focused 
largely around factors of supply and demand. 
However, the rise in the price of oil cannot be 
attributed to any one factor. Burgeoning world 
oil demand, collusive practices of OPEC nations, 
the weakening dollar, and possible excessive 
speculation in the energy futures market 
are all potential contributors to the problem. 


Though we cannot say with certainty whether 
speculation is driving up the price of oil, Department 
of Energy officials have observed 
that the magnitude of price increases is unlikely 
to result from supply and demand forces 
alone. They have pointed to excessive speculation 
as a likely contributor to inflated oil 
prices. In the face of this possibility, Congress 
should act now, without disrupting healthy 
market activity, to close loopholes and prevent 
excessive speculation from driving up prices 
and increasing hardship for American families. 

The Commodity Markets Transparency and 
Accountability Act enhances the regulatory capacity 
of the Commodity Futures Trade Commission 
(CFTC). Through increased staffing, 
closing corporate loopholes, and setting position 
limits for individuals, CFTC will be better 
equipped to address the problem of high energy 
prices that are burdening American families. 
The Commodity Markets Transparency 
and Accountability Act also directs the Government 
Accountability Office to conduct a detailed 
study of speculators’ effects on agriculture 
and energy futures markets and prices. 
Along with acting proactively to prevent potential 
excessive speculation today, this bill will 
allow for a better understanding of what the 
effects of speculation have actually been. 


E1646 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

The Commodity Markets Transparency and 
Accountability Act takes bold steps to curb excessive 
speculation that may be contributing 
to the hardships American families are facing

SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND 

IDEALS OF NATIONAL CAMPUS 

SAFETY AWARENESS MONTH 

SPEECH OF 

HON. LYNN C. WOOLSEY 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, July 29, 2008 

Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of H. Res. 1288, establishing September 
as National Campus Safety Awareness 
Month. Every college and university student 
should have the opportunity for a quality education 
on a campus where he or she feels 
safe and comfortable. We need to support efforts 
by our nation’s higher education institutions 
to improve safety on our campuses. 

National Campus Safety Awareness Month 
will encourage institutions to participate in endeavors 
to increase campus safety. September, 
one of the first months back to school, 
is a perfect time to remind college and university 
students about the importance of campus 
and personal safety. During the month of September 
and throughout the year, colleges and 
universities will be motivated to inform students 
about critical campus issues like sexual 
assault, drug and alcohol abuse, hazing, and 
stalking. Schools will be encouraged to use 
preventative programming to address potential 
problems early. By increasing knowledge and 
prevention of these issues, I know students 
can receive the valuable educational experience 
they deserve. I ask my colleagues to join 
me in supporting H. Res. 1288.

APOLOGIZING FOR THE ENSLAVE


MENT AND RACIAL SEGREGA


TION OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS 

SPEECH OF 

HON. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, July 29, 2008 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 
194, ‘‘Apologizing for the enslavement and racial 
segregation of African-Americans,’’ introduced 
by my distinguished colleague from 
Tennessee, Representative STEVE COHEN, of 
which I am a cosponsor. This important legislation 
expresses Congress’s remorse for 
America’s past treatment of African-Americans. 


Mr. Speaker, I know that many would think 
it a non-issue to address the events of over 
135 years ago, but the legacy of slavery and 
racial segregation continues to have a profound 
impact on American society. The social 
and economic disparity lives on, as do hatred, 
bias, and discrimination. The consequences of 
the slave trade have been profound and the 
scars that it produced still have not healed. 
Despite two centuries of progress, the African 
American community continues to feel the impact 
of slavery and subsequent years of rac


ism and persecution. Our fight for equality and 
against injustice against all must continue. 

We must recognize and in some small way 
try to rectify our past. As the famous saying 
goes, ‘‘those who cannot remember the past 
are condemned to repeat it.’’ This Bill will 
serve as a testimony to the great injustices 
that African-Americans suffered at the hands 
of the United States, and subsequently allow 
Members of Congress to learn from the past 
in order to not repeat similar injustices in the 
future. 

The United States today serves as a moral 
compass for the rest of the world and as such 
we must provide a voice for race issues. Our 
willingness to confront our Nation’s past and 
to address the impact which slavery and racial 
segregation have had on our society strengthens 
our undeterred commitment to serving as 
an advocate for human rights and freedom in 
the international community. 

I urge my colleagues to join me in support 
of H.R. 194, ‘‘Apologizing for the enslavement 
and racial segregation of African-Americans.’’ 
This legislation acknowledges the fundamental 
injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of 
slavery and racial segregation in the United 
States. By doing so, the United States will remember 
our Nation’s wrongdoings in order to 
not repeat our mistakes.

TRIBUTE HONORING CORPORAL 
LAWRENCE A. BERGER 

HON. CHARLES A. GONZALEZ 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. GONZALEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Corporal Lawrence A. Berger, 
a man who valiantly served our country in 
World War II and a patriot who is well deserving 
of the recognition he will be receiving 
when he is awarded his upcoming Purple 
Heart. 

Corporal Berger was born on July 13th, 
1922 in San Antonio, Texas. He graduated 
from Central Catholic High School in 1940 and 
a year later, Mr. Berger joined the Army Air 
Corp, 440th Ordnance Aviation Bombardment, 
attached to the 19th bomb group, stationed in 
Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

On October 1941, he was sent to the Philippines, 
arriving just two weeks before the 
Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. Later, after 
the service organizations were forced to surrender, 
he spent a total of 3 years and 3 
months as a prisoner of war. Two years were 
spent in a camp on the Island of Mindanao in 
the Philippines, and later he was transported 
to Japan where he spent another year before 
his release in August 1945. 

Mr. Berger’s service tells an honorable story 
of sacrifice and bravery. He epitomizes the 
word hero and is undoubtedly worthy of the 
recognition he is receiving with the Purple 
Heart award. Mr. Berger, his wife Virginia, and 
their three children Ron, Vernon, and Paulette, 
should all be very proud of all that his military 
career symbolizes and the principles for which 
he fought—for liberty, democracy, and equality. 
I am honored to call him a constituent and 
on behalf of my colleagues here in Congress 
I thank him and his family for their service, 
sacrifice, and valor. 

IN HONOR OF JOE FARROW 

HON. SAM FARR 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. FARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Joe Farrow, the esteemed commissioner 
of the California Highway Patrol. Farrow, 
appointed earlier this year by Governor 
Schwarzenegger, has taken the reigns of one 
of the largest law enforcement agencies in the 
nation. His fervent dedication is evident 
through the great strides he has made in insuring 
the safety of California’s roadways, and 
his work is worthy of commendation. 

Though Farrow is new to the leadership position, 
he is very familiar with the CHP’s mission 
of safety, service, and security. Farrow 
began his career with the CHP as a cadet and 
has since worked his way through the chain of 
command, leaving his indelible mark every 
step of the way. 

Having grown up in Pacific Grove, California, 
he is committed to connecting the local 
community with what many see as just another 
disengaged state government agency. 

Farrow’s ability to relate with both those he 
leads and those he serves has been a beneficial 
asset to the areas of California that have 
been damaged by the recent wildfires. When 
highways are temporarily closed due to the 
fires, the CHP has the duty of redirecting traffic 
to alternate routes. Farrow maintains an 
equal balance of good judgment and compassion 
for those people whose lives have been 
touched by the fires. 

Before taking his post as commissioner, 
Farrow was instrumental in implementing several 
highway safety programs throughout California. 
Most recently, the Safety and Farm Vehicle 
Education (SAFE) program led to an immediate 
and drastic decrease in the number of 
farm workers’ injuries or deaths resulting from 
unsafe transportation to and from the fields. 

Madam Speaker, Farrow is deserving of 
recognition for his years of service with the 
CHP. Please join me in honoring Joe Farrow 
for his contribution to highway safety, as well 
as congratulating him on his new position as 
commissioner of the CHP.

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, on July 14, 
2008, the Crawfordsville High School Baseball 
team won the Indiana Class 3A State championship. 
Ranked number 1 in the preseason 
polls, the Athenians of Crawfordsville finished 
right where they were predicted. 

The 32–4 Athenians went into the championship 
game on a 16 game win streak. 
Strong pitching led the team to its first baseball 
state title. Pitchers Cameron Hobson and 
Steven Rice combined forces to only allow 3 
hits and had 17 strike outs. In fact, Hobson 
tied the 3A championship game record with 5 
innings played and 11 strike outs recorded. 

The Athenians scored single runs in the 
first, second and fourth innings to take commanding 
3–0 lead, and then added two more 
runs on a sacrifice bunt by Brett Linn and an 
RBI single by Brett McKinney. 

For Coach John Froedge, this victory was a 
dream come true. He began coaching the 
Crawfordsville baseball team 27 years ago. 
This was the first time any of his teams had 
made an appearance at the State finals. 

I would like to extend my congratulations to 
the Crawfordsville High School Baseball team

RENEWABLE ENERGY AND 

ENERGY EFFICIENCY EXPO 

HON. LEE TERRY 

OF NEBRASKA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. TERRY. Madam Speaker, one of the 
greatest threats to our national security is our 
country’s dependence on foreign sources of 
oil. We must expand the use of our alternative 
sources of energy and I believe alternative 
fuels is an integral part of that. 

I have introduced a resolution recognizing 
the importance of alternative and renewable 
fuels as well as the role of the flexible fuel vehicle 
club in promoting alternative and renewable 
fuels. Flex fuel cars can run on any blend 
of ethanol and gasoline from E10 to E85. 

Fuel cell technology has many different applications 
from emergency backup generators 
at hospitals and police stations to a pollution 
free replacement for gasoline and diesel engines 
in cars, buses and trucks. Fuel cell technology 
promises to reduce the number of 
large new power plants and transmission lines 
we need to build by allowing the distributed 
generation of electricity across the country. 

One other important aspect is tax credits. 
Research and development in the energy industry 
requires time and money. We must give 
the energy industry the assurance that tax 
benefits will be carried into the future, if we do 
not they will chose to develop elsewhere leaving 
us behind the eight ball. 

In addition, fuel cell technology provides important 
emergency backup power generation 
capability for first responders and our military. 

Over the years I have fought hard to diversify 
our energy supplies and I am not going to 
stop now. You can count on my strong and 
unwavering commitment to make our country 
energy independent once and for all.

RESTORE BALANCE TO TAX 

TREATMENT OF CHARITABLE 

VEHICLE DONATIONS 

HON. WILLIAM D. DELAHUNT 

OF MASSACHUSETTS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. DELAHUNT. Madam Speaker, in 2004, 
the Congress enacted changes in the federal 
tax code intended to address real and perceived 
abuses related to charitable donations 
of vehicles. Those changes, while well-intended, 
have had unanticipated and serious 
consequences. Over the last three years, 
charitable vehicle donations have plummeted. 
The steep decrease in revenue has forced 
many charities—in my state and across the 
country—to reduce services to their beneficiaries. 


The objectives of the 2004 changes were 
commendable. But the specific requirements 
have choked vehicle donations and the charities—
and charitable services—which depend 
on them. Today I am introducing legislation to 
refine those changes in ways that restore better 
balance to this provision of the tax code 
and fulfills the original intent of Congress: to 
promote charitable donations. 

Before 2005, a taxpayer could deduct the 
fair market value (FMV) of vehicles donated to 
charity. Under Section 170 of Title 26 of the 
US Code, a donor could claim the FMV as determined 
by well-established used car pricing 
guides, as long as the FMV was under $5000. 
However, there was concern that some taxpayers 
were gaming the system by claiming 
excessive deductions; and that there was insufficient 
IRS oversight to detect or police 
these problems. 

In its FY2005 budget request, the Administration 
proposed reforming the rules governing 
vehicle donations by allowing a deduction only 
if the taxpayer obtained a qualified appraisal 
for the vehicle. However, the Congress rejected 
that proposal and went much further. 
The final version, included in the American 
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (PL 108–357), limited 
deductions over $500 to the actual proceeds 
of sale of the vehicle by the charity, regardless 
of appraised value. Only if the charity 
actually keeps and uses the car (rather than 
sells it for the resulting revenue) can the donor 
deduct its FMV. 

The rules took effect for tax year 2005. 
Today, a taxpayer with an older used car in 
poor condition can call many charities nationwide 
to have the vehicle towed at no cost and 
then claim a $500 deduction. However, a taxpayer 
with a newer-model car in good condition 
has no idea what deduction will be allowed 
until the vehicle is actually sold. That 
sale may not occur until months later, forcing 
the donor to roll the dice on the final deduction 
amount. 

During congressional debate, proponents argued 
that the changes would not add new burdens 
on vehicle donors or adversely impact 
charitable giving. To the contrary, evidence 
abounds that the changes have seriously disrupted 
charitable giving and forced many charities 
to curtail services to low-income beneficiaries. 


Two new government reports have concluded 
that charitable vehicle donations have 
plummeted since federal tax law changed four 
years ago. In March 2008, a Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) study of 10 national 
charities over the two years after the law 
changed found that vehicle donations had 
dropped by 39 percent and that the resulting 
charitable revenues decreased by 25 percent. 
In May 2008, the Internal Revenue Service 
documented that the number of vehicles donated 
in 2005, the first year after the rules 
changed, decreased by 67 percent and that 
their value fell by over 80 percent. 

To feel informed enough to decide whether 
to donate a vehicle, taxpayers need a reasonable 
degree of certainty about the resulting 
deduction. Otherwise, alternatives such as a 
private sale or dealer trade-in become more 
attractive. This is clearly not what the Congress 
intended. 

The objective of the original 1986 car donation 
provision in the federal tax code was to 
encourage charitable donations. The 2004 
amendments have undermined that goal without 
improving IRS enforcement. As a result, 
charities and their beneficiaries are suffering. 

The change has affected not only the number 
of donations, but also the quality of donated 
vehicles. News articles from across the 
country reflect plummeting donation rates and 
the precipitous decline in revenue of non-profit 
community organizations. The news coverage 
itself has exacerbated the problem; potential 


E1648 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

donors concerned about the changes are discouraged 
further by the perception of the new 
burdens associated with the amended rules. 

Charities which had operated successful vehicle 
donation programs, either independently 
or though third-party fundraisers, have been 
hit hard. Those unable to cover overhead 
costs have eliminated vehicle donation programs 
and resolved to forego the resulting 
revenue stream. It appears that no charities 
have initiated or expanded vehicle donation 
programs over the past two years. 

Contrary to reassurances offered during the 
congressional debate, the tax law changes 
constituted a classic ‘‘baby and bathwater’’ 
overreach that has seriously impacted social 
services provided by non-profit groups across 
the country. Modest tax incentives are critical 
to sustaining charitable contributions, including 
in-kind gifts. The decline in vehicle donations 
since 2004 could be addressed by minor legislative 
refinements that would also address potential 
abuses and buttress IRS enforcement. 

Following are the text and technical analysis 
of my proposed legislation, which I view as a 
starting point for new congressional debate on 
this important issue.

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support 
of this Concurrent Resolution recognizing 
the importance of our Nation’s Caribbean heritage 
and urge its adoption. I would like to 
take this opportunity, in part, to focus attention 
on the provisions of H. Con. Res. 364 that 
highlight the continuing importance of the Caribbean 
region to our Nation. I believe it is important 
that the United States work harder to 
foster our relationships with Caribbean nations 
and support their efforts to enhance the financial 
and geopolitical stability of the region. I recently 
had the opportunity to visit with Dr. 
Emsley D. Tromp, President of the Bank van 
de Nederlandse Antillen, the Central Bank for 
the Netherlands Antilles. During that meeting, 
we had the opportunity to discuss the growing 
importance of our relationship with the Netherlands 
Antilles, which has grown closer, as this 
country has approached independent status 
within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The 
Netherlands Antilles has endeavored to improve 
its security through a more diversified 
economy and favorable environment for additional 
foreign direct investment, particularly 
from the United States. The Netherlands Antilles 
made substantial changes to their tax 
laws, bringing them into compliance with international 
norms. In addition, they entered into 
a tax information exchange agreement (TIEA) 
with the United States and have actively cooperated 
on tax enforcement matters. It is an 
important strategic partner of the United 
States in the Caribbean Basin with shared in


terests in countering transnational terrorism 
and crime and illegal narcotics production. A 
Forward Operating Location (FOL) on Curacao 
provides support for our drug interdiction efforts 
in the region. Madam Speaker, the 
United States should recognize and support 
efforts such as these in the Caribbean region, 
and actively work to forge closer ties with the 
Caribbean nations.

HONORING THE CENTENNIAL OF 

THE UNIVERSITY OF CALI


FORNIA, DAVIS 

HON. MIKE THOMPSON 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today, together with Representatives 
MILLER, M. SPEIER, MATSUI and LUNGREN, 
to mark the 100th anniversary of the 
University of California, Davis. In the past 100 
years, UC Davis has emerged from an agricultural 
outpost into one of the world’s premier 
research universities, and along the way it has 
provided a first-rate education for generations 
of students, including several of my colleagues 
here today. 

UC Davis touches and transforms everything 
that matters to us as human beings—our 
health; the economy; what we eat and drink; 
the ways we live and work together; how we 
find meaning through art, music, and literature; 
and our understanding of the natural world. 
UC Davis is a leading institution of education 
and innovation whose impact is felt around the 
world. 

UC Davis was founded as an agricultural 
extension of the main University of California 
campus at Berkeley to address a lack of in-
state educational opportunities for students of 
agriculture. Governor George Pardee signed 
off on the expansion in 1905, and Davisville 
was quickly selected as the location where the 
campus opened to 18 students in 1909. 
Women joined the student body in 1914. 

In 1959 the Regents of the University of 
California elevated UC Davis to a general 
campus within the University of California system. 
This allowed the campus to develop as 
an institution in its own right, growing into new 
fields and developing its distinctive identity. 
Today, the campus is the largest in the system 
at over 5,300 acres and is internationally 
renowned for its beautiful layout, the extensive 
bike paths, arboretum and the art that enhances 
it throughout. 

In 1966, the university affiliated with Sacramento 
County Hospital and within two years 
the first students were admitted to the UC 
Davis School of Medicine. The UC Davis Medical 
Center is consistently recognized as one 
of the top-50 hospitals in the Nation, and it 
serves as the region’s trauma center. In addition, 
the hospital’s cancer center, children’s 
hospital and M.I.N.D. Institute for 
neurodevelopmental disorders are leaders in 
their respective fields. 

As a research institution, UC Davis remains 
the most vibrant and productive agricultural research 
university in the United States, but it 
has expanded far beyond these roots. The 
faculty and administration are committed to 
providing a rigorous, attentive and research-
oriented campus that has created a world-

class learning environment. Each year, the 
campus welcomes a diverse and talented 
group of students, and it remains a popular 
college destination for students from California 
and beyond—for the 2008 entering class, UC 
Davis received over 42,000 freshman applications, 
a 15 percent increase. With a student 
body of over 30,000, and 178,000 alumni, UC 
Davis has had a wide-spread impact on life in 
our state. 

In 1996, the university joined the prestigious 
Association of American Universities, representing 
the top 62 research universities in 
North America. Research funding, most of 
which is competitively awarded, has risen to 
$600 million annually, including a remarkable 
15 percent jump over the past year. UC 
Davis’s faculty regularly collaborates with leading 
researchers and scientists around the 
world. Recently, the university signed a partnership 
agreement to collaborate with Chilean 
universities on research in viticulture and 
enology, a major industry for California. The 
faculty maintains active research programs in 
a wide variety of fields with importance to the 
state and nation, including 1,500 researchers 
working on a range of environmental issues 
and over 100 engaged in cutting edge discovery 
and innovation in the transportation 
and energy sectors. 

The work of the university has long been 
sustained by generous philanthropy from 
alumni and others supportive of the university’s 
mission. Donors have established more 
than 100 endowed chairs at UC Davis. Recent 
gifts have included $100 million from the Gordon 
and Betty Moore Foundation to launch the 
new Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing; a 
$10 million gift from alumnus Maurice Gallagher 
and his wife Marcia to fund a new building 
(Maurice J. Gallagher Jr. Hall) and an endowment 
for the Graduate School of Management; 
and $35 million from Margrit Mondavi 
and the late Robert Mondavi to help establish 
the Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts 
and the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and 
Food Science. 

Excellence in women’s and men’s athletics 
has long been a proud tradition at UC Davis. 
For its thorough dominance of college athletics 
at the NCAA Division II level, Davis was 
awarded the Sears Cup for best Division II 
athletic program in six of the first eight years 
the award was given. At the Division II level, 
UC Davis won multiple national championships 
including basketball, softball and tennis. 
In 2003, UC Davis undertook the rigorous 
process to move its athletic programs to Division 
1. In 2007, the Aggies gained full Division 
I status after completing the probationary 
study-period and they now compete against 
the finest athletes in the nation. Undoubtedly, 
the most exciting times in this transition were 
the series of upset victories over ‘‘the other 
farm’’ in a variety of sports including football, 
basketball, soccer, wrestling and baseball. 

Madam Speaker, at this time it is appropriate 
that we recognize and congratulate the 
University of California, Davis, on the occasion 
of its centennial. Over the past one hundred 
years, the university has been of incalculable 
benefit to the State of California and our nation 
with its accomplishments across all the 
fields of human endeavor. As an educational 
institution, UC Davis is rightly counted among 
the finest in the country and generations of 
students have benefited from the wisdom and 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1649 

guidance of its faculty. I know that the university 
will continue into its next century as it finished 
its first: a dynamic institution for education 
and research, and a true source of 
pride for Californians. I ask you to join me in 
thanking all the students, staff, administrators 
and faculty, past and present, for their accomplishments 
and continued hard work.

SUPPORTING NATIONAL NIGHT 
OUT 

SPEECH OF 

HON. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, July 29, 2008 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker. 
I support this resolution and encourage my 
colleagues to do the same. This resolution is 
important today as Americans are desirous of 
making America a better, safer place. This 
resolution recognizes the importance of community 
policing and crime prevention. 

Because the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice 
Assistance Grant (Byrne-JAG) Program at 
fiscal year have been severely cut in America, 
we must be vigilant and ensure that America 
and our neighborhoods remain safe. The 
Byrne-JAG monies are supposed to be used 
to make America a safer place. 

Byrne-JAG allows states and local governments 
to support a broad range of activities to 
prevent and control crime and to improve the 
criminal justice system, which states and local 
governments have come to rely on to ensure 
public safety. They support: law enforcement, 
prosecution and court programs, prevention 
and education, corrections and community 
programs, drug treatment, planning, evaluation, 
technology improvement programs, and 
crime victim and witness programs (other than 
compensation). In short, they are an indispensable 
resource that states use to combat 
crime. 

Unfortunately, in fiscal year 2008 the Byrne-
JAG program was cut by two-thirds. Although 
Congress authorized over $1 billion, only $520 
million were appropriated for fiscal year 2007. 
The appropriation was then drastically reduced 
to $170.4 million in fiscal year 2008, and the 
President has proposed further cuts for the fiscal 
year 2009 budget. 

The continuing cuts seem to indicate that information 
regarding the success of the program 
has not been brought to the attention of 
members of Congress or to the Administration. 
Therefore, H. Res. 1324, recognizes that the 
President should focus on neighborhood crime 
prevention. 

The trend to reduce the grant funding may 
result, in part, from instances where Byrne-
JAG funding has been abused. For example, 
in 1999 Byrne-JAG funding was used in the 
infamous Tulia outrage in which a rogue police 
narcotics officer in Texas set up dozens of 
people, most of them African-American, in 
false cocaine trafficking charges. In other instances, 
jurisdictions used the funding to fund 
task forces focused solely on ineffective, low-
level drug arrests, which has put the task 
force concept-and the diminished standards of 
drug enforcement that it has come to represent-
in the national spotlight. 

The most well-known Byrne-funded scandal 
occurred in Tulia, Texas where dozens of Afri


can American residents (representing 16 percent 
of the town’s black population) were arrested, 
prosecuted and sentenced to decades 
in prison, even though the only evidence 
against them was the uncorroborated testimony 
of one white undercover officer with a 
history of lying and racism. The undercover officer 
worked alone, and had no audiotapes, 
video surveillance, or eyewitnesses to collaborate 
his allegations. Suspicions eventually 
arose after two of the accused defendants 
were able to produce firm evidence showing 
they were out of state or at work at the time 
of the alleged drug buys. Texas Governor Rick 
Perry eventually pardoned the Tulia defendants 
(after four years of imprisonment), but 
these kinds of scandals continue to plague the 
Byrne grant program. 

These scandals are not the result of a few 
‘‘bad apples’’ in law enforcement; they are the 
result of a fundamentally flawed bureaucracy 
that is prone to corruption by its very structure. 
Byrne-funded regional anti-drug task forces 
are federally funded, state managed, and locally 
staffed, which means they do not really 
have to answer to anyone. In fact, their ability 
to perpetuate themselves through asset forfeiture 
and federal funding makes them unaccountable 
to local taxpayers and governing 
bodies. 

But, reducing the funding is not the answer. 
Instead, we should encourage the President to 
invest in America and keep our neighborhoods 
safe, H. Res. 1324 does just that. I urge my 
colleagues to support it.

RECOGNIZING MARIAN MEDICAL 

CENTER’S CO-GENERATION EN


ERGY PLANT 

HON. LOIS CAPPS 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Marian Medical Center, located 
in Santa Maria, California, and in my congressional 
district, for the recent completion of a 
new Co-Generation Energy Plant. This truly is 
a win-win project that will benefit our community 
and the environment. 

With skyrocketing energy costs, it’s very important 
now that we develop alternative methods 
of generating electricity. The Marian Medical 
Center Co-Generation Energy Plant system 
works by capturing toxic methane gas 
run-off from the Santa Maria Municipal Landfill 
and piping it to an energy plant recently built 
on the hospital campus where it is converted 
to clean electrical energy. 

Piping gas from the landfill to power the 
hospital will significantly reduce methane 
emissions and offset the use of non-renewable 
resources, such as natural gas and oil. The 
energy plant will also result in significant energy 
and cost savings for the hospital. It will 
supply all but 50 kilowatts of the energy necessary 
to power the medical center and is expected 
to achieve an annual electrical cost 
savings of nearly $350,000. Finally, the cogeneration 
project will provide benefits to the City 
of Santa Maria, which will be able to make 
use of and receive revenue for an otherwise 
unused, potentially toxic resource. 

I am so proud that Marian Medical Center is 
one of only a handful of healthcare facilities in 

the nation to be powered by co-generated energy. 
This project is the result of a unique 
partnership and I want to commend Marian 
Medical Center and the City of Santa Maria for 
serving as a role model for other organizations 
in our community.

RECOGNIZING THE SPECIAL 
OLYMPICS 40TH ANNIVERSARY 

SPEECH OF 

HON. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 
1279, ‘‘Recognizing the Special Olympics 40th 
anniversary’’. First, I would like to thank my 
distinguished colleague, LEE TERRY of Nebraska, 
for introducing this important piece of 
legislation. This resolution will recognize the 
significance of the Special Olympics in establish 
lasting competitive bonds and teaching the 
world that all people possess the same courage 
and profound joy in the face of athletic 
competition. Through its 40 years the Special 
Olympics has dedicated itself to empowering 
individuals with intellectual disabilities to become 
physically fit, productive, and respected 
members of society through sports training 
and competition. I strongly encourage my colleagues 
to support this act. 

The Special Olympics currently serves over 
2,500,000 people with intellectual disabilities in 
more than 200 programs in over 180 countries. 
The organization has over 700,000 volunteers 
and 500,000 coaches worldwide. Indeed, 
every four years the Special Olympics 
requires a massive undertaking of athletes, 
volunteers and coaches. Throughout all this 
the organization has stood true to its oath ‘‘Let 
me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave 
in the attempt’’. Indeed, the bravery of the 
Special Olympics and its intellectually disabled 
athletes is inspiring, and well worth this commendation. 


This bill recognizes not only the importance 
of an organization such as the Special Olympics, 
but also its effects. Children and adults 
with intellectual disabilities who participate in 
Special Olympics develop improved physical 
fitness and motor skills, greater self-confidence 
and a more positive self-image. These 
competitors grow not only physically, but mentally, 
and emotionally. In the process new 
powerful ties are made between individuals 
and between nations regardless of the barriers 
of language and geography. 

This legislation will express the desire of 
Congress to recognize the tireless compassion 
of those volunteers and coaches working with 
the Special Olympics, as well as the 
unshakeable bravery of its athletes. Through 
its 40 years of service the Special Olympics 
has helped millions of intellectually disabled 
children and adults to find their true voice. 

Whether it is through their 40 years of international 
competition, or their work regionally, 
where chapters such as Special Olympics 
Texas work to bring out both athleticism and 
joy from the intellectually disabled in 21 
sports, this organization has shown a commitment 
to bringing out the best in both volunteer 
and competitor alike. To think that from a 
small summer day camp for intellectually challenged 
children and adults could evolve into a 


E1650 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

world-wide organization, is a testament to the 
lasting vision of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, its 
founder, and the commitment of volunteers, 
such as the 40,000 from Texas, to this dream.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH 

ANNIVERSARY OF SPAAMFAA 

HON. JAMES T. WALSH 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary 
of the Society for the Preservation and Appreciation 
for Motorized Fire Apparatus in America 
(SPAAMFAA). 

In 1958, SPAAMFAA was founded in Syracuse, 
New York by Dick Horstmann to serve 
as a way to preserve antique fire apparatus 
and promote an appreciation for fire service 
history. Since its conception the society has 
grown to include more than 3,000 members in 
over 50 chapters across the globe and it is still 
going strong today. 

On behalf of the people of the 25th district 
of New York I congratulate Dick Horstmann 
and all the members of SPAAMFAA for a successful 
50 years and wish them continued 
success in the future.

TRIBUTE TO GEORGE F. ROZELLE 

HON. KEVIN BRADY 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of George F. 
Rozelle III. Mr. Rozelle recently left this earth 
and joined his Heavenly Father. 

A native of Fort Worth, Texas, Mr. Rozelle 
was a proud Texan and Longhorn fan even 
when life took him to other parts of the country. 
After growing up in Arlington and attending 
Arlington High School he went on to graduate 
from the University of Texas at Arlington. The 
business degree he earned at UT—Arlington 
served him well as he quickly started his career 
with the Junior Chamber of Commerce 
and began to climb the Chamber ladder. 

After moving to Arizona and marrying Marty, 
he joined the Fiesta Bowl Committee in 1979. 
He played a critical role in turning the Fiesta 
Bowl into one of the premier sporting events 
in the world; he served on the Board of Directors 
for six years. 

Mr. Rozelle’s lifelong passion was serving 
others and his community. Besides his time 
with the Fiesta Bowl, he was the President of 
the Arizona Club, Executive Director of the Arizona 
chapter of the American Roads and 
Transportation Builder’s Association and spent 
time with the Arizona Corporation Commission. 


Mr. Rozelle was best known for his smile, 
easy going sense of humor, and his ability to 
make everyone feel comfortable. His friends 
and family will also miss his skill in the kitchen; 
a true gourmet, he was written up in the 
Arizona Republic for his ability and participation 
in a local gourmet cooking group. 

George is survived by his loving and faithful 
wife of 31 years, Dr. Martha Rozelle, their 

daughters, Deborah and Vicki; son George; 
granddaughters Brooke, Janessa, Joni, Julie, 
Katy; and grandsons, Chris and Braydn. 

Madam Speaker, I thank the House of Representatives 
and America for joining me in 
honoring the life of George F. Rozelle III and 
offering our prayers and condolences to his 
family and friends.

MCCUTCHEON HIGH SCHOOL SOFT


BALL TEAM—INDIANA STATE 

CHAMPIONS 

HON. STEVE BUYER 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. BUYER. Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, 
June 10, 2008 the McCutcheon High School 
Softball team won the Indiana 4A softball state 
title. The Mavericks of McCutcheon narrowly 
defeated Franklin Central High School 2–1. 

This was McCutcheon’s first state championship 
in any girls sport though this year 
marked their third state finals and second 
championship game in four years. 

This victory did not come easy for 
McCutcheon. Mother Nature intervened in 
their path to the championship. On Friday, 
June 6, 2008 lightning forced the semifinal 
game to be postponed. The next day, rain 
washed the game out. Finally, on Sunday they 
were able to start their semifinal game against 
LaPorte only to have it suspended after 4 innings. 
When the game was suspended, the 
Mavs had the lead. 

Due to the weather, the Lady Mavs were 
forced to play a doubleheader on Tuesday. 
They finished their semifinal game against 
LaPorte, and then carried that momentum into 
the State Championship game against Franklin 
Central. 

It is difficult to play a doubleheader under 
any circumstances, much less a championship 
atmosphere, but McCutcheon was up for the 
challenge. They were trailing in the bottom of 
the fourth inning when junior Tristan Wilcox 
knocked in the tying run with an RBI single, 
and then Maggie Tull scored the go-ahead 
run. 

Pitcher Tori Collins was able to secure the 
victory by holding Franklin Central off to 5 hits 
and struck out 11 batters the whole game. 
These young ladies showed amazing determination 
against adversity and drive. After 
three years of almost achieving the ultimate 
victory, the Mavs achieved their ultimate goal. 

I would like to extend my congratulations to 
the McCutcheon High School softball team 
and coaching staff: 

Seniors: Tori Collins, Kristen Garza, Kendra 
Julian and Maggie Tull. Juniors: Maggie 
House, Brittany Keller, Megan Millikan, Angel 
Neal, Kelsey Rummel, Kaylee Smith, Meg

the Armstrong Atlantic State University’s 
men’s and women’s tennis teams. 
Both squads were named National Champions 
in the 2008 NCAA Division II Tennis Tournament 
held on May 17th in Houston, Texas. 

It is rare for one university to obtain two national 
titles in the same season much less the 
same sport, but the Pirates managed to accomplish 
this feat. Brigham Young University 
was the last school to achieve such success 
in 2003. 

The Lady Pirates beat Lynn University of 
Boca Raton, Florida, to achieve their fourth 
National Championship. The undefeated 
Men’s team swept Barry University of Miami 
Shores, Florida, earning the University its first 
ever NCAA title in Men’s athletics. 

Both teams are coached by Simon 
Earnshaw. 

I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER


SARY OF BEN’S CHILI BOWL 

HON. JOE WILSON 

OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, fifty years ago, on August 22, 1958, 
newlyweds Virginia and Ben Ali opened what 
is regarded now as a culinary landmark in 
Washington, D.C., Ben’s Chili Bowl. The Ali 
family encountered numerous hardships on 
the way to establishing this neighborhood restaurant 
as a cultural symbol of camaraderie, 
tolerance and endurance. Ben’s Chili Bowl became 
famous by consistently providing quality 
food for half a century such as their famous 
chili, half-smoke sausages, hamburgers and 
milkshakes. Over the years, the menu has expanded 
to include vegetarian options and a 
full breakfast. Celebrities such as Bill Cosby 
and Denzel Washington have visited the establishment, 
raising its national profile. 

Ben’s Chili Bowl is now one of the most 
successful, longest-operating African-American 
owned businesses in America. The restaurant 
is expanding with Ben’s II opening next door 
to their longtime establishment along with a 
restaurant located in the Washington Nationals’ 
new stadium. Further, a book commemorating 
the 50th anniversary of Ben’s Chili Bowl 
will be released in August 2008. 

Ben and Virginia Ali were inducted into the 
District of Columbia Hall of Fame in 1991, and 
while they have retired, their sons Kamal and 
Nizam are successfully carrying the family’s 
business into the future. Congratulations to 
Ben, Virginia, Kamal and Nizam Ali for their 
family’s work ethic, dedication and commitment 
to making Ben’s Chili Bowl an American 
symbol of small business success for the past 
50 years.

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 4255, the 
‘‘United States Olympic Committee Paralympic 
Program Act of 2008.’’ First, I would like to 
thank my distinguished colleague, BOB FILNER 
of California, for introducing this important legislation. 
This bill will give a grant to the USOC 
for the planning, developing, management and 
implementation of a Paralympic program for 
physically disabled veterans and members of 
the United States Armed Forces. I strongly encourage 
my colleagues to support this act. 

There are currently over 2.9 million disabled 
veterans. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan 
have contributed to a 25 percent raise in this 
number since 2001. Many are struggling to rehabilitate, 
to cope, and to regain their purpose. 
We must staunchly support our soldiers and 
veterans by giving them the opportunity to 
again represent our country with pride. 

It may be impossible to ever fully repay the 
services that the many brave men and women 

of the United States Armed Forces have given 
for our country, but it is critical that we do 
what we can to support those that were injured 
and disabled in our defense. H.R. 4255 
will help to provide the many physically disabled 
veterans and servicemembers with an 
outreach program of encouragement and support 
that will allow them to represent their 
country as athletes and ambassadors of goodwill. 


Upon enactment of the act, the Secretary of 
Veteran Affairs will be authorized to make a 
grant to the U.S. Olympic Committee, USOC, 
to plan, develop, manage, and implement the 
Paralympic Program for veterans and members 
of the Armed Forces. The bill directs the 
USOC to use the grant to plan, develop, manage, 
and implement the Paralympic Program 
for veterans and members of the Armed 
Forces. 

The Paralympic Program that this bill establishes 
will benefit the millions of disabled veterans 
and members of the Armed Forces. 
This bill will allow many servicemembers to 
experience the pride of representing their Nation, 
and will provide many more with the outreach 
and support network necessary to rehabilitate 
and regain their strength. 

At the time of the 2000 census there were 

1.75 million veterans living in Texas. Many 
from Houston and Texas’ 18th have served. It 
is in memory of their service that I ask my colleagues 
to support this bill, giving our disabled 
veterans and servicemembers a chance to 
represent our Nation through their competitive 
spirits.

A TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF 
ABRAHAM SHEINGOLD 

HON. JIM COSTA 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to the life of a special man, Abraham 
Sheingold of Monterey, California. Abraham 
recently passed away at the age of 91 
years old. He leaves behind his loving wife of 
66 years, Sylvia, his son Larry and his daughter 
Janet. 

Mr. Sheingold was born on February 17, 
1917 in New York City. He earned his bachelor 
of arts and masters degree from the City 
College of New York. Abe joined the faculty of 
the Naval Postgraduate School in 1946, migrating 
with the school to Monterey when it 
was moved there from Annapolis in 1951. He 
was a professor of electronics, department 
chair and dean of academic admissions until 
his retirement in 1986. 

Abe was a gifted teacher. His command of 
the English language coupled with his gentle 
manner and sense of humor made him a favorite 
with students and prompted frequent invitations 
to speak at Navy School functions, 
both during his tenure at the school and after 
his retirement. His knowledge of subject matter 
was evident in the textbook he wrote. 
These accomplishments contributed to his receiving 
the honor of Distinguished Professor. 

Abe continued his involvement in the Naval 
Postgraduate School after his retirement 
through his service on the board of the Naval 
School Foundation, where he set up scholarship 
funds and honoria for faculty members. In 


E1652 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

addition, he helped establish Congregation 
Beth Israel on the Monterey Peninsula during 
the early fifties. He was an active member of 
the congregation, serving several terms as its 
president. 

Abe loved to travel. He and his wife, Sylvia, 
took trips throughout the United States and 
traveled to Europe, Asia, Israel, Australia, New 
Zealand, Mexico and Canada. The couple 
moved to Sacramento 2 years ago to be near 
their children. He is remembered by his family 
and friends from around the country and the 
residents and caregivers at Sunrise Assisted 
Living in Sacramento. 

It goes without saying that Mr. Abraham 
Sheingold was an honorable man with a commitment 
to his family, friends and community 
that will forever live in the lives of the people 
he so graciously touched. My heart goes out 
Abraham’s wife and children. I am honored 
and humbled to join his family in celebrating 
the life of this amazing man who will never be 
forgotten.

HONORING CHIEF DEPUTY U.S. 

MARSHAL JOHN DUKE BUTLER 

HON. CHARLES A. GONZALEZ 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. GONZALEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor John Duke Butler, Chief Deputy 
United States Marshal for the Western District 
of Texas, as he enters the beginning 
stage of his retirement. Mr. Butler’s lifelong 
commitment to public service, demonstrated 
by his 32-year career in Federal law enforcement, 
is worthy of much praise and recognition. 


Mr. Butler began his career in May of 1976 
when he became Deputy U.S. Marshal in Minnesota. 
Over time, he held various Federal 
law enforcement roles and in 1995 became 
the Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal for the Western 
District of Texas. He served here until his retirement 
in July of 2008. 

Throughout his career, his commitment to 
his community stretched beyond Federal law 
enforcement, as he was an active member of 
various volunteer associations, including local 
chapters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
National Academy Associates for 25 
years. 

Mr. Butler’s admirable lifelong commitment 
to public service and Federal law enforcement 
has set a great example for each and every 
community in which he has resided. I am 
proud to call him a constituent, and on behalf 
of my colleagues here in Congress, thank Mr. 
Butler and his family, including his wife Shannon 
and their children Juliette and Cecilia, for 
his lifelong service, community involvement, 
and commitment to justice and law enforcement.

PSORIASIS ACT 

HON. DAVID WU 

OF OREGON 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. WU. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
bring attention to the serious, debilitating, 

chronic diseases of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, 
and to urge you to support H.R. 1188, 
the Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Research, 
Cure, and Care Act for 2007—important bipartisan 
legislation that I have introduced with my 
colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. GERLACH. 

This legislation would be the first ever legislative 
action to fill important gaps in psoriasis 
and psoriatic arthritis data collection and research, 
and is an important step in providing 
relief to the as many as 7.5 million Americans 
that the National Institutes of Health estimates 
suffer from these noncontagious, genetic auto-
immune diseases. 

Psoriasis is widely misunderstood, minimized, 
and undertreated. In addition to the 
pain, itching, and bleeding caused by psoriasis, 
many affected individuals also experience 
social discrimination and stigma. Of serious 
concern is that people with psoriasis are 
at elevated risk for myriad co-morbidities, including 
but not limited to, heart disease, diabetes, 
obesity, and mental health conditions. 
As such, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis impose 
significant burdens on individuals and 
society; psoriasis alone is estimated to cost 
the Nation 56 million hours of lost work and 
between $2 billion and $3 billion annually. 

Also, I wish to take a moment to recognize 
that August is National Psoriasis Awareness 
Month and commend the National Psoriasis 
Foundation, headquartered in my district, for 
its annual efforts surrounding National Psoriasis 
Awareness Month. Moreover, I thank the 
foundation leaders and staff for working tirelessly 
each day to help our Nation make 
progress toward a cure and to ensure that 
people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis 
have access to the care they need and deserve. 


On average, each of us has 17,000 constituents 
with psoriasis. As most of us will be 
at home frequently this fall, I encourage my 
colleagues to meet with affected constituents, 
learn more about psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, 
and work to reduce the misconceptions 
surrounding these conditions. I further urge 
you to join with me and the other 82 cosponsors 
in supporting people living with psoriasis 
by cosponsoring H.R. 1188.

CELEBRATING THE WORK OF 
MADAM ANNIE B. DANIELS 

HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the life and work of a 
treasured citizen of the Commonwealth of Virginia, 
Madam Annie B. Daniels. The year 
2008 marks the 50th year Madam Daniels has 
operated her business on Chestnut Avenue in 
Newport News. In recognition of both this anniversary 
and her many civic accomplishments, 
I would like to say a few words about 
this remarkable woman. 

Annie B. Daniels was born in Grove Hill, 
Alabama. At an early age, Madam Daniels 
had the desire to become a hairdresser, having 
been inspired by her great aunt Lady Bell 
Pugh, a local hairdresser. Madam Daniels 
began her formal beautician training at the 
Barnett Institute in Grove Hill and continued at 
the Freeman Beauty School of Savannah, 

Georgia. She moved to Newport News, Virginia, 
and enrolled in the Spratley Beauty College. 
Upon graduation, she worked in privately 
owned salons until she opened her singularly 
owned and operated beauty parlor on 1309 
30th Street in 1948. 

Although the ability to operate her own 
salon was empowering, Madam Daniels was 
unsatisfied with her first business and in 1958 
she established the Madam Daniels’ Salon at 
2901 Chestnut Avenue. A year later she 
added an educational component to the salon 
and the Madam Daniels’ School of Beauty 
Culture was born. Starting with just four students 
and a basic course of study, the school 
has grown tremendously in both enrollment 
and curriculum. Madam Daniels’ School of 
Beauty Culture is a fixture of the southeastern 
Newport News community, and its graduates 
have gone on to make their mark in the beauty 
industry around the world. 

Hand in hand with her entrepreneurial work, 
Madam Daniels has been an important advocate 
for civil rights and social justice in Virginia. 
She was active in the Civil Rights Movement 
in Virginia, becoming the first fully paid 
female life member of the Newport News 
branch of the NAACP. For over a decade she 
chaired the local life membership committee, 
and through her efforts to increase life memberships, 
the branch was nationally recognized. 


Madam Daniels’s civic engagement has 
been recognized by the City of Newport News, 
the NAACP, Hampton University, the Urban 
League of Hampton Roads, the Peninsula 
Chapter of 100 Black Men of America, and the 
Virginia General Assembly. Her advice and 
counsel are actively sought by local mayors, 
city council members, and state and national 
representatives, including myself. I congratulate 
Madam Daniels on her 50 years as a successful 
entrepreneur and for her 50 years of 
commitment and service to her community, 
state, and country.

SECRETARY ROBERT GATES’ REMARKS 
AT THE U.S. GLOBAL 
LEADERSHIP CAMPAIGN TRIBUTE 
DINNER 

HON. HOWARD L. BERMAN 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, on July 15, 
the Secretary of Defense, Robert M. Gates, 
was honored at the annual Tribute Dinner of 
the U.S. Global Leadership Campaign, 
USGLC, for his leadership in supporting our 
Government’s foreign affairs budget. The 
USGLC has been an important organization 
supporting adequate funding levels for the 
conduct of our country’s foreign affairs and 
international assistance programs. Secretary 
of State Condoleezza Rice introduced Secretary 
Gates and acknowledged his contributions. 


In his remarks, Secretary Gates strongly advocated 
for a robust civilian capacity within the 

U.S. Government: ‘‘When it comes to America’s 
engagement with the rest of the world, it 
is important that the military is—and is clearly 
seen to be—in a supporting role to civilian 
agencies.’’ In order to further U.S. national security, 
Secretary Gates argued that our civilian 
institutions of diplomacy and development 

August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1653 

must be adequately staffed and properly funded. 
It is a message that Secretary Gates has 
been giving to the American people and to our 
nation’s leadership here in Washington. 

wholeheartedly agree with Secretary 
Gates’ thoughtful statement and welcome his 
support for rebuilding the US civilian diplomatic 
and development capacity. Over the last 
four months, I have held a number of hearings 
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on reforming 
American foreign assistance programs 
and rebuilding our civilian capacity. We will be 
having another hearing on this issue in September. 


Madam Speaker, the next Congress and the 
next Administration will have to take on the 
necessary, but difficult task of reforming our 
foreign assistance programs, and equally important, 
improving the diplomatic and development 
functions within our government. I look 
forward to this job that lies ahead of us. 

Madam Speaker, I ask that the full text of 
Secretary Gates’ remarks to the U.S. Global 
Leadership Campaign be placed in The 
RECORD, and I urge my colleagues to give 
careful attention to the Secretary’s thoughtful 
speech. 

AMERICA’S VOICE FOR SECURITY, PROSPERITY, 
AND HUMANITARIAN VALUES—REMARKS BY 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT M. GATES 
AT USGLC TRIBUTE DINNER, JULY 15, 2008 

Thank you very much for the introductions. 
Thank you Condi Rice for the kind 
words, and above all, for your principled and 
visionary leadership of the Department of 
State. 

One of the reasons I have rarely been invited 
to lecture in political science departments—
including at Texas A&M—is because 
faculty correctly suspect that I would tell 
the students that what their textbooks say 
about government does not describe the reality 
I have experienced in working for seven 
presidents. Organization charts, institutions, 
statistics, structures, regulations, policies, 
committees, and all the rest—the bureaucracy, 
if you will—are the necessary pre-condition 
for effective government. But whether 
or not it really works depends upon the people 
and their relationships. For significant 
periods since I entered government 42 years 
ago, the Secretary of State and Secretary of 
Defense were not on speaking terms. The 
fact that Condi and I actually get along 
means that our respective bureaucracies understand 
that trying to provoke us to fight 
with one another is not career-enhancing. 
Such efforts still occur, of course. After all, 
this is Washington. But the bureaucratic 
battles are a good deal more covert. 

Of course, the human side of government is 
always a source of both humor and embarrassment. 
Will Rogers once said, ‘‘I don’t 
make jokes. I just watch the government and 
report the facts.’’ And the conduct of diplomacy, 
where—as Secretary Rice can attest— 
protocol and propriety are so very important, 
provides an especially fertile ground 
for amusement. 

For example, there was the time that 
President Nixon met with Israeli Prime Minister 
Golda Meir, shortly after Nixon had appointed 
Henry Kissinger as Secretary of 
State. With Golda Meir in that meeting was 
her very erudite foreign minister, Abba 
Eban, a graduate of Cambridge. At one point 
in the meeting, Nixon turned to Golda Meir 
and said, ‘‘Just think, we now both have 
Jewish foreign ministers.’’ And without 
missing a beat Golda Meir said, ‘‘Yes, but 
mine speaks English.’’ 

Then there was the time that President 
Nixon visited Italy and had a meeting with 
the Pope. Kissinger and Nixon had along 

with them Secretary of Defense Mel Laird, 
but they decided that Laird as, in effect, secretary 
of war shouldn’t be invited to a meeting 
with the Pope. So, Nixon the next morning 
went in for his private audience with the 
Pope, and the other Americans waited outside 
for the general audience. And who 
should come striding down the hall of the 
papal apartments but Mel Laird smoking an 
enormous cigar, he had decided he wanted in 
on the meeting. Kissinger was beside himself, 
but finally said, ‘‘Well, Mel, at least extinguish 
the cigar.’’ And so Laird stubbed 
out his cigar and put it in his pocket. 

The rest of the American party a few minutes 
later went in to their meeting with the 
Pope, everyone took a seat. A couple of minutes 
into the Pope’s remarks, Kissinger 
heard this little patting sound going on, he 
was in the second row with Laird on the end, 
there was a wisp of smoke coming out of 
Laird’s pocket. Everything seemed under 
control. A couple of minutes later, Kissinger 
heard this loud slapping noise. He looked 
over smoke was billowing out of Laird’s 
pocket. The Secretary of Defense was on fire. 
Now the rest of the delegation heard this 
slapping noise, and they thought they were 
being cued to applaud the Pope. And so they 
did. And Henry later told us, ‘‘God only 
knows what his Holiness thought, seeing the 
American secretary of defense immolating 
himself, and the entire American party applauding 
the fact.’’ 

I am honored to receive this award, and I 
consider it a privilege to be associated with 
the United States Global Leadership Campaign. 
It is a truly remarkable collection of 
‘‘strange bedfellows’’—from Save the Children 
to Caterpillar, from Catholic Relief 
Services to AIPAC, and even Boeing and Northrop 
Grumman. This organization has been 
a prescient, and often lonely, advocate for 
the importance of diplomacy and international 
development to America’s vital national 
interests—and I commend you for 
that. 

Though my views on these subjects have 
become better known through recent speeches, 
in many ways they originated and were 
reinforced by my prior experience in government 
during the Cold War. Looking back, it 
is clear that the strength of America’s military 
forces and intelligence capabilities— 
along with the willingness to use them—held 
the Soviets at bay for more than four decades. 
But there was another side to that 
story and to that struggle. There was the 
Agency for International Development overseeing 
development and humanitarian assistance 
programs that improved—if not saved— 
the lives of millions of people from disease, 
starvation, and poverty. Our diplomats 
forged relationships and bonds of trust, and 
built up reservoirs of expertise and goodwill 
that proved invaluable over time. Countless 
people in foreign countries wandered into a 
United States Information Agency library, 
or heard from a visiting speaker and had 
their opinions about America transformed by 
learning about our history and culture and 
values. Others behind the Iron Curtain were 
inspired to resist by what they heard on 
Radio Free Europe and the Voice of America. 

In all, these non-military efforts—these 
tools of persuasion and inspiration—were indispensable 
to the outcome of the defining 
ideological struggle of the 20th century. I believe 
that they are just as indispensable in 
the 21st century—and maybe more so. 

Just last month I approved a new National 
Defense Strategy that calls upon us to ‘‘Tap 
the full strength of America and its people’’—
military and civilian, public and private—
to deal with the challenges to our freedom, 
prosperity, and security around the 
globe. 

In the campaign against terrorist networks 
and other extremists, we know that direct 

military force will continue to have a role. 
But over the long term, we cannot kill or 
capture our way to victory. What the Pentagon 
calls ‘‘kinetic’’ operations should be 
subordinate to measures to promote participation 
in government, economic programs to 
spur development, and efforts to address the 
grievances that often lie at the heart of 
insurgencies and among the discontented 
from which the terrorists recruit. It will 
take the patient accumulation of quiet successes 
over time to discredit and defeat extremist 
movements and their ideology. 

We also know that over the next 20 years 
and more certain pressures—population, resource, 
energy, climate, economic, and environmental—
could combine with rapid cultural, 
social, and technological change to 
produce new sources of deprivation, rage, 
and instability. We face now, and will inevitably 
face in the future, rising powers discontented 
with the international status quo, 
possessing new wealth and ambition, and 
seeking new and more powerful weapons. 
But, overall, looking ahead, I believe the 
most persistent and potentially dangerous 
threats will come less from ambitious states, 
than failing ones that cannot meet the basic 
needs—much less the aspirations—of their 
people. 

In my travels to foreign capitals, I have 
been struck by the eagerness of so many foreign 
governments to forge closer diplomatic 
and security ties with the United States— 
ranging from old enemies like Vietnam to 
new partners like India. Nonetheless, regard 
for the United States is low among the populations 
of many key nations—especially 
those of our moderate Muslim allies. 

This is important because much of our national 
security strategy depends upon securing 
the cooperation of other nations, which 
will depend heavily on the extent to which 
our efforts abroad are viewed as legitimate 
by their publics. The solution is not to be 
found in some slick PR campaign or by trying 
to out-propagandize al-Qaeda, but rather 
through the steady accumulation of actions 
and results that build trust and credibility 
over time. 

To do all these things, to truly harness the 
‘‘full strength of America,’’ as I said in the 
National Defense Strategy, requires having 
civilian institutions of diplomacy and development 
that are adequately staffed and properly 
funded. Due to the leadership of Secretary 
Rice and before her Secretary Powell, 
and with the continuing strong support of 
the President, we have made significant 
progress towards pulling ourselves out of the 
hole created not only by the steep cutbacks 
in the wake of the Cold War—but also by the 
lack of adequate resources for the State Department 
and the entire foreign affairs account 
going back decades. 

Since 2001, international affairs spending 
has about doubled, State has begun hiring 
again, billions have been spent to fight AIDS 
and malaria in Africa, the Millennium Challenge 
Corporation is rewarding better governance 
in the developing world, and Secretary 
Rice has launched a program of transformational 
diplomacy to better posture the 
diplomatic corps for the realities of this century. 
The President’s budget request this 
year, as Condi said, includes more than 1,100 
new Foreign Service officers, as well as a response 
corps of civilian experts that can deploy 
on short notice. And, for the first time 
in a long time, I sense real bipartisan support 
in Congress for strengthening the civilian 
foreign affairs budget. 

Shortfalls nonetheless remain. Much of the 
total increase in the international affairs 
budget has been taken up by security costs 
and offset by the declining dollar, leaving 
little left over for core diplomatic operations. 
These programs are not well understood 
or appreciated by the wider American 


E1654 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

public, and do not have a ready-made political 
constituency that major weapons systems 
or public works projects enjoy. As a result, 
the slashing of the President’s international 
affairs budget request has too often 
become an annual Washington ritual—right 
up there with the blooming of the cherry 
blossoms and the Redskins’ opening game. 

As someone who once led an agency with a 
thin domestic constituency, I am familiar 
with this dilemma. Since arriving at the 
Pentagon I’ve discovered a markedly different 
budget dynamic—not just in scale but 
the reception one gets on the Hill. Congress 
often asks the military services for lists of 
things that they need, but that the Defense 
Secretary and the President were too stingy 
to request. As you can imagine, this is one 
congressional tasking that prompts an immediate 
and enthusiastic response. 

It has become clear that America’s civilian 
institutions of diplomacy and development 
have been chronically undermanned and underfunded 
for far too long—relative to what 
we spend on the military, and more important, 
relative to the responsibilities and 
challenges our nation has around the world. 
I cannot pretend to know the right dollar 
amount—I know it’s a good deal more than 
the one percent of the federal budget that it 
is right now. But the budgets we are talking 
about are relatively small compared to the 
rest of government, a steep increase of these 
capabilities is well within reach—as long as 
there is the political will and wisdom to do 
it. 

But even as we agree that more resources 
are needed, I believe that there is more to 
this problem than how much money is in the 
150 Account. The challenge we face is how 
best to integrate these tools of statecraft 
with the military, international partners, 
and the private sector. 

Where our government has been able to 
bring America’s civilian and the military assets 
together to support local partners, there 
have been incredibly promising results. One 
unheralded example, one you will not read 
about in the newspapers, is in the Philippines. 
There the U.S. Ambassador—Kristie 
Kenney—has overseen a campaign involving 
multiple agencies working closely together 
with their Philippine counterparts in a synchronized 
effort that has delegitimized and 
rolled back extremists in Mindanao. Having 
a strong, well-supported chief of mission has 
been crucial to success. 

The vastly larger, more complex international 
effort in Afghanistan presents a different 
set of challenges. There are dozens of 
nations, hundreds of NGOs, universities, development 
banks, the United Nations, the 
European Union, NATO—all working to help 
a nation beset by crushing poverty, a bumper 
opium crop, and a ruthless and resilient insurgency. 
Getting all these different elements 
to coordinate operations and share 
best practices has been a colossal—and often 
all too often unsuccessful—undertaking. The 
appointment this spring of a UN special representative 
to coordinate civilian reconstruction 
in Afghanistan is an important 
step forward. And at the last NATO defense 
ministerial, I proposed a civilian-military 
planning cell for Regional Command South 
to bring unity to our efforts in that critically 
important part of the country. And I 
asked Kai Eide, when I met with him last 
week, to appoint a representative to participate 
in this cell. 

Repeating an Afghanistan or an Iraq— 
forced regime change followed by nation-
building under fire—probably is unlikely in 
the foreseeable future. What is likely 
though, even a certainty, is the need to work 
with and through local governments to avoid 
the next insurgency, to rescue the next failing 
state, or to head off the next humanitarian 
disaster. 

Correspondingly, the overall posture and 
thinking of the United States armed forces 
has shifted—away from solely focusing on direct 
American military action, and towards 
new capabilities to shape the security environment 
in ways that obviate the need for 
military intervention in the future. This approach 
forms the basis of our near-term 
planning and influences the way we develop 
capabilities for the future. This perspective 
also informed the creation of Africa Command, 
with its unique interagency structure, 
a deputy commander who is an ambassador 
not a general, as well as Southern Command’s 
new orientation and priorities in 
Latin America. 

Overall, even outside Iraq and Afghanistan, 
the United States military has become more 
involved in a range of activities that in the 
past were perceived to be the exclusive province 
of civilian agencies and organizations. 
This has led to concern among many organizations—
perhaps including many represented 
here tonight—about what’s seen as a creeping 
‘‘militarization’’ of some aspects of 
America’s foreign policy. 

This is not an entirely unreasonable sentiment. 
As a career CIA officer I watched with 
some dismay the increasing dominance of 
the defense 800 pound gorilla in the intelligence 
arena over the years. But that scenario 
can be avoided if—as is the case with 
the intelligence community today—there is 
the right leadership, adequate funding of civilian 
agencies, effective coordination on the 
ground, and a clear understanding of the authorities, 
roles, and understandings of military 
versus civilian efforts, and how they fit, 
or in some cases don’t fit, together. 

We know that at least in the early phases 
of any conflict, contingency, or natural disaster, 
the U.S. military—as has been the 
case throughout our history—will be responsible 
for security, reconstruction, and providing 
basic sustenance and public services. I 
make it a point to reinforce this message before 
military audiences, to ensure that the 
lessons learned and re-learned in recent 
years are not forgotten or again pushed to 
the margins. Building the security capacity 
of other nations through training and equipping 
programs has emerged as a core and enduring 
military requirement, though none of 
these programs go forward without the approval 
of the Secretary of State. 

In recent years the lines separating war, 
peace, diplomacy, and development have become 
more blurred, and no longer fit the 
neat organizational charts of the 20th century. 
All the various elements and stakeholders 
working in the international arena— 
military and civilian, government and private—
have learned to stretch outside their 
comfort zone to work together and achieve 
results. 

For example, many humanitarian and 
international organizations have long prided 
themselves on not taking sides and avoiding 
any association with the military. But as 
we’ve seen in the vicious attacks on Doctors 
Without Borders in Afghanistan, and the 

U.N. Mission in Iraq, violent extremists care 
little about these distinctions. 
To provide clearer rules of the road for our 
efforts, the Defense Department and ‘‘InterAction’’—
the umbrella organization for 
many U.S.-based NGOs—have, for the first 
time, jointly developed guidelines for how 
the military and NGOs should relate to one 
another in a hostile environment. The Pentagon 
has also refined its guidance for humanitarian 
assistance to ensure that military 
projects are aligned with wider U.S. foreign 
policy objectives and do not duplicate 
or replace the work of civilian organizations. 

Broadly speaking, when it comes to America’s 
engagement with the rest of the world, 
you probably don’t hear this often from a 

Secretary of Defense, it is important that 
the military is—and is clearly seen to be—in 
a supporting role to civilian agencies. Our 
diplomatic leaders—be they in ambassadors’ 
suites or on the seventh floor of the State 
Department—must have the resources and 
political support needed to fully exercise 
their statutory responsibilities in leading 
American foreign policy. 

The challenge facing our institutions is to 
adapt to new realities while preserving those 
core competencies and institutional traits 
that have made them so successful in the 
past. The Foreign Service is not the Foreign 
Legion, and the United States military 
should never be mistaken for the Peace 
Corps with guns. We will always need professional 
Foreign Service officers to conduct diplomacy 
in all its dimensions, to master 
local customs and culture, to negotiate treaties, 
and advance American interests and 
strengthen our international partnerships. 
And unless the fundamental nature of humankind 
and of nations radically changes, 
the need—and will to use—the full range of 
military capabilities to deter, and if necessary 
defeat, aggression from hostile states 
and forces will remain. 

In closing, I am convinced, irrespective of 
what is reported in global opinion surveys, 
or recounted in the latest speculation about 
American decline, that around the world, 
men and women seeking freedom from despotism, 
want, and fear will continue to look 
to the United States for leadership. 

As a nation, we have, over the last two 
centuries, made our share of mistakes. From 
time to time, we have strayed from our values; 
on occasion, we have become arrogant in 
our dealings with other countries. But we 
have always corrected our course. And that 
is why today, as throughout our history, this 
country remains the world’s most powerful 
force for good—the ultimate protector of 
what Vaclav Havel once called ‘‘civilization’s 
thin veneer.’’ A nation Abraham Lincoln 
described as mankind’s ‘‘last, best 
hope.’’ 

For any given cause or crisis, if America 
does not lead, then more often than not, 
what needs to be done simply won’t get done. 
In the final analysis, our global responsibilities 
are not a burden on the people or on the 
soul of this nation. They are, rather, a blessing. 


Thank you for this award and I salute you 
for all that you do—for America, and for humanity.

LEAD-SAFE HOUSING FOR KIDS 
ACT 

SPEECH OF 

HON. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, July 29, 2008 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6309 
the ‘‘Lead Safe Housing for Kids Act’’. First, I 
would like to thank my distinguished colleague, 
KEITH ELLISON of Minnesota, for introducing 
this important legislation. This bill will 
amend the ‘‘Residential Lead-Based Paint 
Hazard Reduction Act of 1992’’ by setting the 
environmental intervention level for lead to 10 
micrograms per deciliter. Its purpose is to 
enact stricter provisions concerning the hazards 
resulting from lead-based paint in households. 
I strongly encourage my colleagues to 
support this act. 

The ‘‘Lead-Safe Housing for Kids Act’’ is important 
because of its potential to ensure 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1655 

greater protection for children. Children are 
most at risk of suffering from the toxicity of 
lead paint. Lead is a dangerous substance, 
especially so for children under the age of six, 
who are only beginning the process of developing 
their bodies and brains. Lead paint can 
cause nervous system damage, loss of hearing, 
stunted growth, severe kidney damage, 
and can even disrupt the development of the 
brain and the faculty of cognition. 

Lead-contaminated household dust, resulting 
from lead paint is the primary cause of 
lead poisoning in children throughout the 
United States. Though the number of children 
in the United States with dangerous levels of 
lead has dropped from 13.5 million in 1978, 
roughly 300,000 children still have unsafe 
blood lead levels that are in excess of 10 
micrograms per deciliter. 300 thousand, a 
number equaling half of the population of 
Texas District 18, are currently at a distinct 
risk of suffering from lead poisoning. Indeed, 
this is a major problem. 

Of the $43.4 billion spent in the United 
States annually on pediatric environmental disease, 
a great majority goes to combating and 
treating childhood lead poisoning. It is because 
of this that we must act now in putting 
forth more stringent testing requirements to 
combat the grave danger posed by lead paint. 

Upon enactment of the act, the HUD will 
have 90 days to comply with the new environmental 
intervention blood lead level of at or 
above 10 micrograms of per deciliter, the point 
at which the CDC has found cause for concern. 
This bill will save countless children from 
suffering from the myriad ailments that come 
hand in hand with lead paint. 

The tragedies of these children and others 
have exposed the fundamental problem which 
this bill addresses. For too long there has 
been no clear federally mandated standard to 
indicate excess blood lead levels in households, 
or to require action. This bill will go far 
to ensure that the children of our Nation are 
able to enjoy good health, by making certain 
that all houses become lead safe. 

Recently I amended H.R. 2352, the ‘‘School 
Safety Enhancement Act of 2007’’, which 
sought to enhance the safety of our elementary 
schools, secondary schools, and institutions 
of higher learning, by increasing the 
amount of money available for school safety. 
It is critical especially that we make funds 
available for poor communities, and specifically 
to require the creation of a tip hotline for 
school officials, parents, and students, to report 
the existence of hazards and chemicals. 
I also provided amendments that would require 
institutions to create a safety plan, dealing 
with potential terror, chemical, or otherwise 
hazardous situations. These concerns for the 
safety of children in schools are similar to 
those concerns that I have for the wellbeing of 
children in their homes. In both situations, I 
believe children should be free from the dangers 
presented by hazardous materials and 
situations, including the threat of lead paint. 

As the safety of children should be critical to 
all Americans, I urge my colleagues to support 
this act to protect our Nation’s children and 
our Nation’s future from harm’s way. 

EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE 
UNITED NATIONS AFRICAN 
UNION MISSION IN DARFUR 
(UNAMID) 

SPEECH OF 

HON. LYNN C. WOOLSEY 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H. Res. 1351. This resolution expresses 
the support for the United Nations African 
Union Mission in Darfur. It also calls 
upon United Nation Member States and the 
international community to contribute the resources 
necessary to ensure the success of 
the mission. 

On July 8, 2008, seven U.N. peacekeepers 
were killed and an additional 22 were wounded 
while serving on the mission to bring peace 
and stability to the Darfur region of Sudan. 
This is only the latest in series of attacks on 
the peacekeepers. The severe lack of troops, 
police officers, and air transport limits the mission’s 
effectiveness. 

Despite the deployment of 26,000 peace-
keepers, their efforts are constantly thwarted 
by the Sudanese government and rebels. 
Clearly, the success of the mission depends 
on additional contributions of U.N. Member 
Nations and the international community. 
Therefore, I ask Congress to condemn the attacks 
on the U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur and 
I ask that the Sudanese government ensure 
that those responsible are brought to justice. 

We express our full commitment to the people 
of Darfur and call on all members of the 
international community to contribute the resources 
necessary to ensure the success of 
the United Nations African Union Mission in 
Darfur. We cannot in good conscience turn 
away from this troubled region. It deserves our 
full support and attention to bring a halt to the 
atrocities committed in this area of the world.

TRIBUTE TO NICK DONOFRIO 

HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 

OF CONNECTICUT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is my 
great pleasure to pay special tribute to Connecticut 
resident Mr. Nick Donofrio who is retiring 
after more than 40 years in various leadership 
capacities at the IBM Corporation. 

Nick joined IBM in 1967 and spent the early 
part of his career in integrated circuit and chip 
development, as a designer of logic and memory 
chips. He held numerous technical management 
positions and, later, executive positions 
in several of IBM’s product divisions. He 
has led many of IBM’s major development and 
manufacturing teams—from semiconductor 
and storage technologies, to microprocessors 
and personal computers, to IBM’s entire family 
of servers. 

Nick has always been a champion for innovation 
across IBM and its global ecosystem. 
He has been the leader of IBM’s global technology 
strategy. In addition to his strategic 
business mission, Nick has led the development 
and retention of IBM’s technical population 
and strives to enrich that community 
with a diversity of culture and thought. 

Nick has been focused sharply on advancing 
education, employment and career opportunities 
for underrepresented minorities and 
women—all issues of great importance to me 
as well. 

He served for many years on the Board of 
Directors for the National Action Council for 
Minorities in Engineering (NACME). He has 
served on the Board of Directors for INROADS, 
a non-profit organization focused on 
the training and development of talented minority 
youth for professional careers in business 
and industry, and he is co-chair of the 
New York Hall of Science. A fellow Italian-
American, Nick was awarded the prestigious 
2007 National Education and Leadership 
Award from the Sons of Italy Foundation. 

He is the holder of seven technology patents 
and is a member of numerous technical 
and science honor societies. In 2002, Nick 
was recognized by Europe’s Institution of 
Electrical Engineers with the Mensforth International 
Gold Medal for outstanding contributions 
to the advancement of manufacturing engineering. 
In 2003, he was named Industry 
Week magazine’s Technology Leader of the 
Year, the University of Arizona’s Technical Executive 
of the Year, and was presented with 
the Rodney D. Chipp Memorial Award by the 
Society of Women Engineers for his outstanding 
contributions to the advancement of 
women in the engineering field. In 2005, Nick 
was elected a member of the American Academy 
of Arts and Sciences, he was presented 
with Syracuse University’s highest alumni 
honor—the George Arents Pioneer Medal, and 
he was honored by CNBC with its Overall 
Technology Leadership Award. 

Madam Speaker, please join me in congratulating 
Nick Donofrio as he begins a new, 
exciting chapter in his life.

TELL CITY SESQUICENTENNIAL 
CELEBRATION 

HON. BARON P. HILL 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, 2008 marks the 
150th anniversary of the founding of Tell City, 
in Perry County, Indiana. Nestled on the Ohio 
River and surrounded by the natural beauty of 
the Hoosier National Forest, the city’s 7,500 
citizens personify a warm and welcoming demeanor 
and help define the term ‘‘Hoosier 
Hospitality.’’ 

The Town’s ceremonial observance of this 
anniversary will be held beginning Saturday, 
August 2nd continuing through August 9th, 
2008. Organized to coincide with the city’s annual 
Schweizerfest, itself a Hoosier treasure 
developed in 1959 after the city’s centennial 
celebration, a number of celebratory events 
have been planned including musical performances, 
historical tours, steamboat river 
cruises, a city picnic, as well as a parade and 
trolley tours. I look forward to celebrating Tell 
City’s Sesquicentennial with its residents and 
attending some of these events during the festival. 


The history of Tell City is richly accentuated 
by the story of European immigrants that 
came to our country during the 19th Century. 
The story begins not in Indiana but in neighboring 
Cincinnati, Ohio. Cincinnati was a 


E1656 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

major departure point for German immigrants 
hoping to settle further west, and in 1856 a 
group of investors paid $15.00 per share to 
found the Swiss Colonization Society. Their 
desire was to locate and purchase land for a 
new community—and their search was exhaustive. 
The search included potential sites 
as far west as the Nebraska and Kansas prairie. 
The members of the Swiss Colonization 
Society finally agreed upon a 4,100 acre site 
between the Town of Troy and the City of 
Cannelton in Perry County, Indiana. 

They created the new city from scratch, laying 
out more than 7,300 lots along wide 
streets named after leaders in science, education 
and the arts. The first 620 settlers arrived 
in May 1858 and within weeks more than 
eighty homes were either constructed or being 
built. 

The first name proposed for the city was 
‘‘Helvetia’’ after the early Latin name for Switzerland. 
However, out of a desire to fit the 
new country they had come to settle, they reconsidered 
and instead chose to honor their 
Swiss heritage by naming the city after William 
Tell, the legendary 14th century Swiss freedom 
fighter well-known for sparking the rebellion 
against the Hapsburg Emperors that led to 
the formation of the Swiss Confederation, a 
precursor to the modern day Switzerland. 

The immigrants that settled in Tell City desired 
a community founded on the principles 
of free enterprise, hard work, and freedom. 
The community’s founding mothers and fathers 
spoke mostly German and were born in 
Swiss cantons or the yet-to-be-unified Germany. 


These settlers left behind political tensions 
and the economic perils of Europe for the 
promise offered in America. 

Quickly developing sources of trade and 
commerce, these industrious men and women 
offered their fellow citizens the staples of the 
day through the milling of grain, brick making, 
and the production of clothing, food and beer. 
One of the earliest trades established in Tell 
City was that of woodworking and furniture 
building. That tradition continues today 
through businesses such as Tell City Chair, 
William Tell Woodworkers/Swiss Plywood, and 
Castlewood Corporation. 

As Tell City grew, other industries and services 
also came to the emerging community, including 
attorneys, the first postmaster and a 
fire-fighting company. The first school was 
constructed in 1859 in a small, two story 
school house. While the lower level was used 
for teaching, the upstairs room was used as 
living space for the school’s teacher. 

Faith also played an important role in the 
growing community and remains a key component. 
The first church was a catholic church, 
built in the 1000 block of Main Street. While 
the original structure has long since been 
razed, St. Paul’s Catholic Church continues 
that legacy and has been joined by ten other 
denominations throughout the city. 

The Swiss Colonization Society continued to 
direct the city’s development through its early 
years and functioned in large part as a municipal 
government until the new city could function 
independently. Over the course of its last 
several years, the Society deeded the remaining 
land not settled to the city and the community 
schools and on April 17, 1879 disbanded. 

It wasn’t until 1886, however, that the town 
elected August Schreiber as its first mayor. A 
native of Prussia, Schreiber came to America 

in 1855 and entered the pharmacy business, 
founding Schreiber’s Drug Store in Tell City. 
His term as Mayor lasted only two years. It 
wasn’t until 1892 when Albert Fenn was elected 
to the position that a native born in Tell 
City became mayor. Fenn held many other 
public offices, including that of county auditor, 
city clerk, and city councilman. Fenn also 
played an important role in politics outside of 
Tell City, serving as a delegate in 1896 and as 
a sergeant-at-arms from 1900–1912 at the 
Democratic national conventions. 

One of Albert Fenn’s greatest legacies to 
Tell City is the City Hall. Conceived in 1895 by 
Fenn and others to lure the county seat to Tell 
City from neighboring Cannelton, the original 
intent was to construct the structure and then 
donate it to the County. This action set off a 
competition with the residents of Cannelton, 
who also began work to raise funds and construct 
a new structure for the county. 

Cannelton completed its project first and 
provided the structure to the county without 
cost or the legal process of relocating the 
county seat. Tell City retained its building as 
the city hall, using the extra space in the 
structure for a myriad of civic and community 
functions, including use as school space. In 
what is perhaps the most ironic and controversial 
footnote to the story, Perry County did relocate 
its county seat to Tell City in 1994 to a 
new structure located on Payne Street. 

Tell City played an important role for shipping 
during the 1880’s. Early commerce and 
travel was easier along the Ohio River than 
via the rough roads that connected the city 
with other communities such as Paoli and Jasper, 
Indiana. As a result, Tell City developed 
one of the largest ports between Louisville, KY 
and Evansville, IN and in 1889, the Louisville 
and Evansville Mail line named a new boat 
Tell City in honor of the city’s importance on 
the route. Comprising nearly 38 acres, the Tell 
City River Port continues the city’s river heritage, 
specializing in the handling of bulk materials 
such as pig iron, coke, coal and 
woodchips for area manufacturers. 

The river has also served to challenge the 
community. A victim of the 1937 Ohio River 
Flood, much of the community had to be restored 
or rebuilt. Ohio River Flood Markers are 
painted on the William Tell Woodcrafters Office 
Building on Seventh Street depicting the 
actual levels of the water during this and other 
floods. As with other communities following 
that historic flood, the Army Corps of Engineers 
constructed a flood wall to protect the 
citizenry from future flooding. 

Tell City stands as Perry County’s largest 
community and serves as the largest economic 
district in the county. To that end, the 
City recently completed a renovation of its 
downtown district with new landscaping, street 
lights, and bike racks. Bike lanes were also 
added throughout the four-block district. 

An extensive network of recreational facilities 
has also been developed in the community 
to provide assorted athletic opportunities 
to the residents of the community. New walking 
trails and further developments of these facilities 
demonstrate the pride and dedication 
enjoyed by this community. 

Above all else, the real treasure of Tell City 
is it citizens. Despite any challenges they may 
face, they continue to display a collective confidence 
and ingenuity that overcomes any 
problem and has allowed the city to flourish. 

It is an honor and privilege to represent this 
community in Congress. I want to congratulate 

Tell City on its Sesquicentennial, and look forward 
to seeing how this unique and wonderful 
city thrives for decades to come.

TRIBUTE TO LEADERS OF THE 
ENERGY EFFICIENCY CAUCUS 

HON. JOE COURTNEY 

OF CONNECTICUT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend the leaders of the Energy 
Efficiency Caucus, Representatives MARK 
UDALL and ZACH WAMP, for spearheading the 
Congressional Renewable Energy and Energy 
Efficiency Expo. More than 50 businesses 
from around the country will demonstrate their 
sustainable energy technologies. 

Energy efficiency must be the cornerstone 
of our energy policy because it affords our 
country the ability to decrease demand for oil 
and other energy sources, thus reducing our 
overall energy consumption and increasing our 
national security. Congress must enact incentives 
to make sure that these technologies 
flourish. 

As I travel across Connecticut’s Second 
Congressional District, I have seen first-hand 
the innovation that businesses, school districts 
and families are employing to reduce their energy 
costs and reduce energy emissions. 

Earlier this week, I attended a House field 
hearing in Hartford, Connecticut, at which the 
leaders of General Electric and United Technologies 
Corporation, both headquartered in 
Connecticut, discussed their energy efficient 
technologies. These two companies, like the 
ones exhibiting at the EXPO, have developed 
a variety of products for all sectors of the 
economy. At the same time, these companies 
are also seeing their own energy consumption 
and costs lowered as they embrace energy efficient 
technologies internally. 

I encourage my colleagues to stop by the 
EXPO in the Cannon Caucus Room on Thursday 
anytime between 9 a.m.–5 p.m. It is an 
opportunity to see innovation first-hand.

IN HONOR OF RICHLAND TOWNSHIP’S 
175TH ANNIVERSARY AND 
THE FIRST ANNUAL RICHLAND 
COMMUNITY DAYS 

HON. JOHN P. MURTHA 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. MURTHA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to acknowledge Richland Township in 
Cambria County, Pennsylvania, as it celebrates 
its 175th Anniversary and to commend 
the township on its first annual Richland Community 
Days. 

Madam Speaker, Richland’s history dates 
back to the second half of the 18th Century 
when the area was still part of Bedford County. 
Some of the area’s earliest settlers were 
the Adams family, which included Samuel, Rachel, 
and Solomon. Their legacy lives on 
through the various landmarks in the area that 
were named after the members of the family. 
Richland Township was officially formed in 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1657 

1833 out of land from Conemaugh Township 
in the new Cambria County. The township was 
given the name of ‘‘Richland’’ because of the 
quality of its land. 

Over the last 175 years, Richland Township 
has seen tremendous growth, and, in the last 
2 decades in particular, has transformed itself 
into a hub of commercial, educational, retail, 
and high-tech opportunities. I’m proud of these 
accomplishments and I look forward to working 
to ensure continued growth and a brighter 
future for both Richland and our region. 

The Richland Community Days are an extraordinary 
way for the citizens of Richland to 
recognize their township’s history as well as to 
look forward to its future. Madam Speaker, I 
finish my remarks by congratulating Richland 
Township on its 175th Anniversary and to recognize 
the many volunteers who have worked 
hard to make the first annual Richland Community 
Days a success.

PROVIDING FOR PATENT AND 

TRADEMARK JUDICIAL APPOINT


MENTS 

SPEECH OF 

HON. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, July 29, 2008 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of S. 3295, to amend 
title 35, United States Code, and the Trademark 
Act of 1946 to provide that the Secretary 
of Commerce, in consultation with the Director 
of the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office, shall appoint administrative patent 
judges and administrative trademark judges. 

S. 3295 amends both the Patent Act and 
Lanham Act with regard to administrative 
judge appointments. I support the bill and I encourage 
my colleagues to do likewise. 
S. 3295 proposes that the Secretary of 
Commerce, in consultation with the PTO Director, 
appoint administrative patent judges 
and administrative trademark judges. H.R. 
6362 also states that the Secretary of Commerce 
may deem the appointment of an administrative 
patent judge or administrative 
trademark judge who previously held office 
pursuant to an appointment by the PTO Director 
to have taken effect on the date when the 
administrative patent judge or administrative 
trade judge was originally appointed by the 
PTO Director. Additionally, the bill creates a 
defense to a constitutional challenge of an administrative 
patent judge or administrative 
trademark judge appointment, declaring that 
the administrative patent judge or administrative 
trademark judge was acting as a de facto 
officer after being appointed by the PTO Director. 
Before March 2000, administrative patent 
judges were appointed by the Secretary of 
Commerce. In November 1999, new legislation 
gave the appointment power to the director 
of the PTO. That legislation took effect on 
March 29, 2000. Since then 47 of the 74 administrative 
patent judges currently serving on 
the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences 
were appointed by the director of PTO. 

S. 3295 is necessary because it creates a 
defense to constitutional challenge of an administrative 
patent judge or administrative 
trademark judge’s appointment. This bill was 
introduced in response to several challenges. 
In those challenges, parties are contesting 
the validity of the Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences decisions based upon the alleged 
unconstitutionality of the appointment of 
certain administrative patent judges who participated 
in those decisions. The challengers 
argue that the director of the PTO does not 
have the power of appointment under Article 2 
of the Constitution. If courts hold these appointments 
unconstitutional, the effects could 
be widespread, affecting potentially thousands 
of patents and patent applications. This situation 
alone would lead to a greater patent backlog. 
The PTO already faces what seems to be 
an insurmountable patent backlog. 

Specifically, this challenge creates arguments 
for patent applicants whose patent application 
rejections were affirmed by the Board 
of Patent Appeals and Interferences, as well 
as a potential defense for patent litigants 
where the patent in suit resulted from the 
Board’s overturning an examiner’s final rejection. 
S. 3295 is necessary to preserve the integrity 
of the administrative patent judge and 
administrative trademark judge appointment 
system. 

I support this Act and encourage my colleagues 
to support it also.

INTRODUCTION OF THE COMPENSATION 
AND RESPECT FOR 
ENERGY WORKERS ACT ‘‘CARE 
ACT’’ 

HON. MARK UDALL 

OF COLORADO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, 
today I am introducing a bill to improve the 
workings of the Energy Employees Occupational 
Illness Compensation Program Act 
(EEOICPA). 

The bill, cosponsored by my Colorado colleague, 
Mr. Perlmutter, is entitled the Compensation 
and Respect for Energy Workers 
Act ( or ‘‘CARE Act’’). 

It is similar to legislation with that title introduced 
in the Senate by Senator SALAZAR, but 
unlike the Senate version it also includes a 
section that would amend the EEOICPA to expand 
the number of former workers at the 
Rocky Flats site in Colorado covered by the 
‘‘special exposure cohort’’ provisions of that 
law. This part of the new bill is identical to 
section 3 of H.R. 904, which I introduced with 
Mr. PERLMUTTER last year. 

The Energy Employees Occupational Illness 
Program Act (EEOICPA) was enacted to compensate 
American workers (and certain survivors) 
who put their health and life on the line 
to serve our Nation during the Cold War. 
Among them were thousands of Coloradans 
who worked at Rocky Flats as well as some 
other sites covered by the EEOICPA law. 
Many of them developed beryllium disease, 
cancer, or other ailments from being exposed 
to beryllium, radiation, or other hazards. 

When I was first elected to Congress, I 
began working with colleagues in the House 
and Senate—on both sides of the aisle—to 
provide a measure of justice for them and 
those with similar problems who worked at 
other nuclear-weapons sites. 

Before the Clinton Administration, the federal 
government had resisted paying claims 

filed by injured workers. But, led by Bill Richardson 
as Secretary of Energy, the Clinton 
Administration took a different position and 
asked Congress to establish a compensation 
program. 

That prompted me and other Members to introduce 
legislation to accomplish that objective. 
And I was among those who strongly 
supported the EEOICPA provisions that were 
finally enacted into law in 2000. 

But the next year brought a new Administration 
that, regrettably, has not been as strong 
an advocate of the program as its predecessor. 
In fact, after the Bush Administration 
inherited this program, they have both mismanaged 
it and tried to undermine it. They 
seemed not to realize that this is not just 
about money, but about the honor of the 
United States. 

With other supporters of the program, I have 
worked to get the Administration to improve its 
implementation—and I will continue to do so. 

But I also have worked to correct problems 
with the EEOICPA law itself—and the bill I am 
introducing today is part of that ongoing effort. 

While many people have received benefits 
under the Program, too many face incredible 
obstacles as they try to demonstrate that they 
qualify. More than 8 years after enactment, 
workers have died without receiving the 
healthcare or compensation they deserve. In 
fact, a combination of missing records and bureaucratic 
red tape has prevented many workers 
from accessing any compensation for their 
serious illnesses. 

The CARE Act is designed to expand the 
category of individuals eligible for compensation, 
improve the procedures for providing 
compensation and transparency, and grant the 
Office of the Ombudsman greater authority to 
help workers. 

Toward that end, the first 10 sections of the 
bill would: 

Expand the list of cancers for which individuals 
are eligible to receive compensation—this 
would be done by amending the relevant part 
of another law, the Radiation Exposures Compensation 
Act (RECA) because EEOICPA 
adopts that law’s list by reference. 

Require the Department of Labor (DOL) to 
pay a claimant’s estate should a claimant die 
after filing their claim but before receiving payment 
and leave no survivors. 

Expand the duties of the Office of the 
EEOICPA Ombudsman to include the ability to 
provide information to claimants on benefits 
available under Part B. 

Grant the Ombudsman the authority to contract 
for expert services to assist in the execution 
of its duties (e.g., individuals with expertise 
in health physics, medicine and toxicology). 


Require DOL to provide the public with access 
to the ‘‘site exposure matrix’’ and any 
other databases or site profiles used to evaluate 
claims for compensation. 

Expand the statute of limitations to 1 year to 
provide ample time for workers whose claims 
have been denied to file a petition in federal 
court. 

Require any federal agency with jurisdiction 
over the program to provide information to 
claimants in easily understandable language 
and, if a claim is denied, provide claimants 
with a detailed, written explanation of all reasons 
for the denial and the additional documents, 
evidence, or information necessary to 
meet the burden of proof on appeal. 


E1658 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

Require the Office the Office of Workers’ 
Compensation Programs to directly pay service 
providers for personal care services and 
transportation to assist low-income claimants 
who cannot afford to cover the cost of necessary 
medical and transportation expenses 
and wait for reimbursement from the government. 


Require claims examiners to provide written 
notice to claimants who file under either Part 
B or Part E of potential monetary or medical 
compensation for which they may be eligible. 

Require DOL to provide a list of physicians 
qualified to perform medical and impairment 
screenings from independent medical associations 
and institutions of higher education. 

Prohibit the Departments of Energy (DOE) 
and Labor from destroying original documents 
related to any DOE facility that might reasonably 
be expected to be used by workers in 
support of filing claims under EEOICPA. 

And, section 11 of the bill would revise the 
part of the EEOICPA law that specifies which 
covered workers are part of what the law designates 
as the ‘‘Special Exposure Cohort.’’ 

The revision would extend this ‘‘special exposure 
cohort’’ status to Department of Energy 
employees, Department of Energy contractor 
employees, or atomic weapons employees— 
all terms defined by the current law—who 
worked at the Rocky Flats site, in Colorado, 
for at least 250 days prior to January 1, 2006. 

The result would be to help provide the 
Act’s benefits to any of those workers who 
contracted a radiation-linked cancer specified 
in the Act after beginning employment at 
Rocky Flats. 

As the law now stands, before a Rocky 
Flats worker suffering from a covered cancer 
can receive benefits, it must be established 
that the cancer is as likely as not to have resulted 
from on-the-job exposure to radiation. 
That sounds like a reasonable requirement 
and it would be appropriate for Rocky Flats if 
we had adequate documentation of radiation 
exposures for the years when it was producing 
nuclear-weapons components as well as for 
the more recent time when DOE and its contractors 
have been working to clean it up and 
prepare it for closure. 

However, in fact there were serious shortcomings 
in the monitoring of Rocky Flats 
workers’ radiation exposures and in the necessary 
recordkeeping—to say nothing of the 
slowness of the current administrative process 
for making the required determinations concerning 
links between exposure and employment. 


So there is a risk that a significant number 
of Rocky Flats workers who should be able to 
benefit from the Act will not obtain its benefits 
in a timely manner or will be denied them entirely. 


The bill would prevent this miscarriage of 
justice, by recognizing that Rocky Flats workers 
have been plagued by the same kinds of 
administrative problems that entangled workers 
at some other locations—administrative 
problems that were addressed through inclusion 
in the Act of the provisions related to the 
‘‘Special Exposure Cohort.’’ 

My understating of the need for this bill 
came from meeting with Rocky Flats workers 
and their representatives and by consulting 
experts. I have particularly benefited from the 
great experience and expertise of Dr. Robert 
Bistline. Dr. Bistline has served as Program 
Manager of the Energy Department’s Over


sight of Radiation Protection Program at the 
Rocky Flats field office and has few if any 
peers in terms of his understanding of the 
problems addressed by the bill. In particular, 
the bill reflects these aspects of Rocky Flats 
history: 

Many worker exposures were unmonitored 
over the plant’s history. For some estimated 
doses were assigned, and radiation exposures 
for many others are missing. As a result, there 
are at best incomplete records and many inaccuracies 
in the exposure records that do exist. 

No lung counter for detecting and measuring 
plutonium and americium in the lungs 
existed at Rocky Flats until the late 1960’s. 
Without this equipment the very insoluble 
oxide forms of plutonium cannot be detected 
and a large number of workers had inhalation 
exposures that went undetected and 
unmeasured. 

Exposure to neutron radiation was not monitored 
until the late 1950’s and most of those 
measurements through 1970 have been found 
to be in error. In some areas of the plant the 
neutron doses were as much as 2 to 10 times 
as great as the gamma doses received by 
workers but only gamma doses were recorded. 


As a result of these and other shortcomings, 
some Rocky Flats workers have been denied 
compensation under the Act despite having 
worked with tons of plutonium and having 
known exposures leading to serious health effects. 


Madam Speaker, since early in my tenure in 
Congress I have worked to make good on 
promises of a fairer deal for the nuclear-weapons 
workers who helped America win the Cold 
War. That was why enactment and improvement 
of the compensation Act has been one 
of my top priorities. I saw this as a very important 
matter for our country—and especially for 
many Coloradans because our State is home 
to the Rocky Flats site, which for decades was 
a key part of the nuclear-weapons complex. 

Now the site’s military mission has ended 
and the last of the Rocky Flats workers have 
completed the job of cleaning it up for closure. 
And just as they worked to take care of the 
site, we in Congress need to take care of 
them and the others who worked there in the 
past, and do a better job of taking care of 
those who have worked at other sites as well. 

That was the purpose of the compensation 
act. I am very proud that I was able to help 
achieve its enactment, but I am also aware 
that it is not perfect. The bill being introduced 
today will not remedy all the shortcomings of 
the current law, but it will make it better.

A TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF 
SIDNEY HARVEY CRAIG 

HON. JIM COSTA 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to the life of a special man, Sidney 
Harvey Craig of Santa Fe, California, who recently 
passed away at the age of 76 years 
old. He leaves behind his loving wife Jenny, 5 
children and 13 grandchildren. 

Mr. Craig, affectionately known as Sid, was 
born on March 22, 1932 in Vancouver, British 
Columbia and was raised in Alhambra, Cali


fornia. After attending Mt. San Antonio College, 
Mr. Craig transferred to Fresno State 
College and graduated with a major in business 
and psychology. While at Fresno State 
he taught dance classes at the Arthur Murray 
dance studio. Upon graduating from Fresno 
State he joined the Arthur Murray dance studio 
and before long owned several franchises 
and served on its board of directors. 

At the age of 22 years old he was stationed 
in San Diego serving in the U.S. Navy. During 
the same time he became friends with Hal 
King, who introduced him to horseracing. King 
would later become Sid’s business partner, 
trainer and racing manager until he died in 
1991. Sid’s love for horses led to him owning 
a number of successful thoroughbreds. In 
1995 Sid and his wife Jenny purchased a 237-
acre thoroughbred horse-racing stable in Rancho 
Santa Fe. Several of their thoroughbreds 
raced in the Belmont Stakes and the Kentucky 
Derby, and one set a Del Mar track record for 
11/4 mile. 

After moving to Australia with his wife Jenny 
in 1982 they started Jenny Craig International, 
the successful weight-loss program which 
went public on the New York Stock Exchange 
after only two years. At the height of their careers, 
Sid and Jenny oversaw more than 650 
Jenny Craig centers in the United States, Canada, 
Australia and New Zealand. Twenty-three 
years and 4 million dieters later, they eventually 
sold the Jenny Craig centers to Nestle. 

In 1992 Mr. Craig returned to his alma 
mater and made a significant donation to the 
Fresno State School of Business, which was 
renamed in his honor to the Sid Craig School 
of Business. In 1993, Fresno State President 
John Welty also gave him an honorary degree 
of doctorate for his contributions to the university, 
his commitment to others and its students. 
And to this day, the community of Fresno 
credits Sid and Jenny Craig’s generosity 
for helping the Sid Craig School of Business 
become one of the top 100 business schools 
in the country. Mr. Craig was known for his 
philanthropist style with business, his generosity 
and for his passion for horseracing. 

Sid Craig will be remembered by many for 
his success in business, his generous philanthropy, 
and for his passion for horseracing. I 
am honored and humbled to join his family in 
celebrating the life of this amazing man. His 
presence will be missed in our community and 
by many others whose lives he so graciously 
touched.

TRIBUTE TO LOUISE L. FRANCESCONI 
ON HER RETIREMENT 

HON. GABRIELLE GIFFORDS 

OF ARIZONA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Ms. GIFFORDS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute and great respect to Louise 
L. Francesconi, as she retires after 33 
years of service to our great Nation as the 
President of Raytheon Missile Systems in Tucson, 
Arizona. 

Ms. Francesconi is retiring from this position 
after leading the world’s largest missile company, 
with sales of $5B and nearly 13,000 employees, 
which for years has helped guarantee 
our Nation’s security and interests worldwide. 
Her systems have been employed to protect 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1659 

the lives of hundreds of thousands of soldiers, 
sailors, airmen and Marines around the world. 

Louise began her remarkable career in 1975 
in Canoga Park, CA, as a financial analyst 
with Hughes Missile Systems Company. In 
fact, she comes from a family of ‘‘missileers.’’ 
Louise credits her father, Leo Langlois, an engineer 
with Hughes, for getting her into the 
business right after her graduation from 
Scripps College in Claremont, CA. 

After joining Hughes, Louise began her meteoric 
rise through the company. Louise quickly 
became known and had the well-deserved 
reputation of being able to not only structure 
a win-win business deal, but also help the organization 
think through complex issues and 
challenges. 

In 1993 and the years that followed, she became 
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 
Chief Operating Officer, President of 
Hughes Missile Systems Company and eventually, 
after the Hughes merger with Raytheon, 
President of Raytheon Missile Systems. 
Throughout her career, Louise has been 
known as an inspiring mentor, teacher and 
role model to all. Her mastery of business 
strategy enabled the Missile Company to grow 
over 100 percent in sales over the last 6 years 
rising to become southern Arizona’s number 
one employer. Louise’s dedication to the U.S. 
warfighter and our allies and friends around 
the world is legendary. From the Tomahawk 
Cruise Missile to the complex Missile Defense 
Systems that guard our homeland, she has 
provided for the collective defense of this 
great Nation. 

Grounded by her strong love of family, to include 
her husband John, their children, her 
parents, in-laws and brother and sister, she 
has continued to provide strength and inspiration 
to her Raytheon family. Her long-lasting 
legacy will be her dedication to the people of 
Raytheon and her strong core values of inclusiveness, 
personal and professional ethics and 
leadership excellence. 

I join with my colleagues on behalf of all the 
freedom loving people around the world to 
offer our heartfelt congratulations and thanks 
to a true American patriot. Louise has earned 
our respect and admiration as a champion for 
freedom and a role model for all.

APOLOGY 

HON. JOHN D. DINGELL 

OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, during floor 
debate on the legislation to regulate tobacco 
yesterday, I made some remarks that unfairly, 
and inaccurately, personalized the issue, and 
I am here today to apologize to my friend and 
colleague JOHN BOEHNER. 

I have the utmost respect for his professional 
abilities, as well as great affection for 
him personally. I did not intend for my remarks 
to be taken in any way as personal criticism. 
As a friend, I just did not want to see anything 
bad happen to him or for his family to be burdened 
unnecessarily in any way. Those are 
matters that are distinct from any legitimate 
disagreement over matters of public policy, 
and while we have indeed had disagreements, 
we have also been able to work together on 

many matters of importance. I hope that we 
will continue to do so. 

Again, I hope Mr. BOEHNER will accept my 
apology.

TRIBUTE TO COLONEL ROBERT K. 
MORGAN 

HON. BILL SHUSTER 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the late Colonel Robert K. Morgan, 
pilot of the B–17 Memphis Belle. Colonel 
Morgan served the United States of America 
in the Army Air Corp during World War II from 
1941–1945 and the United States Air Force 
Reserve from 1945–1965. Colonel Morgan is 
being honored by the Kiwanis Club of Altoona 
on August 20, 2008, at which time his widow, 
Linda, will reflect upon the great adventures 
and accomplishments of her husband. 

Colonel Morgan was a great serviceman 
who dedicated much of his life to serving our 
country. For his service, Colonel Morgan was 
awarded the distinguished Flying Cross with 2 
Oak Leaf Clusters and the Air Medal with 10 
Oak Leaf Clusters. On May 17, 1943 Colonel 
Morgan and his crew of the Memphis Belle 
became the first to complete twenty-five missions 
over Europe and return to the United 
States. Colonel Morgan’s mission was made 
into a combat documentary, entitled ‘‘Memphis 
Belle,’’ by Warner Brothers in 1990. Following 
the historic flight over Europe, Colonel Morgan 
and his crew departed England in June 1943 
for the United States and began a thirty city 
public relations/war bond tour. Colonel Morgan’s 
crew were recognized as heroes at 
every stop on their tour and thanked by the 
American public. Morgan went on to lead the 
first B–29 bombing raid on Tokyo in 1944, 
after which he served in the Air Force Reserves 
and retired as a full Colonel in 1965. 

Colonel Morgan’s heroic service and leadership 
in the Army Air Corps during World War 
II and the United States Air Force Reserve will 
forever be remembered. His service and dedication 
brought great pride to our nation, his 
family, and his community. Colonel Morgan’s 
memory as an Army officer of the highest caliber 
will not be forgotten. His actions reflected 
great credit upon himself, his flight crew, and 
the United States Army. I would like to stand 
with the Kiwanis Club of Altoona to recognize 
the late Colonel Robert K. Morgan for all of his 
leadership and devotion to the United States 
of America. 

Colonel Robert K. Morgan’s wife, Linda, his 
family and friends, and the Kiwanis Club of Altoona 
are certainly proud of the Colonel’s life 
of service and commitment to our country during 
a time of war both at home and abroad 
and it gives me great pleasure to honor his life 
and selfless service.

NO RECESS FOR CONGRESS 

HON. JERRY MORAN 

OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Madam Speaker, 
For years, this country has needed a national 

energy policy that increases the supply of energy, 
promotes renewable and alternative 
fuels, and encourages conservation. Kansans 
deserve action and they need it now. Instead, 
we have a Democratic Congress blaming the 
Republican President and both parties trying 
to score political points in the November election. 


After failing to convince my colleagues to 
stay and work, rather than take an August recess, 
I voted against Congress adjourning. 
Now is the time for Congress to adopt a plan 
to increase supplies and reduce demand. We 
should stay in Washington until this work is 
done. The price of gas at the pump, and the 
cost businesses and farmers face for fuel and 
fertilizer, tell me that it should not be business 
as usual in Washington, DC.

IN RECOGNITION OF ASBAREZ-AR


MENIAN DAILY NEWSPAPER’S 

100TH ANNIVERSARY 

HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 100th anniversary of the 
Asbarez-Armenian Daily Newspaper. Asbarez, 
which translates to ‘arena’ in English, was 
founded on August 14, 1908 in Fresno, California, 
by seven dedicated members of the Armenian-
American community: Aslan Aslanian, 
Bedros Hagopian, Levon Hagopian, Abraham 
Seklemian, Hovaness Kabadayan, Avedis 
Tufenkjian and Arpaxat Setrakian. 

Like its counterparts in other Diaspora communities, 
such as Hairenik in Boston and 
Aztag in Lebanon, Asbarez has chronicled the 
Armenian experience worldwide. Among other 
things, they have written about the dire conditions 
in the homeland under Imperial Russia 
and Ottoman Turkey, the calamity of the Armenian 
Genocide, the World Wars, the rise 
and fall of the first Republic, Soviet rule, the 
tragic 1988 earthquake, the Karabakh 
‘‘Artsakh’’ liberation and the independence of 
the Republic of Armenia. 

In the words of Edward Megerdichian, who 
worked at Asbarez from 1956–1963, 
‘‘[Asbarez] was ninety percent voluntary, and 
everyone had a sense of ownership, a sense 
of community—that this is our paper and our 
lives are described in this paper.’’ 

During the 1970’s Asbarez Publishing Company 
moved its operations from California’s 
San Joaquin Valley to the Los Angeles basin. 
Since its inception, the circulation of the newspaper 
has grown from 1,200 copies to thousands; 
it has become a formidable bilingual 
daily newspaper and a dependable source for 
information in the online community. 

It is my distinct honor to recognize 
Asbarez’s unwavering commitment to inform 
and educate the public. I ask my colleagues in 
the U.S. House of Representatives to join me 
in congratulating Asbarez on their 100th anniversary. 



E1660 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘‘WHATEVER 
IT TAKES TO REBUILD 
ACT OF 2008’’ 

HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Madam 
Speaker, today I am reintroducing the ‘‘Whatever 
It Takes to Rebuild Act of 2008’’. 

A disaster can leave the tax base of an affected 
community eroded, necessitating Federal 
assistance to pay for essential services. 
These essential services, including police, fire, 
and school personnel, are even more critical 
in the wake of a disaster. To aid communities, 
Congress created the Community Disaster 
Loan Program. While this program has worked 
with great success, there are two significant 
issues that need to be fixed. The first issue is 
that this assistance is delivered in the form of 
a loan and the second is that any loan is limited 
to $5 million. Providing this aid as a loan 
can further delay the recovery of a local community 
and the $5 million cap does not allow 
for adequate assistance for medium or large 
communities. 

The ‘‘Whatever It Takes to Rebuild Act’’ 
would repeal the requirement that disaster affected 
communities repay the assistance they 
receive under the Community Disaster Loan 
Program. This legislation would permanently 
repeal the $5 million cap on these loans, 
would make states eligible for this assistance, 
repeal the cap that limits loans to 25 percent 
of a municipality’s operating expenses, and 
would provide this assistance as grants when 
a disaster has been declared an ‘‘Incident of 
National Significance’’ under the National Response 
plan. All of these provisions are aimed 
at giving the federal government the tools and 
flexibility we need to fully respond following a 
disaster. 

This program was used most recently immediately 
following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. 
While it was able to provide significant 
benefits, repayment requirements have raised 
significant hurdles for many recipient communities. 
In the wake of a disaster, the government 
should give American communities the 
financial assistance they need to get back on 
their feet with no strings attached. That is why 
I am reintroducing the ‘‘Whatever It Takes to 
Rebuild Act.’’

INTRODUCTION OF TARGET PRAC


TICE AND MARKSMANSHIP 

TRAINING SUPPORT ACT 

HON. MARK UDALL 

OF COLORADO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, 
today I am introducing a bill to facilitate the 
establishment of additional or expanded training 
ranges in certain States. 

The bill, entitled the ‘‘Target Practice and 
Marksmanship Training Support Act,’’ addresses 
a problem faced by many sportsmen and 
sportswomen and others in Colorado and 
some other States where population growth— 
and resulting public-safety concerns—has 
forced the Forest Service and other Federal 

land-managing agencies to bar target shooting 
on some parts of their lands where that activity 
was previously allowed. 

The result has been a serious reduction in 
the number of appropriate places for target 
shooting that are readily accessible, which unfortunately 
means that in some cases such 
shooting occurs in places that are not suitable 
for that purpose and where that activity can 
endanger public safety. 

My new bill would respond to this problem 
by revising the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration 
Act—often called the Pittman-Robertson 
Act—to give certain States temporary authority 
to use more of the Federal funds provided 
under that law for the establishment of new 
public target ranges or the enlargement or improvement 
of existing public target ranges. 
This authority would continue for ten fiscal 
years. 

It would also make some other changes to 
that same law in order to help qualifying 
States work toward that goal. 

The bill would apply to States where there 
has been at least a 2 percent growth in population 
since the most recent decennial census 
and where there has been a reduction in the 
acreage of Federal lands open to use for target 
practice and marksmanship training. 

Also, to allay concerns by Federal land 
managers about potential liability related to allowing 
Federal land areas to be used for target 
practice and marksmanship training, the 
bill includes provisions to make clear that—(1) 
such a decision will be considered a discretionary 
function for purposes of the Federal 
Torts Claim Act; and (2) any potential liability 
of the United States for damages related to 
any activity at a public target range wholly or 
partially funded by the Federal government will 
be subject to the limits specified in the Federal 
Torts Claim Act. 

And, finally, the bill includes a section expressing 
the sense of Congress that the Forest 
Service and Bureau of Land Management 
should cooperate with State and local authorities 
and other entities to carry out environmental 
remediation or other actions needed to 
allow target practice and marksmanship training 
to continue on lands managed by those 
Federal agencies. 

Madam Speaker, this bill will not increase 
Federal spending and it does not require any 
State to use any of the funds it receives under 
the Pittman-Robertson funds for any new purpose. 
But it would provide eligible States additional 
flexibility regarding the use of those 
funds if they decide to use more of those 
funds for establishment of new public target 
ranges or improvement or expansion of existing 
ranges. For the benefit of our colleagues, 
here is an outline of the bill’s provisions: 

OUTLINE OF TARGET PRACTICE AND MARKSMANSHIP 

TRAINING SUPPORT ACT 

This proposed bill would address both the 
funding and liability issues to make it easier 
for State wildlife departments to work with 
Federal land agencies on establishing and improving 
safe and convenient target practice 
and marksmanship training facilities. 

WHAT THE PROPOSED BILL WOULD DO 

Provides additional funding flexibility to 
states: The bill would amend the Pittman-Robertson 
Act to allow eligible States to increase 
the extent to which eligible States could use 
Federal funds they receive under that law to 
establish new, expanded, or improved shooting 
ranges (including acquisition of lands for 
that purpose). 

—Eligible States would be those that have 
experienced at least 2 percent population 
growth since 2000 and have seen a reduction 
of the extent to which target practice and 
marksmanship training can take place on Federal 
lands within their borders. 

—Eligible States could apply for up to 90 
percent of the cost of acquiring land for and/ 
or construction of new, expanded, or improved 
facilities (current law caps Federal share at 75 
percent) and could retain the funds until expended 
(current law requires funds unused in 
the year received to be refunded to the Federal 
government). 

—In addition, the bill would temporarily 
allow eligible States to use up to 10 percent 
of the Pittman-Robertson funds provided for 
wildlife management and conservation for acquiring 
land for and/or construction of new, expanded, 
or improved shooting ranges and to 
assist in cleanup or other steps needed to 
allow Federal lands to be used for target practice 
or marksmanship training. This provision 
would expire after 10 fiscal years. 

Addresses liability concerns: The bill makes 
it clear that shooting ranges on Federal lands 
do not expose the Federal land agency to liability 
for injuries that may occur at these facilities. 


Encourages Cooperation: The bill states 
sense of Congress that Federal land managers 
should cooperate with States, local government, 
and other entities in doing what’s 
needed to permit Federal lands to remain 
available for public target practice and marksmanship 
training. 

WHAT THE PROPOSED BILL WOULD NOT DO 

Impose a mandate on States: The bill would 
provide an opportunity for eligible States to receive 
additional funds for specific purposes, 
but does not require any funds to be spent for 
those purposes. 

Raise any Taxes: The bill would broaden 
the uses for Pittman-Robertson funds can be 
used, but does not increase the excise taxes 
from which such funds are derived.

MILITARY BATTLES WITH HIGH 
ENERGY PRICES 

HON. JOE WILSON 

OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, as Americans struggle with high gas 
prices our military is also facing skyrocketing 
energy costs. The vehicles needed to transport 
our military and take the fight to our enemies 
require extraordinary amounts of fuel. 

This is a startling example of how rising energy 
prices directly affect our national security. 
It is another example of why Democrats must 
not adjourn for their five-week vacation without 
addressing this issue. 

Between 1997 and 2007, ten years, military 
fuel costs grew from $3 billion to $11.4 billion, 
which is a 380 percent increase. Meanwhile, 
consumption of fuel by the military grew only 
26 percent. 

We need, and the American people are demanding, 
a comprehensive strategy that creates 
more American-made energy by drilling 
for oil and natural gas, building new refineries, 
investing in renewable energy, and promoting 
conservation. House Democrats should take a 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1661 

bipartisan approach and bring the House Republican 
all-of-the-above energy bill to the 
floor for a vote. Let the American people’s 
voices be heard. 

In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we 
will never forget September 11th.

honor Mr. Samuel Snow from Leesburg, Florida. 
Mr. Snow is a hero and a role model for 
every American, and especially African-Americans. 
At a time when most people would have 
rightly succumbed to anger and bitterness, 
Samuel Snow stood taller than us all. 

Sixty-four years ago, Samuel and other African-
American soldiers were accused and convicted 
of a crime they did not commit at Fort 
Lawton, in Seattle, one of the communities I 
represent. Last weekend, Assistant Secretary 
of the Army Ronald James came to Seattle to 
deliver an eloquent and heartfelt apology on 
behalf of the Army, and to honor the soldiers, 
including Samuel Snow, with honorable discharge 
plaques. 

Mr. Snow’s son, Ray, stood in for his father 
when Samuel was hospitalized unexpectedly. 
After the ceremony in which I was honored to 
participate, Ray Snow took the honorable discharge 
plaque to a Seattle hospital, where he 
showed it to his father and read Samuel the 
inscription. According to Ray, his father smiled 
broadly as he held the plaque. A few hours 
later, Samuel Snow died with his family at his 
side. His son Ray would say: ‘‘My dad has 
been standing in formation all these years 
waiting to have his name cleared. With the 
Army’s honorable discharge he was at ease. 
He now has his discharge papers and he went 
home.’’ 

I am very proud to have had the honor and 
privilege of meeting and getting to know Samuel 
Snow, his family, and the families of the 
other soldiers whose fathers and grandfathers 
were falsely accused and convicted, and 
needlessly paid a heavy price for this racial injustice 
throughout their lives. 

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said: ‘‘An injustice 
anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. 
Samuel Snow lived to lead the fight 
against a racial injustice that is a stain on our 
nation’s history.’’ 

Samuel Snow was a man full of courage 
and optimism who had a wonderful sense of 
humor and a deep well of courage and conviction. 
He knew what was right and just, and he 
died knowing that he had finally defeated the 
racial injustice that had tried, and failed, to 
strike him down. 

Samuel Snow raised a wonderful family and 
he lived a quiet, humble life working as a janitor, 
not once complaining about what might 
have been in life had he not been unfairly deprived 
of his GI benefits. 

Samuel Snow’s life will inspire others to 
fight for what is right and just, and to never 
give up on the country he loved so much. I 
was privileged to stand in the company of a 
giant of a man and I am certain that Samuel 
Snow, an American hero, will not be forgotten. 

TRIBUTE TO THE 345TH TACTICAL 

PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATING 

COMPANY (AIRBORNE) 

HON. SAM JOHNSON 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, as the 345th Tactical Psychological 
Operations Company (Airborne) prepares to 
deploy to Afghanistan, I ask the Congress to 
join me in commending the distinguished military 
company. To the brave men and women 
off to serve on the front lines, thank you. God 
bless you and I salute you. 

245th PSYOP Co. was constituted into the 
regular Army on December 20, 1965. The unit 
deployed to Vietnam in February, 1966. The 
245th was assigned to the 6th BN, 7th 
PSYOP Group. 245th elements supported the 
1 CAV DIV, 101st ABN DIV, and was awarded 
a Meritorious Unit Citation and Vietnam Cross 
of Gallantry with Palm Device. 

Deactivated in January 1968. The 245th 
was reconstituted on October 30, 1975 in the 
Army Reserve under the 90th ARCOM, 5th 

U.S. Army. 
In 1980, the 245th supported the Cuban 
Refugee Resettlement Project at Ft. McCoy, 
WI. The 245th was placed under USACAPOC 
and U.S. Army Special Operations Command 
in 1990. December 27, 1990, 18 soldiers mobilized 
to support Operation Desert Shield. 

Tactical PSYOP Teams conducted combat 
operations with elements of the 1st, 2nd Marine 
Divisions and the 5th Special Forces 
Group during Operation Desert Storm. 245th 
teams distinguished themselves at the Battle 
of Khafji, the liberation of Kuwait City, and with 
deception and surrender appeals in the Kuwaiti 
desert. Members earned Marine Combat 
Action Ribbons, Navy Meritorious Unit Commendations, 
and four Bronze Stars. The 245th 
also earned the Army Meritorious Unit Commendation. 


September 16, 1994, a Tactical Detachment 
deployed to Haiti in support of Operation Uphold 
Democracy. Two soldiers supported a 
team of the 3rd Special Forces Group and the 
rest were with the 10th Mountain DIV. TPTs 
conducted civilian non-intereference, civil information 
campaigns, and QRF operations. 

In 1996, the 245th was redesignated the 
345th Tactical PSYOP Co. (Airborne), 16th 
BN, 2nd PSYOP GRP. The unit conducted numerous 
training exercises at JRTC, NTC, and 
CMTC in Germany. 

In 1997, the 345th was given the warning 
order to deploy to the Balkans for Operation 
Joint Guard. In 1998, the unit operated in war-
torn Bosnia. The unit was primarily in the 
Multi-National Division North supporting the 3/ 
2 Armored Cavalry Regiment. Other soldiers 
were in Sarajevo and Banja Luka. Teams conducted 
presence patrols in the Zone of Separation 
between the Serbs, Muslims, and 
Croats, civilian non-interference, civil information 
campaign, mine awareness, and passive 
intelligence gathering. 

In 2000, a Tactical Detachment deployed to 
Kosovo to conduct missions, in support of Operation 
Joint Guardian. KFOR Teams ran similar 
missions as in Bosnia, with their 310th 
PSYOP Co. counterparts and the 82nd ABN 
DIV. 

In the late 1990s through the early 2000s, 
the OPTEMPO of the unit steadily increased 

with missions to Germany, Jordan, Oman, and 
Egypt. However, on September 11, 2001, the 
345th prepared to defend freedom with the 
onset of the Global War on Terror. 

In 2002, three Tactical Detachments and a 
Headquarters/PDD deployed with the 3rd Special 
Forces Group’s 1st BN to Afghanistan for 
Operation Enduring Freedom. 345th Teams 
were spread throughout the country to work 
with 3rd, 19th, 20th, and 7th SF GRP ODAs, 
other government agencies, Afghan militias, 
and conventional soldiers to hunt hostile 
Taliban and Al Qaeda terrorists, conduct civilian 
non-interference, tactical deception, surrender 
appeals, special recon, mine awareness, 
sensitive site exploitation, and direct action 
in support of unconventional warfare. 
345th soldiers were recognized with numerous 
awards. The unit has had soldiers continuously 
deployed to OEF since, where they continue 
to set the standard for special operations 
in austere environments. 

With less than a year home, the 345th was 
given a warning order to prepare to deploy in 
support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. From 
February to October 2004, the 345th was assigned 
responsibility for tactical PSYOP in 
Baghdad, Iraq supporting elements of the 1st 
Armored Division, 1st Cavalry Division, 10th 
Mountain Division, and numerous other special 
operations, foreign, and host nation 
forces. Teams conducted the full spectrum of 
military operations in urban terrain. From direct 
action raids, cordon and searches, and 
sonic deception to humanitarian assistance, 
345th teams were involved in direct combat 
operations against anti-coalition forces, foreign 
terrorists, Al Sadr’s Mahdi Army militia, former 
Baathists, and other hostile forces. Six Purple 
Hearts were awarded and a multitude of other 
awards to individual soldiers and the unit. The 
345th remains actively engaged in this theater, 
as well. 

In 2006, reserve component PSYOP units 
were reassigned to the U.S. Army Reserve 
Command, though continue to train through 
the U.S. Army’s JFK Special Warfare Center 
and School. 

345th Soldiers have sent soldiers on every 
rotation in support of the Global War on Terror 
since 9–11. 345th soldiers have also been 
called to serve in small teams or as individuals 
in Romania, Korea, Japan, Ecuador, Germany, 
Italy, and Egypt with no sign of letting 
up. 345th soldiers continue to attend professional 
schools, training rotations, and prepare 
for future combat deployments.

RECOGNIZING THE OAKLAND COM


POSITE SQUADRON COLOR 

GUARD TEAM 

HON. JOE KNOLLENBERG 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. KNOLLENBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
want to recognize the Oakland Composite 
Squadron Color Guard Team for their excellent 
performance at the National Cadet Competition 
last month. The members of the team 
have and continue to represent the Civil Air 
Patrol with honor, distinction, and professionalism. 


The Civil Air Patrol, CAP, was established 
on December 1, 1947, as the all volunteer 


E1662 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

auxiliary of the United States Air Force. Today 
there are more than 56,000 members in the 
50 States, District of Columbia, and Puerto 
Rico. The membership of the CAP is comprised 
of cadets between the ages of 12 and 
18, and senior members, who are 18 or older. 
The Michigan Wing of the CAP currently has 
487 cadets and 740 senior members. The 
CAP has three missions; to run cadet programs 
to build character, leadership, patriotism, 
and honor; to promote aerospace education; 
and to serve as a primary resource for 
the U.S. Air Force Rescue Coordination Center. 


The Oakland Composite Squadron, which is 
located in Waterford, Michigan, has 57 members, 
29 of whom are cadets. Earlier this year, 
five of those cadets stepped forward to serve 
as members of the squadron’s Color Guard 
Team. The team appears at public events like 
parades and veterans’ ceremonies presenting 
and posting colors. They also participated in 
Color Guard competitions which require dedication, 
team work, and exceptional academic 
success. 

After embarking on a rigorous training regimen 
that required physical and mental discipline, 
the Oakland Composite Squadron 
Color Guard went on to win first place overall 
at the Michigan Wing competition after sweeping 
all seven events on March 30. Then, on 
May 4, the team once again won first place 
overall at the Great Lakes Regional competition. 
They would go on to represent the entire 
region, consisting of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, 
Illinois, Kentucky, and Wisconsin in the National 
Cadet Competition on June 30. At the 
National Competition, the team took second 
place in the Academic Panel Quiz and tied for 
third place overall. 

Madam Speaker, I wish to congratulate 
these cadets for their hard work and dedication. 
I am proud to represent these young men 
and women who have shown such character 
in competition. Theirs is a shining example of 
what we are all capable of achieving with 
dedication and hard work.

THE FUEL IMMIGRATION 
ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2008 

HON. HARRY E. MITCHELL 

OF ARIZONA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. MITCHELL. Madam Speaker, Today I, 
along with Representatives CHRIS SHAYS and 
HEATH SHULER, introduced H.R. 6687, the Fuel 
Immigration Enforcement Act of 2008. 

This bill would help ensure that Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement (‘‘ICE’’) has the resources 
it needs to enforce our nation’s immigration 
laws in the face of the rising cost of 
fuel. 

Last year, ICE budgeted $20 million for fuel 
expenses, but the rising price of gas forced 
them to spend more than $40 million. 

Even more alarming, it appears the $20 million 
fuel budget was based on an assumption 
by the Department of Homeland Security that 
the price of gas was approximately $1.62 per 
gallon. 

The Fuel Immigration Enforcement Act 
would require the Department of Homeland 
security to begin using realistic estimates for 
ICE’s fuel expenses. Specifically, it would re


quire the Department to calculate, on an annual 
basis, the cost of fuel expenses for all vehicles 
owned or operated by ICE according to 
gasoline prices reported by the U.S. Department 
of Energy’s Energy Information Administration 
Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update, and 
then report those calculations to Congress. 

ICE is tasked with enforcing our nation’s immigration 
laws, and is absolutely critical to the 
Phoenix metropolitan area as well as other 
metropolitan areas in the southwest where 
criminal aliens set up drop houses as way stations 
for drug, weapon and human smuggling 
operations. The Phoenix metro area in particular 
is estimated to have as many as 1000 
such drop houses. 

The House Appropriations Committee recently 
said, in no uncertain terms, that, ‘‘ICE 
should have no greater immigration enforcement 
priority than to remove violent, deport-
able criminal aliens from the United States.’’ I 
couldn’t agree more. 

We need to ensure that ICE has the resources 
it needs to crack down on drop 
houses and other criminal alien enterprises. 
When ICE is unable to meet its responsibilities, 
it falls to local law enforcement to fill the 
gap. Our local law enforcement is already 
stretched thin, and I fear the burden will be 
even greater if ICE is forced to scale back its 
efforts due to an increase in the price of gas. 

If we are serious about enforcing our nation’s 
immigrations laws, we need to provide 
the resources necessary to get the job done. 
The Fuel Immigration Enforcement Act will 
help ensure that ICE has what it needs, in the 
face of rising fuel expenses. 

I encourage my colleagues to support this 
bill.

RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVER


SARY OF THE INTEGRATION OF 

THE ARMED FORCES 

HON. KATHY CASTOR 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Ms. CASTOR. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to recognize the 60th anniversary of 
the signing of Executive Order 9981, in which 
President Truman ordered the racial integration 
of the Armed Forces, declaring that, 
‘‘there be equality of treatment and opportunity 
for all persons in the Armed Services without 
regard to race, color, religion or national origin.’’ 


While it is fitting that we celebrate the official 
60-year anniversary, we should also recognize 
that African Americans have been 
fighting on behalf of our Nation from the American 
Revolutionary War to the current Global 
War on Terror. The sacrifices made and service 
given by African American soldiers to our 
country, even when our country failed to live 
up to its own promise of equality and justice 
for all, is a testament to their belief that hard 
work and faith would eventually allow them to 
become full partners in every facet of society, 
including our Armed Forces. 

The celebration of this anniversary also 
gives me an opportunity to recognize a trailblazing 
African American woman from my 
hometown who was among the first five African 
American women in Tampa to join the 
Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps back in 1942, 

six years prior to the signing of the Executive 
Order. Mrs. Willie Mae Williams, who celebrated 
her 95th birthday this past November, 
proudly served her nation paving the way for 
others from her community, and women in 
particular, to follow in her steps. 

In her recent interview with the Women Veterans 
Historical Project for the Library of Congress, 
Mrs. Williams gave a very candid and 
informative look at the experience she had in 
the military as a woman of color. At that time, 
women were not allowed to face combat, instead 
serving as cooks and laundry workers, 
who often had to go together in groups to take 
showers to ensure their safety, and who endured 
taunts from officers who opposed their 
participation, either on the basis of their gender 
or color, and in some instances both. 
While Mrs. Williams acknowledged that life in 
the service for women of color was ‘‘rough’’, 
she certainly views herself and others as role 
models for the women who came after. She 
observed, ‘‘We were good pioneers.’’ 

Indeed, the service of Mrs. Williams and 
other women like her has led to the growth in 
service of African American women and men 
throughout the years. Currently, 20 percent of 
the more than 1,754,900 service members 
who have fought in support of the ongoing Operation 
Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring 
Freedom are minorities, evidence that the 
United States could not maintain an all-volunteer 
force without the service of and critical 
role played by minorities, including women. 

Our Armed Forces have been served by 
some of the most brilliant African American 
leaders from Benjamin O. Davis Senior and 
Junior to Colin Powell as Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff Today, minorities serve in 
senior leadership positions throughout the 
Armed Forces, as commissioned, warrant and 
non-commissioned officers. The advancement 
of these men and women is evidence that the 
integration of the Armed Forces not only enhanced 
the combat effectiveness of the military 
60 years ago, but continues still to ensure 
that America has a diverse array of its best 
and brightest working to defend it. 

I am pleased to commemorate this historic 
event, and salute all our brave men and 
women who have served us so well through 
the years.

IN HONOR OF SGT MARCO 
ROBLEDO 

HON. JOHN BOOZMAN 

OF ARKANSAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam, Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of a great American hero, SGT 
Marco Robledo from the Third District of Arkansas. 


Marco has selflessly served in the United 
States Army. The commitment he showed his 
fellow soldiers and his country is something 
we can all be proud of. 

On May 26, 2007, Marco was injured in 
Iraq. He lost his left arm and his left leg, but 
he still has a strong spirit and he’s made lasting 
impressions with me and with others 
who’ve had the opportunity to meet him. 

In honor of his sacrifice Albert Casewell 
wrote the following poem:

TRIBUTE TO RETIRING GEN 
RICHARD A. CODY 

HON. IKE SKELTON 

OF MISSOURI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, let me 
take this opportunity to recognize the long and 
distinguished career of GEN Richard A. Cody 
who is retiring after serving our nation’s military 
with distinction for 36 years. 

General Cody was born in Montpelier, 
Vermont. He is a graduate from the United 
States Military Academy. General Cody’s military 
education also includes the Command 
and General Staff College and the United 
States Army War College. General Cody is a 
Master Aviator with over 5,000 hours of flight 
time and is an Air Assault graduate. 

General Cody has received numerous decorations 
and badges for his outstanding efforts 
in the United States Army. These decorations 
and badges include the Distinguished Service 
Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, the 
Legion of Merit (with four Oak Leaf Clusters), 
the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze 
Star Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal 
(with 4 Oak Leaf Clusters), the Air Medal (with 
numeral device ‘‘3’’), the Army Commendation 
Medal (with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters), the Army 
Achievement Medal, the NATO medal, as well 
as various other service awards. 

General Cody became the 31st Vice Chief 
of Staff, United States Army, on June 24, 
2004. He and his wife are also very proud of 
their two sons, who both are serving as commissioned 
officers in the United States Army. 

Madam Speaker, I know that Members of 
the House will join me in paying tribute to 
GEN Richard A. Cody for his exceptional commitment 
to his fellow soldiers, the United 
States Army, and the safety and security of 
America. As he prepares for the next stage in 
his life, I am certain that my colleagues will 
join in me in wishing General Cody, his wife, 
and their two sons all the best.

CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, 

CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY 

IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 

SPEECH OF 

HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 

OF MINNESOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the 
Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act 

(H.R. 4040) and to commend Chairman DINGELL 
and the conferees for their hard work on 
this important issue. In a recent letter to the 
conferees, I joined several other members in 
support of this bill and I am pleased that Congress 
is moving forward on this legislation that 
will help ensure the safety of America’s children 
and consumers. 
According to a leading consumer rights 
group, more than 45 million toys and children’s 
products were recalled because of unsafe 
toxins and choking hazards in 2007. Data 
for 2008 shows that there have been 22 percent 
more recalls in the first half of this year 
as compared to the same period in 2007. Toy 

safety, which has been called ‘‘last year’s 
problem’’ by the toy industry, is still very much 
an urgent, current challenge. Congress must 
act to ensure that the products and toys our 
children are exposed to are free of toxins and 
hazards. 

The Consumer Product Safety Modernization 
Act takes bold measures to enhance the 
safety of products available to our children. 
This legislation takes a strong stand against 
destructive oil industry interests by banning 
toxic phthalates in children’s toys. Studies indicate 
that exposure to phthalates in childhood 
increases the risk of cancer as an adult. It 
mandates third-party testing and certification 
for certain children’s toys and materials, which 
were previously voluntary. The bill also has 
new protections for whistleblowers that will 
help ensure consumer safety by making it 
easier for employees to alert the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) about 
possible hazards before products reach the 
public. 

Part of the toy safety problem has been the 
lack of capacity of the CPSC. The CPSC has 
been underfunded and inadequately equipped 
to ensure the safety of the products available 
to children. Staff levels at CPSC are currently 
less than half of 1980 levels. The Consumer 
Product Safety Modernization Act bolsters 
CPSC capacity by increasing funding and 
staffing for the agency, a significant step toward 
ensuring safety for our children. Also, by 
banning industry-sponsored travel by CPSC 
Commissioners and staff and restoring the 
five-member commission, the legislation prevents 
potential conflicts of interest that may 
jeopardize toy safety. 

It is unacceptable for parents to have to 
worry about toys harming their children. The 
Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act is 
timely and targeted bipartisan legislation that 
takes significant steps to ensure that America’s 
children are kept safe from harmful toxins 
in their toys. I urge my colleagues to support 
the Consumer Product Safety Modernization 
Act and give this bill my full support.

FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION 
AND TOBACCCO CONTROL ACT 

SPEECH OF 

HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 

OF CONNECTICUT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 1108, the Family Smoking 
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. This legislation 
would grant the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) long-needed authority to regulate 
the manufacture, sale, distribution and 
marketing of tobacco products. 

As we all know, tobacco use contributes to 
the death of more than 400,000 Americans 
and costs the nation’s health care system 
nearly $100 billion each year. The most tragic 
part of this statistic is that virtually all of these 
deaths are preventable. It is alarming that preventable 
diseases such as emphysema, heart 
disease and cancer all can be attributed to the 
use of tobacco. 

In addition to providing consumers with 
science-based information about tobacco 
products, granting FDA the authority to regulate 
tobacco will more importantly help protect 


E1664 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

our children from using these products. Approximately 
90 percent of all adult smokers 
began their habit while in their teens, or earlier, 
and two-thirds become regular, daily 
smokers before they reach the age of 19. According 
to the American Medical Association, 
each day, about 4,000 children try smoking a 
cigarette for the first time and another 1,000 
become new, regular, daily smokers. This 
means that one-third of these children will die 
prematurely. 

Despite their claims to the contrary, the tobacco 
companies continue to market their 
products aggressively toward children. This bill 
will give FDA the authority to impose marketing 
restrictions, labeling requirements, as 
well as to ban candy flavored tobacco products 
in order to prevent tobacco companies 
from addicting children to tobacco. 

I am also pleased that the bill before us includes 
language that maintains the same role 
of the Appropriations Committee with regard to 
the fees in this bill that the Committee has 
with regard to other FDA user fees. 

This bill has strong bipartisan support, and 
is endorsed by key groups including the American 
Cancer Society, the American Medical 
Association, the American Heart Association, 
the American Lung Association, and Campaign 
for Tobacco-Free Kids. 

I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

OPTIONAL ELECTRONIC PAY 
STUBS FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES 

SPEECH OF 

HON. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, July 29, 2008 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 6073, ‘‘To provide 
that Federal employees receiving their 
pay by electronic funds transfer shall be given 
the option of receiving their pay stubs electronically.’’ 
First, I would like to thank my colleague, 
VIRGINIA FOXX of North Carolina, for 
introducing this important legislation. This bill 
will allow all Federal employees receiving their 
pay by electronic funds transfer to receive 
their pay stubs electronically. This will bring 
much needed reform to a system that has become 
less transparent due to the advent of 
electronic, online banking. I strongly encourage 
my colleagues to support this act. 

H.R. 6073 is important because of the need 
to create a streamlined, direct pay system that 
is at the same time transparent with clear authentication, 
allowing the over 1 million Federal 
employees to be able to back up their 
electronic funds with electronic pay stubs. 
These pay stubs will provide a necessary, 
substantive back-up to ensure that the many 
employees using electronic funds transfer 
have the same access to a transparent financial 
record. 
H.R. 6073, ‘‘To provide that Federal employees 
receiving their pay by electronic funds 
transfer shall be given the option of receiving 
their pay stubs electronically,’’ is a fair, equitable 
step that will bring the Federal Government 
toward a clearer, more direct standard 
for all Federal employees using electronic 
funds transfer. 
Upon enactment of the act, the Office of 
Personnel Management, OPM, would be re


quired to provide Federal employees that receive 
their pay through electronic transfer with 
the option of also receiving their pay stubs 
electronically. The Congressional Budget Office 
estimates that implementation of this act 
will have no effect on the budget, and this act 
does not contain any intergovernmental or private 
sector mandates, and hence does not 
apply to local or State governments. 

This bill will benefit the many thousands of 
Federal employees receiving their pay by electronic 
funds transfer by giving them the option 
to receive their pay stubs electronically. This 
option will provide greater authentication and 
transparency, without costing taxpayers, and 
without affecting private businesses, and State 
and local government. 

This bipartisan bill will benefit the many 
Federal Government employees in Houston, 
Texas, and the Nation as a whole, while coming 
at no cost to the taxpayers of Texas’ 18th. 
This simple reform should create an improved 
electronic pay system, benefiting countless 
Government employees.

IN HONOR OF ADRIAN 
MALDONADO 

HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of Adrian Maldonado on the occasion 
of his retirement as Director of the Office 
of Procurement and Diversity in Cuyahoga 
County. His vision, leadership and commitment 
to his work has had a profound impact 
on developing Cuyahoga County and on the 
Greater Cleveland community. 

Adrian Maldonado began his career in public 
service twenty-seven years ago, when he 
was hired as a personnel interviewer at 
MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, 
Ohio. Four years later, in 1985, he began 
working for the State of Ohio in the Department 
of Administrative Services as a minority 
business specialist. For fourteen years, he 
worked tirelessly with minority business entrepreneurs 
in my district, helping them secure 
contracts under Ohio’s HB584 Minority Set-
Aside program after almost eleven years, he is 
retiring from his position as the Director of Diversity 
and Procurement in Cuyahoga County. 

Mr. Maldonado’s leadership and vision as 
Director of the Office of Procurement and Diversity 
for Cuyahoga County changed the 
county immensely. He and his staff worked 
diligently to improve the county’s purchasing 
operating system and its purchasing and operating 
procedures, leading the county to be recognized 
by Purchasing Magazine as one of 
country’s top Big 20 Purchasers. Under his 
leadership, the Office of Procurement and Diversity 
created a small business enterprise 
program which assists small businesses in 
procuring county contracts. Since implementing 
this program, Cuyahoga County has 
consistently met or exceeded the 30% subcontracting 
goal for all county contracts. 

Madam Speaker and colleagues, please join 
me in honor of Adrian Maldonado, and in recognition 
of his leadership, vision and dedication 
to his work and to the community.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mrs. CAPITO. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the career and accomplishments of Steven 
Michael Worley of Cabin Creek, West Virginia. 


For the more than 33 years, Michael Worley 
has been a leader of several personal and 
professional development opportunities across 
many states, including the great state of West 
Virginia. A graduate of West Virginia Institute 
of Technology in 1975 with a Bachelor of

of Engineering Division, where he worked on 
a variety of major reservoir and local protection 
projects in relocating public facilities from 
the construction work areas. Over the next 20 
years, Michael’s professional career consisted 
of working with Planning Division and serving 
as project manager for a variety of inland navigation, 
riverfront park, and nonstructural flood 
protection projects. Since 2001, Mike has 
served as the Chief of Planning Branch. 

For all of his service, Michael has received 
numerous awards. He was selected as Ohio 
River Division Civilian of the Year in 1993 as 
well as Corps-wide Civilian of the Year in 
1993. He was also honored with the J.W. Morris 
medallion. Michael received the National 
Performance Review, awarded to the Section 
202 Non-structural Flood Proofing Team, from 
Vice President Al Gore. In 2004, he was 
named Special Emphasis Program Supervisor 
of the Year. These are just a few of the mentionable 
awards Michael has received for all 
his leadership and hard work. 

He and his wife, Katie, have been married 
since 1975, and have raised two children, Erin 
Worley Haughey (married to Andy Haughey) 
and Ryan Worley. Katie is the Office Manager 
for Huntington Physical Therapy in Charleston. 
Erin Worley and her husband are owner/operators 
of four McDonald’s franchises while 
Ryan Worley is owner of Epicenter Art Studio. 

Michael represents the true calling of public 
service. It is an honor to work with such a distinguished 
citizen who has contributed so 
much to our great state. I’m proud to call Michael 
Worley a friend and a fellow West Virginian. 
I wish him all best in his retirement.

IN HONOR OF MS. MARGI PRUITT 
CEO OF THE DELMARVA PENINSULA 
CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN 
RED CROSS 

HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE 

OF DELAWARE 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. CASTLE. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise today to recognize 
Ms. Margi Pruitt for her dedication and service 
to the American Red Cross. She will retire 
from her post as CEO of the Delmarva Peninsula 
Chapter of the American Red Cross in 
October after thirty five years of excellent work 
helping Americans in need. 

Margi began working for the Delaware 
Chapter of the American Red Cross in 1973,

immediately after graduating from college. Fol-CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, HONORING THE REDWOOD CHAP-
lowing service to the American Red Cross in CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY TER OF THE SIERRA CLUB ON 
seven different states, Margi returned to the IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
same branch—now known as the Delmarva 

Peninsula Chapter—and has remained there 
for the past twenty years. During this time, she 
has worked to orchestrate relief efforts for 
large disasters such as flooding in the 
Elsmere region of northern Delaware, several 
winter storms along the east coast, a tornado 
in Smyrna, Delaware, and most recently, substantial 
flooding in Kent and Sussex Counties 
following a series of severe thunderstorms. In 
addition, she led volunteers in the relief effort 
for victims of both Hurricane Andrew and Hurricane 
Katrina. Her dedication and compassion 
have helped the American Red Cross reach 
countless people affected by natural disasters 
in the Delmarva region and throughout the 
United States. 

I, along with the rest of the Delaware Congressional 
delegation, have had the personal 
privilege of collaborating with Margi on several 
occasions, and we have witnessed her untiring 
dedication to strengthening the American Red 
Cross’s presence in our state. Margi has 
worked to build strong partnerships with emergency 
management throughout the state of 
Delaware. Following the attacks on September 
11, 2001, she was instrumental in launching a 
public awareness campaign to help those in 
the community better understand the assistance 
that is available to them through the 
American Red Cross. 

I acknowledge and thank Ms. Margi Pruitt 
for her commitment to the American Red 
Cross. The entire State of Delaware has benefited 
from her innumerable contributions to 
help people manage the most difficult and trying 
of situations. I am confident that her kind 
and diligent presence, though it will be missed 
by her colleagues on the occasion of her retirement 
from the American Red Cross, will remain 
an active influence in our community.

TRIBUTE TO BOB OWENS 

HON. TOM LATHAM 

OF IOWA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and congratulate Bob Owens of 
Jefferson, Iowa, on earning the Meritorious 
Achievement Award of 2008. 

Bob Owens is a consul and charter member 
for the Greene County chapter of the Lincoln 
Highway Association. He is one of the original 
43 members who met in 1992 in Ogden, Iowa, 
to recognize the National Lincoln Highway Association 
for the first time since 1915. Today, 
the national organization has over 1,900 members 
due in no small part to the dedication and 
commitment Bob has given to the organization. 


I know that my colleagues in the United 
States Congress join me in commending Bob 
Owens for his leadership and dedication to 
representing Iowa in the Lincoln Highway Association. 
I consider it an honor to reprent Bob 
and his family in Congress, and I wish him the 
best in his future endeavors. 

SPEECH OF 

HON. JAMES R. LANGEVIN 

OF RHODE ISLAND 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Conference Report on 

H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement 
Act. This measure will improve and 
reform the Nation’s consumer product safety 
system by restructuring and increasing resources 
for the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission, which has long been underfunded 
and stretched too thin. 
Unfortunately, this past year we learned the 
extent to which the CPSC had failed to protect 
the American consumer by the high volume of 
recalls, including children’s toys and cribs. To 
help get this agency back on track, H.R. 4040 
provides a comprehensive response to the toy 
safety crisis by creating the toughest lead 
standard in the world for children’s products 
and helps ensure consumers know when 
products are recalled. This legislation also 
strengthens the currently underfunded and 
understaffed Consumer Product Safety Commission 
and significantly increases CPSC resources 
to hire additional staff and for laboratory 
renovations. 

The Consumer Product Safety Improvement 
Act also creates new authority for the CPSC 
to immediately share information about dangerous 
products with the public and ensures 
State public health agencies are kept informed. 
Finally, the bill requires manufacturers 
to place distinguishing marks on products and 
packaging to aid in recalls of products. 

I am confident that this bipartisan bill will 
take great strides in protecting consumers and 
children.

future. 

HON. MIKE THOMPSON 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, together with my colleague LYNN 
WOOLSEY, I rise today to congratulate the 
more than 10,000 members of the Redwood 
Chapter of the Sierra Club on the occasion of 
its 50th anniversary. Named after Sequoia 
sempervirens, the Coastal Redwood, whose 
greatest forests are along the North Coast, the 
Chapter remains true to the visionary environmental 
ethic of Sierra Club founder, John 
Muir, striving daily to preserve and protect our 
lands, waters and wildlife. 

The Redwood Chapter, founded in 1958, is 
one of the earliest regional entities of the Sierra 
Club. With six local Groups in nine Northwestern 
Counties, it is a potent force for the 
environment. 

Over the years, the Redwood Chapter has 
marshaled grass roots forces to focus on forest 
preservation, protection of our spectacular 
coast, free-flowing rivers and verdant watersheds, 
sustainable growth management, endangered 
species protection, and the multifaceted 
challenge of global climate change. 
The Chapter played a strong supporting role in 
Sierra Club national initiatives to protect national 
environmental treasures like the Grand 
Canyon while safeguarding our water and air, 
and battling environmental rollbacks. 

Within the Chapter’s 25,000 square miles, it 
has been particularly effective, playing major 
roles in the creation of the Redwood National 
Park, design and construction of the Coastal 
Trail, designation of Federal wilderness areas, 
including the Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel, Snow 
Mountain, Yuki Sanhedrin, Cache Creek, King 
Range and Cedar Roughs Wildernesses; designation 
of numerous State and Federal designated 
Wild and Scenic Rivers, including portions 
of the Smith, Klamath, Gualala, Black 
Butte and Eel Rivers; preservation of the 
7,400 acre Headwaters Forest; implementation 
of conservation management strategies on 
public lands; and development of recovery 
strategies for endangered and threatened species, 
including the marbled murrelet, the spotted 
owl and coastal salmon. 

In recent years, legislative achievements include 
the passage of the Cache Creek Wild 
and Scenic Rivers Act (2005). I am especially 
grateful for the Redwood Chapter’s support for 
my Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act, 
which was enacted in 2006, and Congresswoman 
WOOLSEY’s Gulf of the Farallones and 
Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries 
Boundary Modification and Protection Act, 
which was passed by the House this year. 

Members of the Redwood Chapter have 
also had a profound influence on local politics 
and policies, through its participation in initiatives 
to protect open space and agricultural 
lands, create trails and community separators, 
protect coastal forests, provide new low carbon 
transportation alternatives and promotion 
of smart growth management and climate protection. 


The Club also has played a vital educational, 
service and recreational function. 


E1666 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

Over the past half century thousands of people 
have participated in the Chapter’s ‘‘Outings’’ 
programs, which includes over 6,000 
hikes, nature walks, backpacking journeys, 
canoe trips within the Chapter and elsewhere 
in California, as well as hundreds of trail building 
projects and other service activities. 

Madam Speaker, it is difficult to imagine 
what this area would be like without the Redwood 
Chapter’s passionate resolve to protect 
the land and life that sustains us. What if there 
was no wilderness retreat in our coastal 
headlands? What if our cities were merged in 
endless sprawl? What if our pure rivers and 
streams were diverted, degraded and 
disrespected? We can be thankful that is not 
the case, and largely because the members of 
the Redwood Chapter have been such effective 
advocates for the environment. 

So today, Congresswoman WOOLSEY and I 
congratulate the members of Redwood Chapter 
of the Sierra Club on their achievements in 
their first fifty years. And we look forward to 
the Chapter’s continued active participation in 
public policy debates and to hearing their 
member’s loud, clear, reasoned voice for a 
healthy, vibrant, natural world.

The example set by these young ladies and 
their coach, Shawn Latimer, demonstrates the 

rewards of hard work, dedication and determination. 
They scored victories on the court 
and have positively represented their community 
and school off it as well. Their triumph is

HOUSING AND ECONOMIC 
RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 

SPEECH OF 

HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 

OF OREGON 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I strongly 
supported H.R., 3221, the American Housing 
Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 
2008. Buried in the provisions of this bill, however, 
in section 3082, on page 680, is an expansion 
of the Gulf Opportunity Zone to two 
additional counties in Alabama. One of these 
counties is nearly 300 miles from the coast. 
This section doesn’t have much to do with 
housing. 

This expansion is designed to provide a 
subsidy for National Steel Car, a Canadian rail 
car manufacturer. This subsidy is unnecessary 
for two reasons. First, the plant is already 
under construction and will be operational by 
this time next year. Second, Alabama was 
under a contractual obligation to provide the 
subsidy itself if Congress did not. 

The United States has a domestic rail car 
industry, with plants and facilities around the 
country. In fact, one borders my district, and it 
recently laid off over 100 employees because 
of the economic pressures on the industry. 
That company also has a facility in Alabama, 
but it won’t benefit from this tax provision. 

In Congress, we often talk about not picking 
winners, of letting the market make these decisions 
rather than the Congress, of leveling 
playing fields rather than tilting them. But here 
we picked a winner. We held a secret bidding 
process and a Canadian company won, despite 
the fact that they would have made this 
investment anyway. The longer we pursue this 
method of doling out tax breaks, the harder 
real reform will be. 

The legislation I introduce today will ensure 
that these Alabama counties are able to benefit 
from the expanded GO Zone. The legislation 
also ensures, however, that taxes paid by 
the domestic rail car industry do not go to subsidizing 
their competitors and that we remove 
this rifleshot from the tax code.

Mr. ORTIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Ms. Alma Ortiz, a teacher of U.S. government

School in Brownsville, TX. 

Ms. Ortiz was selected to the House Fellows

provides an opportunity for teachers to learn 
more about government and improve their 
knowledge of Congress. Only twelve participants 
were selected from around the country. 

Those teachers will then take their experiences

back home. 

It is dedicated teachers like Ms. Ortiz who 
will ensure our students have a better understanding 
of government. She already has 
made a positive impact on her students, fellow 
teachers, and school administrators with her 
work ethic and enthusiasm. 

It is important for our students to be engaged 
in the civic process. They are our future 
leaders and a key understanding of government, 
as well as an appreciation for history, is 
important for their success. 

I congratulate Ms. Alma Ortiz on all her accomplishments.

FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF I–35W 
BRIDGE COLLAPSE 

HON. JAMES L. OBERSTAR 

OF MINNESOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise lo 
mark the first anniversary of a tragedy in my 
home state, a tragedy that touches all Americans. 
At 6:05 p.m. on August 1, 2007, the I– 
35W Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, collapsed 
into the Mississippi River, killing 13 
people. The eight-lane, steel truss bridge 
span, which was constructed in 1967, carried 
approximately 140,000 vehicles daily. 

Within just six minutes of the bridge collapse, 
emergency personnel responded to the 
scene, risking their own health and safety to 
rescue victims and to provide care to the injured. 
Within three hours, first responders 
were able to complete the rescue of victims 
stranded on the bridge. The swift and heroic 
actions of the first responders that day saved 
countless lives and were critical in minimizing 
the potential for more loss of life. 

I received the tragic news of the bridge collapse 
while standing on the floor of this 
House, managing the Water Resources Development 
Act. The Transportation Committee 
staff and I immediately began developing legislation 
to help the City of Minneapolis, the 
Twin Cities metropolitan area, and the State of 
Minnesota cope with the loss of a major transportation 
artery, and rebuild after the terrible 
tragedy. The Committee approved my legislation 
the following morning, and the House 
passed H.R. 3311, authorizing up to $250 million 
to carry our emergency repairs and reconstruction 
of the bridge and $5 million for transit 
needs less than 48 hours after the tragedy occurred. 
To date, a total of $371 million in Fed


eral funding has been provided for the cleanup 
and reconstruction of this crossing. 

Construction of a replacement bridge on I– 
35W has moved swiftly. By late October, 
2007, major work to replace the bridge had 
begun, and by mid-April of this year construction 
crews had reached the half-way point in 
the project. This week, crews will finish pouring 
the concrete on the final span of the new 
bridge as construction continues ahead of 
schedule. The new bridge is expected to open 
on December 24, 2008. 

This tragedy demonstrates the need to 
make a commitment to invest in the maintenance, 
reconstruction, and replacement of our 
nation’s surface transportation infrastructure. 
Many bridges, highways, overpasses, and 
transit facilities are being stretched to the limit 
of their design life and beyond. 

Of the 599,766 bridges in the National 
Bridge Inventory, 25.4 percent of America’s 
bridges—more than one in four—are structurally 
deficient or functionally obsolete. There 
are 72,524 structurally deficient bridges and 
79,792 functionally obsolete bridges. According 
to the Department of Transportation 
(‘‘DOT’’), more than $65 billion could be invested 
immediately in a cost-beneficial way to 
replace or otherwise address existing bridge 
deficiencies. 

Of particular concern is the condition of 
bridges on the 162,000-mile National Highway 
System (‘‘NHS’’), which consists of the 
46,747-mile Interstate System, the Strategic 
Highway Network for military mobilizations, 
and other major highways. While the NHS 
makes up only 4.1 percent of total U.S. mileage, 
it carries 45 percent of vehicle miles traveled. 
NHS bridges carry more than 70 percent 
of all traffic on bridges. Of the 116,172 bridges 
on the NHS, including more than 55,000 Interstate 
System bridges, 6,175 are structurally 
deficient. Almost one-half of these structurally 
deficient NHS bridges are bridges on the Interstate 
Highway System, which has 2,830 structurally 
deficient bridges. The DOT estimates 
the current NHS bridge investment backlog to 
be $32.1 billion, including $19.1 billion for the 
Interstate Highway System bridge backlog. 

While bridges are a key component of our 
nation’s infrastructure network, these figures 
highlight the failure to make necessary investments 
in our nation’s transportation infrastructure 
network. America’s intermodal transportation 
network serves as the backbone of our 
economic security and competitiveness, as 
well as our quality of life. It facilitates the safe 
movement of people and goods, linking our 
communities to each other and to the world. 
The U.S. transportation system has served as 
a model for developing an interconnected network. 
However, in recent years we have been 
losing ground. 

Many aspects of America’s transportation 
network are operating at or near capacity. The 
Texas Transportation Institute, in its 2007 
Urban Mobility Report, reported that in 2005 
wasted fuel and time translated into a total 
congestion cost—or tax on the nation’s drivers—
of $78.2 billion—$5.1 billion higher than 
a year earlier. This congestion translates into 
millions of vehicles stuck idling on American 
roadways. This undermines our nation’s economic 
competitiveness, productivity and quality 
of life. It has also contributed to a significant 
increase in transportation’s share of U.S. 
green-house gas emissions. 

Advances in logistics have turned our nation’s 
roadways into real-time warehouses 

thanks to ‘‘just in time delivery’’, which builds 
greater efficiencies and cost savings into the 
system by allowing businesses to order parts 
and inventory stock in smaller batches. However, 
the increasing congestion on the nation’s 
roadways threatens these efficiency gains. 
Truck transportation has increased its share of 
overall logistics costs for U.S. companies, 
reaching 77 percent of total logistics costs in 
2007. Total logistics costs today account for 

10.1 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic 
Product in 2007, up from 9.9 percent in 2006. 
With our nation’s population expected to 
grow from approximately 300 million today to 
420 million by 2050 and freight volumes expected 
to grow by 70 percent by 2020, future 
demands on our intermodal surface transportation 
network will require a bold new vision 
and approach to addressing the challenges of 
the 21st century, and a commitment to identifying 
the resources to carry out this new vision. 
Yet we continue to underinvest in infrastructure. 


Earlier this year a Congressionally-chartered 
Commission—the National Surface Transportation 
Policy and Revenue Commission—identified 
a significant surface transportation investment 
gap, and called for an annual investment 
level of between $225 and $340 billion— 
by all levels of government and the private 
sector—over the next 50 years to upgrade all 
modes of surface transportation (highways, 
bridges, public transit, freight rail and intercity 
passenger rail) to a state of good repair. The 
current annual capital investment from all 
sources in all modes of transportation is $85 
billion. 

We are now on the threshold of a transformational 
moment in the evolution of our 
surface transportation program. Next year, as 
Congress develops the next surface transportation 
legislation, we will face challenges in 
determining what the shape of our system 
should be and how best to finance it. This new 
era of transportation will challenge our imagination, 
our political will, and the tendency of 
all user groups to hunker down, think and act 
in insular ways—in self-interest, rather than in 
the common interest. We must begin now to 
rise above our differences, to find common 
ground in policies—and funding—that will best 
serve the nation’s passenger and freight mobility 
and access needs in the 21st century. 

Infrastructure is easily overlooked. It is always 
there, always functioning, always serving 
our needs. When infrastructure fails, though, 
as it did that day one year ago in Minneapolis, 
we are suddenly awakened to the fragility of 
our national transportation system. The collapse 
of this facility is a tragedy that policymakers 
and leaders around the country, and 
Americans in general, will not soon forget. The 
traveling public is looking to their government 
for solutions to ensure that such a tragedy will 
not happen again. We must take the lessons 
of the I–35W Bridge, and use them to create 
an accountable and reliable surface transportation 
program that guards the safety of all 
users. 

It will be up to Congress and the next Administration 
to summon the political will necessary 
to create a surface transportation system 
that will serve as an engine of sustainable 
growth, underpinning and enhancing the greatest 
economy in the world, and ensuring the 
safety of American drivers. 

We cannot walk away from this responsibility, 
and we can no longer afford to ignore it. 


E1668 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

INTRODUCTION OF H.R. 1188—THE 
PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS 
RESEARCH, CURE, AND 
CARE ACT OF 2007 

HON. DAVID WU 

OF OREGON 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. WU. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
bring attention to the serious, debilitating, 
chronic diseases of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, 
and to urge you to support H.R. 1188, 
the Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Research, 
Cure, and Care Act for 2007—important bipartisan 
legislation that I have introduced with my 
colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. GERLACH. 

This legislation would be the first ever legislative 
action to fill important gaps in psoriasis 
and psoriatic arthritis data collection and research, 
and is an important step in providing 
relief to the as many as 7.5 million Americans 
that the National Institutes of Health estimates 
suffer from these non-contagious, genetic 
auto-immune diseases. 

Psoriasis is widely misunderstood, minimized, 
and under-treated. In addition to the 
pain, itching, and bleeding caused by psoriasis, 
many affected individuals also experience 
social discrimination and stigma. Of serious 
concern is that people with psoriasis are 
at elevated risk for myriad co-morbidities, including 
but not limited to, heart disease, diabetes, 
obesity, and mental health conditions. 
As such, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis impose 
significant burdens on individuals and 
society; psoriasis alone is estimated to cost 
the nation 56 million hours of lost work and 
between $2 billion and $3 billion annually. 

Also, I wish to take a moment to recognize 
that August is National Psoriasis Awareness 
Month and commend the National Psoriasis 
Foundation, headquartered in my district, for 
its annual efforts surrounding National Psoriasis 
Awareness Month. Moreover, I thank the 
Foundation leaders and staff for working tirelessly 
each day to help our nation make 
progress toward a cure and to ensure that 
people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis 
have access to the care they need and deserve. 


On average, each of us has 17,000 constituents 
with psoriasis. As most of us will be 
at-home frequently this fall, I encourage my 
colleagues to meet with affected constituents, 
learn more about psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, 
and work to reduce the misconceptions 
surrounding these conditions. I further urge 
you to join with me and the other 82 cosponsors 
in supporting people living with psoriasis 
by cosponsoring H.R. 1188.

TRIBUTE TO ERICK JOHNSON 

HON. TOM LATHAM 

OF IOWA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and congratulate Erick Johnson 
of Jefferson Iowa, on his retirement from the 
board of directors of the Hemophilia Federation 
of America. 

The Hemophilia Federation of America is a 
national nonprofit organization that assists and 

advocates for the bleeding disorders community 
and advocates for the removal of all barriers 
to both choice of treatment and quality of 
life. Erick and his wife Jill became involved 
with Hemophilia of Iowa in 1997 after their son 
Skylar was diagnosed with hemophilia. Erick 
became an independent member of the HFA 
board in 2000. He worked with the organization 
to start new programs and increase communication 
with the FDA, CDC and MASAC in 
order to bring HFA’s concerns to the forefront. 

I know that my colleagues in the United 
States Congress will join me in commending 
Erick Johnson for his leadership and dedication 
to representing the Hemophilia Federation 
of America. I consider it an honor to represent 
Erick, his wife Jill, and his son Skylar in the 
United States Congress, and I wish them the 
best in their future endeavors.

MICHELLE’S LAW 

SPEECH OF 

HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
voice my strong support for H.R. 2851, 
Michelle’s Law. This important legislation 
amends the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Public Health 
Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code to 
prohibit a group health plan from terminating 
coverage of a dependent child due to a medically 
necessary leave of absence from a postsecondary 
education institution. 

Madam Speaker, few Americans can simply 
write a check to cover the cost of attending 
college. The average college student graduates 
with alarming amounts of debt, in fact, 
most undergraduate students graduate with 
close to $20,000 in student loan debt. I find it 
unconscionable that, in a time of worsening financial 
burdens, we would also place the burden 
of costs associated with unexpected illness 
on the lives of our young students. 

According to Harvard Medical School, the 
leading cause of bankruptcy in the United 
States is due to unpaid medical bills, most of 
which were filed while the individual or family 
had health insurance. My bill, H.R. 676, the 
United States National Health Insurance Act, 
creates a health care system where there is 
no such thing as medical debt, problems with 
credit, or filing for bankruptcy because of unpaid 
medical bills. Under H.R. 676, financial 
insecurity from fear of indebtedness from medical 
expenses will cease to exist. 

Martin Luther King, Jr. stated that every 
human being requires four things to lead a 
happy and productive life: shelter, employment, 
education, and health. When a person 
has access to the aforementioned four requirements, 
a fifth, justice, holds them all together. 
When a student loses full-time status 
because of an illness and access to 
healthcare, a home and education become 
more difficult to maintain. However, with 
Michelle’s Law, we can provide justice to college 
students and help them retain access to 
care so they can work towards the American 
dream. 

Madam Speaker, instead of making it more 
difficult for the young men and women of our 
nation to achieve higher education, we should 

be doing everything in our power to facilitate 
completion of their courses of study, especially 
when faced with hardships such as debilitating 
physical or mental illness. Please pass 
Michelle’s Law, and help ensure that there is 
one less impediment to education and 
healthcare for our nation’s hardworking college 
students.

IN HONOR OF THE 20TH ANNIVER


SARY OF THE MEGASKILLS PRO


GRAM 

HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE 

OF DELAWARE 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. CASTLE. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise today to recognize 
the MegaSkills program on its program’s 20th 
anniversary. The MegaSkills program helps 
parents and guardians assist their children in 
reaching their academic potential by providing 
a clear road map and guidelines to success. 

The MegaSkills program was created in the 
1988 by Dorothy Rich, a resident of Sussex 
County, DE. The program was started with the 
goal of teaching families how to help their children 
succeed. Based on the idea that family 
involvement is fundamental to learning, the 
program is designed to instruct families on 
how to instill habits and behaviors in their children 
that make up the ‘‘Never-ending Report 
Card’’ which includes confidence, motivation, 
effort, responsibility, caring, teamwork, and 
others. 

When I served as Delaware’s Governor, I 
had the privilege of visiting the town of 
Seaford to honor the teachers, students, and 
families who participated in one of the first 
MegaSkills programs. It was clear even then 
that MegaSkills had tapped into one of the secrets 
of early education: parents and guardians 
who are involved in their child’s education 
at home ensure that they get the best education 
possible in the schools. 

Over the years, the program has proven to 
be highly successful in early childhood education 
and is now used in over 4,000 rural and 
urbn schools across the nation. Recently 
MegaSkills completed a new MegaSkills for 
Babies and Toddlers book to help parents ensure 
their children receive the best education 
possible. Furthermore, the program has been 
applied in various different languages to accommodate 
our diverse population. 

MegaSkills has demonstrated its success in 
increasing time students spend with their parents, 
their motivation on homework, and performance 
on standardized tests and I acknowledge 
and commend the MegaSkills Program 
for 20 years of successful dedication to improving 
education throughout the United 
States. The creators and administrators of this 
program understand what we all need to understand 
in order to improve our education 
system: strong families yield strong students 
with a passion for academic excellence. I am 
confident the MegaSkills program will continue 
to expand and benefit educating families nationwide.

HONORING 100 YEARS OF THE VIS


ITING NURSE SERVICE IN 

SOUTHERN WISCONSIN 

HON. TAMMY BALDWIN 

OF WISCONSIN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Visiting Nurse Service for 
its 100-year commitment to the improvement 
and expansion of patient medical care in 
southern Wisconsin. Since 1908, when the 
Attic Angel Association began working with a 
local nurse to procure in-home care for its 
residents, the Visiting Nurse Service has 
grown to become an integral component of the 
Wisconsin health care industry. As a section 
of the Home Health United health care agency, 
the Visiting Nurse Service now continues 
to facilitate independent living and enhance 
the quality of life for patients across 23 Wisconsin 
counties. By offering patients the option 
to cope with illness and work with medical professionals 
from the comfort of their own 
homes, the Visiting Nurse Service has truly 
enhanced our Nation’s health care system. 

The Visiting Nurse Service that operates in 
Wisconsin originated in Madison as an innovative, 
unique approach to health care. It all 
began when the Attic Angel Association, initially 
founded as a charitable service group, 
perceived a void in the health care system. By 
hiring Maud Reeder, the first visiting nurse in 
the area, Attic Angel found a way to improve 
the scope of existing medical services by initiating 
more convenient, personalized in-home 
care. The Attic Angel Association helped implement 
a change in Wisconsin’s health care 
system that would extend far beyond the 
Madison area. Since its inception, the Visiting 
Nurse Service has operated with the simple 
goals of providing more accessible nursing 
services and offering charitable medical treatment. 


Over the past century, the Visiting Nurse 
Service has enriched the lives of countless 
Wisconsinites. As America’s health care practices 
have evolved and developed during the 
last hundred years, visiting nurses have continued 
to provide a dependable service, acting 
as a valuable constant in an ever-changing 
system. The enduring legacy speaks to the 
Visiting Nurse Service’s remarkable ability to 
provide effective, professional health care and 
to adapt to a growing society. The Visiting 
Nurse Service has demonstrated a genuine 
commitment to addressing the specific, individual 
needs of its patients, and an impressive 
ability to respond to the needs of its community. 


For their commitment to the people of Wisconsin 
and to the enrichment of their community 
through improved medical care, I congratulate 
the Visiting Nurse Service. The 100th 
anniversary of the organization’s inception 
marks a truly extraordinary, well-deserved 
milestone. 

Thank you, Madam Speaker. 

TRIBUTE TO NELSON ELECTRIC 

HON. TOM LATHAM 

OF IOWA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Nelson Electric of Ames, Iowa, 
on celebrating its 100th anniversary and to express 
my appreciation for their commitment to 
providing an important service to Iowans in the 
Central Iowa area. 

In 1908, Ben Nelson left his job at the Ames 
Municipal Power Plant and began his own 
business offering electrical contracting services. 
He contracted his first jobs by going up 
and down Main Street in Ames and building a 
reputation of good service at a fair price. His 
son Chuck joined the crew, and they worked 
together for 40 years, including persevering 
through the Great Depression. Chuck’s sons, 
Paul and Jerry began working at the company 
in the 1960’s and still manage the company 
today. Jerry’s sons, Chris and Matt are now 
the fourth generation of the family to work at 
Nelson. Nelson Electric began working on 
wagons and carts but have kept up on the 
ever changing electric codes and work in the 
commercial/industrial design build sector of 
today, taking on residential and small business 
projects as well. 

I commend Nelson Electric of Ames for providing 
quality and dedicated service to Iowans 
for over 100 years. It is an honor to represent 
the Nelson family and all the members of the 
Nelson Electric crew in the United States Congress, 
and I wish them continued success in 
serving their community.

BOUMEDIENE DECISION 

HON. ELLEN O. TAUSCHER 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mrs. TAUSCHER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
state my strong concern that Congress should 
not take any steps to curtail the recent Supreme 
Court decision in Boumediene et al., v. 
Bush. In a 21 July speech, Attorney General 
Michael Mukasey called on Congress to create 
rules governing treatment of detainees’ petitions 
for habeas corpus instead of simply following 
the rules developed as a result of lower 
court cases. Additionally Justice Department 
officials appearing this week before the Armed 
Services Committee on which I serve have 
called for Congress to step in and help curtail 
the form of the status review process for prisoners. 
Acting on these requests so soon after 
the Supreme Court’s decision and before the 
Federal district courts have had a chance to 
address them is shortsighted and possibly 
damaging to the United States in the long 
term. 

As you know in its 5–4 decision, the Supreme 
Court held that detainees who are 
being held at the U.S. Naval Station in Guantanamo 
Bay, Cuba, are entitled to the habeas 
corpus privilege under the Suspension Clause 
of the U.S. Constitution, meaning that they 
can appeal the justification for their detention 
before a court. The Court also held that Section 
7 of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 
which limited judicial review of executive de


terminations of the detainees’ enemy combatant 
status, did not provide an adequate and 
effective substitute for habeas corpus and 
therefore acted as an unconstitutional suspension 
of the writ of habeas. 

The decision itself was limited both in 
scope. It only applies to detainees held at 
Guantanamo and not elsewhere. The decision 
also does not prevent the administration from 
detaining suspected terrorists or interrogating 
them. It simply confers upon them the basic 
right to know why they have been detained. 

Letting the Federal courts process pending 
habeas petitions is the right thing to do and 
demonstrates to the world that we have confidence 
in our American values and the integrity 
of our legal process. It also will make sure 
that Guantanamo only holds prisoners who 
are threats to the United States and allows us 
to release those who are innocent. 

Among the matters that the courts must 
necessarily address is the credibility of the 
Combatant Status Review Tribunals or 
CSRTs. As you know, the CSRTs were created 
by the Pentagon in response to the 2004 
Hamdi decision to review the determinations 
of enemy combatant status for every detainee 
at Guantanamo. 

While the CSRTs were not the central concern 
of Boumediene, the Court made a number 
of critical observations that I hope the 
lower courts will address for the sake of our 
country’s reputation and because of the 
strength of our values. 

The Court found that the procedural protections 
afforded Guantanamo detainees ‘‘fall well 
short of the procedures and adversarial mechanisms 
that would eliminate the need for habeas 
corpus review.’’ 

The court listed additional deficiencies including 
constraints upon the detainee’s ability 
to find and present evidence at the CSRT 
stage to challenge the government’s case; the 
failure to provide a detainee with assistance of 
counsel; limiting the detainee’s access to government 
records other than those that are unclassified, 
potentially resulting in a detainee 
being unaware of critical allegations relied 
upon by the government to order his detention; 
and the fact that the detainee’s ability to 
confront a witnesses may be more theoretical 
than real given the minimal limitations on the 
admissibility of hearsay evidence. 

The court found that there was ‘‘considerable 
risk of error in the tribunal’s findings of 
fact.’’ And that ‘‘given that the consequence of 
error may be detention for the duration of hostilities 
that may last a generation or more, this 
is a risk too serious to ignore.’’ 

As a Member who is deeply committed to 
ensuring we have the best process to prosecute 
and hold accountable every terrorist and 
release innocent civilians, I have very little 
confidence in the CSRT process that is currently 
in place. 

As the Federal courts begin to process the 
habeas petitions before the government, I 
again urge my colleagues in Congress to not 
chill the process currently underway with the 
narrow legislative solutions the Bush Administration 
is asking for. I ask that we give our civilian 
legal system the time to address the 
new circumstances created by the Supreme 
Court and put in place a successful review 
process that the administration has so far 
failed to do. 


E1670 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

HONORING MR. JOHN GREGORY 
ROVEDA 

HON. BARBARA LEE 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise today with 
my colleague, Representative PETE STARK, to 
honor the extraordinary life of Mr. John Gregory 
Roveda of Alameda, California. A lifelong 
Bay Area resident and significant leader in our 
community, John passed away in his home on 
June 4, 2008. 

Mr. Roveda was born February 19, 1938 in 
Richmond, California. He graduated from the 
esteemed St. Mary’s College High School in 
Berkeley in 1955, and then went on to attend 
the University of San Francisco (USF). There 
he became a founding member of the Gamma 
Omicron chapter of Delta Sigma Pi, International 
Business Fraternity. John was also involved 
in the Army ROTC program at USF. In 
1961, John graduated with a degree in Business 
Administration and went on to attend the 
New York Institute of Finance, where he completed 
coursework in stock exchange and brokerage 
office procedure, and worked as a 
stockbroker. 

Upon returning to the Bay Area, John joined 
his family’s business, United Beverage Distributors, 
Inc., located in Oakland, California. 
His grandfather, Joseph Roveda, founded the 
company in 1933, making John the third generation 
Roveda to become president of the 
family business. 

In 1990 John was admitted to the California 
State Bar and began to practice law in Alameda. 
He periodically served as Judge Pro 
Tempore, and in 1997 was qualified as an attorney 
and counselor of the United States Supreme 
Court. In addition, he was a member of 
the Italian American Bar Association. 

Mr. Roveda was extremely dedicated to his 
community, and to the successful growth of 
the Greater Bay Area. 

He served as president of the Athenian-Nile 
Club as well as the Alameda Boys and Girls 
Club. He was a member of the Design Review 
Board and Planning Board for the city of Alameda 
and a committee member of the Bay 
Area Sports Hall of Fame. Mr. Roveda’s involvement 
spans a long list of other organizations 
including the One-Hundred Club, Alameda 
Elks Lodge, the Rotary Club of Alameda, 
the Porsche Club of America, UNICO, 
and the Oakland Council of the Navy League. 

A true Bay Area resident, Mr. Roveda had 
a lifelong love of the ocean and sailed in the 
Trans Pacific Yacht Race in 1975. He served 
as commodore of the Golden Gate Yacht Club 
and was a member of the Encinal Yacht Club. 
Mr. Roveda also participated in the Newport-
to-Ensenada Yacht Race annually. 

An energetic attorney, businessman, and 
family man, Mr. Roveda had an inexhaustible 
spirit and was widely known for his humor and 
joy for life in our community. Mr. Roveda will 
be sorely missed. However, we are thankful 
for the opportunities he gave us to come together 
and celebrate the hope and love in our 
lives. 

John was a dedicated father, husband, and 
friend to many. Today, California’s 9th and 
13th Congressional Districts salute and honor 
Mr. John Gregory Roveda. We extend our 
deepest condolences to his family, especially 

his wife of 28 years, Judith, his four children, 
Christine, Michelle, Jay, and John, his sons-in-
law Matthew and Andrew, his nephew Stephen, 
and his granddaughters Hayley and 
Evelyn. His legacy will surely carry on through 
the lives of his loving family and friends. May 
his soul rest in peace.

TRIBUTE TO MORNING STAR 
MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH 

HON. RAU´ L M. GRIJALVA 

OF ARIZONA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Morning Star Missionary 
Baptist Church on celebrating 50 years in Tucson, 
AZ. 

Morning Star Missionary Baptist Church was 
founded and organized by the Reverend Charlie 
Hunter, August 1958 in Tucson, Arizona, 
who served in this capacity until the 70s. 

Morning Star became a steadfast church in 
the midst of Tucson’s Southside. Members of 
the Hunter Family and others stood with Reverend 
Hunter including, Everline Hunter, Leroy 
Hunter, Sr., Beulah Hunter, Charles W. 
Hunter, Lorece Hunter, L.B. Hunter, George 
Hunter, Rosie Hunter, Sister Brown, Linnie 
Burns, Reverend and Sister Barnes, Orvie 
Thomas and Florence Hill in establishing the 
church’s foundation. 

In 1978, the church expanded its responsibility 
and established a Head Start center, 
helping to provide a strong foundation for the 
children in the community. 

Over the last 50 years, Morning Star has 
worked to help those in need of counseling, 
resources, support, or the needs of the families 
of the community. 

Morning Star has strived to be more than 
just a church, it has worked hard to make 
itself a community and home; a place where 
people can find help, love, and family in a time 
of need. 

I commend the congregation and leadership 
at Morning Star Missionary Baptist Church for 
their work to ensure the successes over the 
last 50 years. 

Morning Star is a testament to the very best 
in all of us.

CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, 

CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY 

IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 

SPEECH OF 

HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in strong support of the conference report 
agreed to by House and Senate negotiators 
on H.R. 4040, ‘‘The Consumer Product Safety 
Improvement Act of 2008.’’ The final version of 
this Act will institute long-needed reforms to 
the Consumer Product Safety Commission, require 
toys and infant products to be tested before 
they are sold, ban lead and 6 toxins categorized 
as ‘‘phthalates’’ in children’s toys, 
and provide other critical safety improvements. 

This bipartisan and bicameral compromise 
dramatically improves the House version of 
the bill and adopts the vast majority of the provisions 
found in the much stronger Senate bill. 
Such robust provisions are a prudent response 
to the regulatory embarrassment our 
nation suffered in 2007, when almost 30 million 
toys and 15 million child products were recalled 
because of safety concerns. By acting 
today, we will ensure that our nation’s mothers 
and fathers will never have to suffer through 
another year filled with such terror and uncertainty. 


I have long been a supporter of strengthening 
the Consumer Product Safety Commission, 
so that it can finally serve as the first line 
of citizen product safety defense. Over the 
past three months, I have joined with a coalition 
of my fellow Members on two separate 
occasions to advocate for the strong consumer 
protection provisions included in this 
legislation. 

After today, the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission will cease to exist as a ghost regulator; 
starved of the resources, authority, and 
transparency that an effective regulator needs. 
With this bill, this long-running frustration of 
Congressional intent will finally end. 

A vote for this conference report is a vote 
for industry accountability, regulatory integrity, 
and most importantly, child safety. I encourage 
my colleagues to support this conference report.

HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE SAUK COUNTY 
HISTORICAL SOCIETY’S STEWARDSHIP 
OF THE MAN MOUND 

HON. TAMMY BALDWIN 

OF WISCONSIN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Ms. BALDWIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Sauk County Historical Society 
for 100 years of stewardship of the Man 
Mound. Built to resemble a human figure and 
measuring over 200 feet in length, the Man 
Mound is now believed to be our Nation’s only 
remaining Native American effigy mound in 
the shape of a human. The Sauk County Historical 
Society has fought for over a century to 
protect the Man Mound, and the remarkable 
survival of this relic can be largely attributed to 
those efforts. The historical society’s work on 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1671 

behalf of the Man Mound serves as an ideal 
example of its dedication to local communities 
and to the enrichment of society through historical 
preservation. 

The society’s fight to preserve the Man 
Mound began in 1907, only a few years after 

H.E. Cole founded the organization. While surveying 
the Man Mound, Cole discovered that 
the structure would soon be completely demolished 
and then plowed as farmland, like almost 
900 other Native American mounds in 
the area. Cole and the historical society took 
immediate action to save the Man Mound by 
leading a collaborative, community-oriented effort. 
The Sauk County Historical Society, in 
conjunction with the Wisconsin Archaeological 
Society and the Wisconsin Federation of 
Women’s Clubs, raised enough money to purchase 
the Man Mound and protect it from cultivation 
and further destruction. The surrounding 
park was then dedicated in August of 
1908. 
The Sauk County Historical Society’s commitment 
to the stewardship of this landmark 
demonstrates an impressive appreciation of 
the past and of history’s value to modern society. 
The historical society truly recognizes the 
importance of using resources like the Man 
Mound to spread knowledge and educate our 
society. By preserving the Man Mound, the 
Sauk County Historical Society allows us to 
connect with the past and provides us with a 
tangible link to the Native Americans who preceded 
us as stewards of this land. 

Even as we take this opportunity to look 
back in appreciation, the historical society is 
planning ahead for the future of the Man 
Mound and Man Mound Park. With support 
from the Wisconsin Archeological Society, the 
Wisconsin Archeological Survey, the Wisconsin 
Historical Society, the Ho-Chunk Nation, 
and the General Federation of Women’s 
Clubs—Wisconsin, the Sauk County Historical 
Society is initiating a comprehensive study of 
the structure and working to ensure the future 
of this invaluable artifact. 

For their commitment to the people of Wisconsin 
and to the enrichment of their community 
through historical conservation and preservation, 
I congratulate the Sauk County Historical 
Society. The 100th anniversary of the 
society’s stewardship of the Man Mound 
marks a truly remarkable, well-deserved milestone.

THANKING BRADLEY DALE 
MATTAN 

HON. BILL FOSTER 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I am submitting 
this statement to offer gratitude to one 
of my constituents, Mr. Bradley Dale Mattan of 
Geneseo, Illinois. I am very pleased that Mr. 
Mattan has decided to serve as a Peace 
Corps Volunteer in Ecuador. 

The Peace Corps was designed to encourage 
mutual understanding between Americans 
and other cultures of the world. For the past 
47 years over 190,000 Americans have served 
as Peace Corps Volunteers in 139 countries. 

In his statement upon signing the Order that 
established the Peace Corps, President John 

F. Kennedy said, ‘‘Our Peace Corps is not designed 
as an instrument of diplomacy or propaganda 
or ideological conflict. It is designed to 
permit our people to exercise more fully their 
responsibilities in the great common cause of 
world development.’’ I’d like to take this opportunity 
to thank Mr. Mattan for his dedication to 
this responsibility, and for helping to restore 
America’s image in other parts of the world. 
Our country has truly been enriched by the experiences 
of the Peace Corps volunteers. 

I offer my best wishes to Bradley Dale 
Mattan in his endeavors both here and abroad 
and look forward to seeing great work from 
him in the future.

INTRODUCTION OF THE TAKING 

RESPONSIBLE ACTION FOR COM


MUNITY SAFETY ACT 

HON. JAMES L. OBERSTAR 

OF MINNESOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, today I 
join the gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. BEAN, 
and 19 of our colleagues in introducing the 
Taking Responsible Action for Community 
Safety Act. 

The bill will ensure that the Surface Transportation 
Board (‘‘STB’’) has the legal authority 
and policy direction to deal with railroad mergers 
that have the potential to cause serious 
safety, environmental, and other quality of life 
problems for affected communities. 

A recently filed merger application has 
called attention to the need for enhancing the 
authority of the STB. 

The application was filed by the Canadian 
National Railway (‘‘CN’’), seeking the Board’s 
approval to acquire control of the 198-mile 
Elgin, Joliet, and Eastern (‘‘EJ&E’’) rail line. 

Communities affected by the merger have 
alleged serious impacts from the new operations 
which are planned for the merged carrier. 
This acquisition could adversely impact 
more than 40 communities along the EJ&E 
line, and result in rail traffic increases of 15 to 
24 trains per day. For example, in Barrington, 
Illinois, the number of freight trains will increase 
from 5 to 20. In Plainfield, Illinois, the 
CN train total will reach 42 per day. 

The communities impacted by the proposed 
acquisition have raised significant concerns related 
to public safety, grade crossing safety, 
hazardous materials transportation safety, 
noise, and economic job loss. For example, 
the EJ&F line includes 133 grade level crossings 
that intersect with existing roadways. Increased 
traffic on the line may not only adversely 
impact motorist safety but emergency 
response time and vehicle access, a growing 
concern for many communities across the nation. 


Under current law, the STB has very limited 
power to consider these concerns. The STB is 
now required to approve all mergers and consolidations 
between a Class I railroad (such as 
CN) and a Class II railroad (such as EJ&E) 
unless the Board finds that the merge is likely 
to cause a substantial lessening of competition, 
create a monopoly, or restrain trade in 
freight surface transportation in any region of 
the United States; and that the anticompetitive 
effects of the transaction outweigh the public 
interest in meeting significant transportation 
needs. 

The STB does have authority to impose 
conditions to address community concerns on 
any approval of a merger between a Class I 
railroad and Class II railroad. However, the 
STB has decided to significantly limit the types 
of conditions it will impose. Under its regulations, 
the STB will not impose conditions that 
may ‘‘undermine or defeat’’ a transaction, 
even if those conditions are critical to ensuring 
the safety and health of communities. 

The bill we are introducing today will enable 
the STB to thoroughly consider the public interest 
when evaluating a proposed railroad 
merger or consolidation which includes at 
least one Class I railroad. 

Specifically, the bill requires the STB to consider, 
in a merger or consolidation proceeding, 
the safety and environmental effects of the 
proposed transaction, including the effects on 
local communities, such as public safety, 
grade crossing safety, hazardous materials 
transportation safety, emergency response 
time, noise, and socioeconomic impacts. It 
also requires the STB to consider the effects 
of the proposed transaction on intercity passenger 
rail and commuter rail. 

The bill prohibits the STB from approving or 
authorizing a merger or consolidation if it finds 
that the transaction is inconsistent with the 
public interest because the transaction’s impacts 
on safety and on the affected communities 
outweigh the transaction’s transportation 
benefits. Further, the bill authorizes the STB to 
impose conditions to mitigate the effects of the 
transaction on local communities when such 
conditions are in the public interest. 

With these new powers and policy directives, 
the STB will have greatly enhanced ability 
to protect local communities against the adverse 
effects of rail mergers. I urge my colleagues 
to support this important legislation.

EXTENDING MY DEEPEST GRATITUDE 
TO NOON ROTARY CLUB 
OF MUNCIE, INDIANA, A DEDICATED 
GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS 
WHO WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY 
TO HELP HOOSIERS IN NEED 

HON. MIKE PENCE 

OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise to thank 
the Noon Rotary Club of Muncie, Indiana for 
their invaluable service to the residents of my 
hometown of Columbus, Indiana following catastrophic 
flooding that city experienced in 
early June. 

An article published in the Columbus Republic 
on July 25, 2008 outlined the tremendous 
support this group provided: 

Three Saturdays ago, carloads of Muncie 
Rotarians descended on Eastside Community 
Center, determined to help prepare and deliver 
meals to survivors and volunteers. 

They’ve been coming back ever since. 

‘‘This Muncie group is awesome,’’ said Celeste 
Racette, a member of the Columbus 
Sunrise Rotary Club who worked with the 
Delaware County group in coordinating the 
volunteer effort. ‘‘They not only helped prepare 
and deliver meals but they have kept 
coming back and they even set the folks at 
Eastside up with Gleaner’s Food Bank out of 
Indianapolis to deliver a week’s supply of 
food.’’ 

They’ll need it. Lenore Hollowell, who is 
coordinating the meal delivery program 


E1672 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

Eastside initiated in the early hours of the 
flood recovery, said Thursday that the group 
is averaging 550 meal deliveries each day. 

The article continues: 

The Muncie group offered more than just 
helping hands. 

The Rotarians who arrived on the first 
Saturday and immediately were sent to devastated 
areas with prepared meals were welcomed 
warmly but also given guidance for 
future visits. 

‘‘If people didn’t want the lunches, they 
definitely wanted the water,’’ Celeste said. 
‘‘That need was discovered on their first trip. 
On the next trip the Muncie group brought 
down 40 cases of water, four coolers and endless 
bags of ice so that we could hand out 
cold bottled water along with the meals.’’ 

While the Muncie group was in Columbus, 
one of its members struck up a conversation 
with Lenore Hollowell about additional 
sources of food. 

Gleaner’s Food Bank in Indianapolis was 
mentioned and within the space of hours, e-
mails were being traded back and forth setting 
up the delivery of a week’s supplies. 

‘‘The delivery ran the gamut from eight 
cases of yams to two cases of mop handles 
. . . from three cases of chocolate chip cookies 
to four pallets of bottled water . . . there 
were even 1,200 prepared meals from Federal 
Emergency Management Agency.’’ 

The Noon Rotary Club of Muncie will likely 
make their final visit to Columbus on August 2. 
I want to extend my deepest gratitude to this 
dedicated group of volunteers who went out of 
their way to help Hoosiers in need.

KENDRICK PERKINS 

HON. TED POE 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, today I am 
proud to pay tribute to Kendrick Perkins, the 
former basketball standout at Clifton J. Ozen 
High school and the starting Center for the 
2007–2008 NBA Champion Boston Celtics. 

Kendrick was born in Nederland, Texas, in 
1984. According to his grandmother, he 
played football and baseball as a young boy 
but would fall asleep at night holding a basketball. 
He attended Our Mother of Mercy Catholic 
School throughout elementary school and 
was one of the tallest altar boys they have 
ever seen. So tall, in fact, that they had to 
have a robe specially made for him. He continued 
to serve the church until his high school 
graduation, even while scouts and agents 
were vying for his services. 

Perkins attended Ozen High School in 
Beaumont, Texas and left quite a legacy on 
the basketball court. He led the team to three 
Class 4A Sate Championship games in three 
years, winning the title as a sophomore in 
2001. During that run, his Panthers were a 
combined 111-4. As a senior, the 6-foot-10 
Kendrick averaged 27 points, 16 rebounds, 
and almost 8 blocked shots per game, easily 
making him one of the nation’s top high school 
prospects. 

After graduating from high school in 2003, a 
number of elite colleges recruited him and he 
was considered by some to be the best high 
school center in America. He was ranked 

alongside LeBron James as the nation’s top 
recruits, but so far advanced was his game 
that he spent that summer traveling to tryouts 
with a number of NBA teams. He was drafted 
in the first round of the NBA Draft with the 
27th overall pick by the Memphis Grizzlies and 
immediately traded to the Boston Celtics, one 
of the most successful franchises in all sports. 

Kendrick played a support role as the 
team’s ‘‘enforcer’’ during his first few years in 
the league, earning a reputation as one of the 
tougher players on the team. He would eventually 
work his way up the depth chart to starting 
center. In 2007, the team made a number 
of off-season moves that would leave the Celtics 
as the favorite to win the title. The team 
had the best record in the league during the 
regular season and had home court advantage 
throughout the playoffs. 

The playoffs were more difficult than they 
would have hoped. Their first two series both 
went to seven games but they were able to 
pull through. Kendrick and the Celtics beat 
former prep-rival LeBron James and his 
Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference 
Finals to bring the Celtics to their first 
NBA Finals appearance since the 1985–86 
season. Their opponents were the Los Angeles 
Lakers, facing each other in the Finals for 
a record 11th time. There was genuine buzz 
and excitement around the NBA for the first 
time in recent memory and Kendrick would 
have a chance to shine. 

The first few games saw the Celtics dominate 
the series at home. The Lakers were 
able to win one when they returned to their 
home court and had a chance to win Game 4 
before the Celtics made the biggest comeback 
in NBA Finals history to win the game. Perkins 
injured his shoulder and sat out Game 5. He 
was doubtful for Game 6 but showed the 
toughness that has come to define him and 
played through the pain to help the Celtics win 
their 17th overall championship. Perkins averaged 
6 points and 6 rebounds to lead his 
team to the 2007–08 NBA Championship. 

On behalf of the Second Congressional District 
of Texas, I applaud Kendrick Perkins on 
his outstanding achievements. He has been 
successful on and off the court, and I applaud 
his dedication to his community and to his 
team. 

And that’s just the way it is.

THROUGH THE COMMISSIONER

WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN 
THE RIO GRANDE BASIN, AND TO 
APPROVE THE SETTLEMENT OF 
THE WATER RIGHTS CLAIMS OF 
THE PUEBLOS OF NAMBE, 
POJOAQUE, SAN ILDEFONSO, 
TESUQUE, AND TAOS 

HON. TOM UDALL 

OF NEW MEXICO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Today I rise to 
introduce a bill to complete two major tribal 
water settlements in northern New Mexico, the 

Aamodt and Abeyta settlements. Introduction 
of this bill represents a major milestone in the 
completion of these important settlements. 
Years of work and negotiation have gone into 
each of these, and I am pleased that the 
tribes, villages, cities, counties, acequias, and 
community groups involved were able to come 
to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. 

New Mexico is a state rich with tradition and 
culture, where the water resources are scarce 
and precious. As is common in most of the 
arid west, this vital but limited commodity can 
foster conflict between communities and individuals, 
and in a state where the history is 
long and complex, disputes over water are 
equally complicated. But, despite the complications 
surrounding water tenure, New 
Mexicans are united in a common respect for 
this resource. From the pueblos and tribes of 
New Mexico, to the historic acequias and 
growing communities, water is fundamental to 
both survival and cultural traditions, and is respected 
as such. Both the Aamodt and Abeyta 
settlements are examples of communities and 
tribes coming together to resolve their differences 
and find a way to ensure that everyone 
has access to this precious and respected 
resource. 

The bill being introduced today consists of 
two titles, the first outlining the Aamodt Settlement, 
and the second outlining the Abeyta 
Settlement. 

The Aamodt title resolves the water claims 
of the Pueblos of Nambe, Pojoaque, San 
Ildefonso, and Tesuque, and the needs of the 
surrounding communities in Santa Fe County. 
The settlement is a result of long negotiations 
between the county and pueblos, and will result 
in the development of a mutually beneficial 
water infrastructure system. This system 
will ensure that the pueblos and surrounding 
communities have access to clean running 
water into the future. I applaud the efforts and 
success of these groups in coming to an 
agreement that both settles disputes and benefits 
each community. 

The Abeyta title establishes the water 
claims of the Pueblo of Taos, the Taos Valley 
Acequia Association, the Village of El Prado, 
and the Town of Taos. These communities depend 
heavily on agriculture and irrigation for 
both traditional practices and subsistence. The 
settlement ensures water for both agricultural 
and domestic use, and facilitates the rehabilitation 
of irrigation infrastructure. Additionally, 
the Abeyta settlement helps to protect the 
quality of water in the watershed by protecting 
and recharging the wetlands areas of the Taos 
Pueblo’s buffalo pasture. After years of negotiation, 
the parties involved in this important 
settlement have come to an agreement based 
on respect of cultural practices, and a commitment 
to live as good neighbors sharing a common 
resource. 

It has been said that the wars of the future 
will be fought over access to water. In New 
Mexico, we are setting a different precedent— 
a precedent of respect and compromise, one 
that will help us move into the future with well 
established partnerships and a commitment to 
conserve and manage this vital resource to 
the benefit of all. I am honored to introduce 
this legislation today that will bring the pueblos 
and communities involved in the Aamodt and 
Abeyta one step closer to establishing a secure 
water future. 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1673 

INTRODUCING THE STUDENT 
VOTER OPPORTUNITY TO ENCOURAGE 
REGISTRATION (STUDENT 
VOTER) ACT OF 2008 

HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce the Student Voter Opportunity 
To Encourage Registration Act of 2008, 
along with my colleague Representative STEVEN 
LATOURETTE. The foundation of America’s 
democracy lies in broad participation and civic 
engagement. From the Civil Rights Amendments, 
to women’s suffrage, to the abolition of 
the poll tax and finally the ratification of the 
Twenty-Sixth Amendment, this nation has embarked 
on a difficult but steady march toward 
becoming a more inclusive nation. 

I believe that the Student VOTER Act is a 
continuation of that progress, because it provides 
a pathway to participation for America’s 
youth. 

The need for this bipartisan bill is clear. Despite 
a small rise in youth voting in the 2004 
presidential election, young voters are far less 
likely to vote than older voters. In the 2004 
presidential election, only 47 percent of 18–24 
year old citizens voted, compared to 66 percent 
of citizens 25 and older. This marked the 
eighth straight presidential contest in which 
less than half of young Americans voted. 

While there are a number of factors that 
contribute to this trend, one is clearly the fact 
many college students are first-time voters 
and often are unfamiliar with how to register. 
In some states, including my own state of Illinois, 
first-time voters must register in person 
in order to cast an absentee ballot. For students 
who attend college outside of their 
home state or who do not have access to 
transportation, those requirements present a 
tremendous burden that is costly and difficult 
to overcome. 

The Student VOTER Act offers a straightforward 
solution: it requires colleges and universities 
that receive federal funds to register 
students. The Student VOTER Act does this 
by amending the National Voter Registration 
Act of 1993 to designate colleges and universities 
that receive federal funds as voter registration 
agencies. 

This legislation will not present a substantial 
burden to our Nation’s universities. In fact, 
many are already providing this service for 
students. For example, even before orientation 
begins, Brown University in Rhode Island provides 
its students with voter registration materials 
not only for Rhode Island, but also for 
each student’s home state. 

Unfortunately, too many colleges and universities 
have failed to follow Brown’s lead. I 
am introducing this legislation today to spur 
more universities to make registration widely 
available to America’s youngest voters. 

I would also like to thank my friend Matthew 
Segal, the Executive Director of the Student 
Association for Voter Empowerment. This bill 
would not exist today were it not for his dedication 
to enhancing voter access for America’s 
youth. 

I urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor this 
important legislation.

DIANA STATE CHAMPIONS 

´ 

HON. ANDRE CARSON 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to congratulate the Decatur Central High 
School baseball team. The Hawks were 
crowned Division 4A Indiana State Baseball 
Champions on June 14, 2008 at Indianapolis’s 
Victory Field. Decatur Central captured the 
state title with a 7–3 victory over Fort Wayne’s 
Homestead High School. 

The boys worked tirelessly throughout the 
season and compiled an overall record of 29– 

7. This is the first state championship for a 
Decatur Central team. 
This year’s team was led by seniors Harmon 
Cooper, Zack Deakin, Anthony Eldridge, 
Adam Kirk, Shawn Mattingly, Jeff Pace, and 
Isaac Pruitt. Other members of the team include 
juniors Jake Gharst, Aaron Gregory, Andrew 
Kinnaird, Nate Kress, Pat Sharpe, Kenny 
Rackley, Nick Stoia, Taylor Tijerina and sophomores 
Eric Howell, Brent Ledford, Shane 
Muse, Ronnie Shelton, Austin Sprinkle and 
Zach Weldon. Top performers this year included 
Nick Stoia, who set a school record for 
runs batted in and Andrew Kinnaird, who set 
a school record for doubles. 

This team’s achievements would not have 
been possible without the support of their 
coaches and school officials. Head Coach Phil 
Webster, in his 23rd season of coaching at 
Decatur Central, and his staff served as excellent 
teachers and mentors to the young men 
they were charged with coaching. Additionally, 
all the Decatur Central fans, and in particular 
the always energetic student body, should be 
recognized for their enthusiasm and pride in 
their team. 

The 2008 Decatur Central baseball team 
has secured a place in the storied history of 
Indiana high school sports. I offer my congratulations 
to the members of the team, the 
coaching staff, the school, and the greater Indianapolis 
community on their accomplishments 
throughout the season.

THE DEFINITION OF HONESTY, INTEGRITY 
AND HONOR: CHAIRMAN 
CHARLES B. RANGEL AND 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 

HON. CAROLYN C. KILPATRICK 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Ms. KILPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
unequivocal, unapologetic, and unwavering 
support of one of the finest individuals who set 
the standard for statesmanship, excellence 
and principle in the U.S. House of Representatives, 
none other than the gentleman from 
the 15th Congressional District of New York, 
one of the founders of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, Chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee, Congressman 
CHARLES B. RANGEL. Congressman RANGEL, 
whom I am proud to count as not only one of 
my Congressional mentors, but also as a personal 
friend, has to take time from his schedule 
of, among other things, ensuring that all 
children have access to health care, ensuring 
that cigarettes are regulated, and that Congress 
figures out a way to pay for the education 
of the women and men who are fighting 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, to defend himself 
against a charge levied in a newspaper that 
questions his very integrity, dignity and honor. 

I was unavoidably detained, and I did not 
vote on this motion. If I had been present, I 
would have voted ‘‘aye’’ in favor of the motion 
to table. 

It is without a single scintilla of doubt these 
charges against the Chairman, charges registered 
by Chairman RANGEL himself with the 
House Ethics Committee, will arrive at one 
conclusion—the conclusion of innocence. 
Chairman RANGEL’s record of almost four decades 
of service, of dedication, of devotion not 
only to his constituents, but of the integrity of 
the institution of Congress, has earned him 
the right to a fast and fair examination and I 
would add exoneration of these charges. 
Chairman RANGEL, along with my fellow Michigan 
colleague JOHN CONYERS, JR., is the remaining 
founders of the Congressional Black 
Caucus who serve with us today. For the remainder 
of the 110th Congress, Chairman 
RANGEL will have my personal support and assistance 
as he wages what will be a victorious 
fight against these charges. 

What describes Chairman RANGEL? Here 
are a few: outstanding attorney. One of the 
finest politicians in the history of New York. 
Civil rights worker. Founder of the most influential 
political organization in the history of 
Congress. The first African American Chairman 
of the powerful Ways and Means Committee. 
Husband. Father. Colleague. And finally, 
friend. 

As I continue to pray for Chairman RANGEL’s 
continued good health, prosperity and fortune, 
I look forward to a fair and expeditious consideration 
of these charges by the House Ethics 
Committee. Chairman RANGEL’s importance to 
this body, as the leader of the Ways and 


E1674 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

Means Committee, is far, far too valuable to 
both Congress and the nation to waste toward 
dilatory efforts to ruin his good name and 
bring him down. I know that, based upon the 
merit of the case, that the Chairman will be 
exonerated, the Chairman’s innocence will 
prevail, and he will continue to handle the 
people’s business in the manner that has 
brought honor, dignity and respect to the U.S. 
House of Representatives.

TRIBUTE TO BURT RUTAN 

HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. MCCARTHY of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Elbert Leander 
‘‘Burt’’ Rutan, a renowned aerospace engineer, 
who celebrated his 65th birthday on 
June 17, 2008. 

Burt was born in Portland, Oregon, on June 
17, 1943, though he was raised in Dinuba, 
California. As a young boy, Burt produced 
award-winning model airplane designs; a prodigy 
in the making. When Burt was sixteen, he 
obtained his pilot’s license and went on to receive 
his aeronautical engineering degree 
from California Polytechnic State University, 
San Luis Obispo. Soon after, the United 
States Air Force hired Burt as a civilian flight 
test engineer at Edwards Air Force Base in 
California. 

Throughout the years, Burt has established 
himself as a leader in innovative aircraft design. 
With the start of his own private company, 
Rutan Aircraft Factory, based in Mojave, 
California, Burt began to market sleek, light, 
and efficient aircraft such as the VariEze, 
Quickie, and the Long-EZ; it was during this 
time that the concept for the Voyager was 
generated. Burt’s passion for aeronautical engineering 
soon found him leading Scaled 
Composites, the world’s most productive aerospace 
prototype development company. Some 
of the most innovative and successful aircraft 

developed by Scaled Composites have been 
the Triumph jet for Beechcraft, the CM–44 
UAV for California Microwave, the Scarab 
Model 324 drone for Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical, 
and the McDonnell Douglas DC–X 
single stage rocket structure. His designs utilized 
lightweight composite materials, rendering 
him with copious amounts of success 
and praise for his entrepreneurial skills and insightful 
knowledge on the subject to which he 
has dedicated his life. 

One of Burt’s most famous designs, the 
Voyager aircraft, piloted by Burt’s brother, Dick 
Rutan, set a record-breaking flight around the 
world without stopping to refuel in 1981. Model 
218 Proteus, a tandem-wing high-endurance 
aircraft designed by Burt, holds several altitude 
records. SpaceShipOne gained Burt significant 
recognition as it was the first privately-
built, funded, and flown aircraft to enter space 
in June of 2004. This feat was acknowledged 
with the Ansari X Prize, while his team was 
honored with the 2004 Collier Trophy later that 
year, awarded to them by the National Aeronautic 
Association. 

Today, SpaceShipOne, Burt and his team’s 
spacecraft that launched men successfully into 
space, is displayed in the Smithsonian National 
Air and Space Museum’s ‘‘Milestones of 
Flight’’ gallery in Washington D.C. Other prestigious 
awards given in recognition of Burt’s 
aerospace expertise include the Chrysler 
Award for Innovation in Design, the British 
Gold Medal for Aeronautics, ‘‘Engineer of the 
Year’’ by Design News, the Presidential Citizens 
Medal presented by President Ronald 
Reagan, and the Lindbergh Award. 

As Burt has soared through his creative and 
competitive career, he has been commended 
for his innovative efforts. His maverick aerospace 
expertise continues to be highly sought 
after. Today, Burt and his company, Scaled 
Composites, are currently engineering 
SpaceShipTwo for Virgin Galactic with the 
prospect of offering suborbital trips into space 
by 2009. Burt has never given up on his 
dreams and he continues ‘‘looking up, way 
up.’’

REMARKS ON THE OLYMPIC 
JOURNEY OF LEONEL MANZANO 

HON. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, a son of 
Burnett County, Texas is going to the Olympics. 
I rise today to congratulate Leonel 
Manzano on his outstanding achievement in 
making the U.S. Olympic Track and Field 
Team. 

It seems Leonel was born to be an Olympian. 
His work ethic is legendary, his character 
is impeccable, and he can just flat out run. His 
dedication to his sport has earned him a spot 
to compete on the biggest stage in athletics 
and prove to everyone that a young man from 
a small corner of Texas can be the best in the 
world. It will be a joy to watch him represent 
my district, the State of Texas, and our entire 
country. 

As Leonel travels to Beijing, he will go with 
the hope and prayers of the entire Texas Hill 
Country with him. His neighbors, family, 
coaches, and even competitors have all 

helped forge him into the man he has become 
and we will all be watching in rapt attention 
when he steps into the blocks. 

If I could remind Leonel of just two virtues 
that bring success, it would be to always fulfill 
your God given talents and never forget to be 
gracious under pressure. If he can manage 
these two feats, as he has done so well in the 
past, he will return home an Olympic hero. 

It is my honor to represent Leonel, as well 
as his parents, Jesus and Maria Manzano, 
here in Washington. I share their pride in all 
that Leonel has accomplished. As he heads to 
Beijing, I wish him good luck and safe travels.

A TRIBUTE TO THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
OF MEDICAL MINORITY 
EDUCATORS, INC. 33RD ANNUAL 
CONFERENCE—SEPTEMBER 
17–21, 2008 

HON. G. K. BUTTERFIELD 

OF NORTH CAROLINA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, it is 
my great honor today to rise and recognize 
the National Association of Medical Minority 
Educators, Inc., also known as NAMME, for 
their years of support for health professionals 
from traditionally underrepresented and disadvantaged 
populations. 

Established in 1975, NAMME aims to increase 
the presence of minority health care 
providers. To achieve this goal, the founding 
members of NAMME have worked tirelessly 
over the years to provide motivated students 
with access to education, training, and practice 
in the health care profession. 

Since its inception, NAMME has strived to 
prepare students for success in health related 
fields including dentistry, optometry, public 
health, and veterinary medicine. The organization 
holds as its core values its ability to develop 
and sustain productive relationships and 
to produce action oriented programming for 
stakeholders. NAMME has established an extraordinary 
reputation of providing exceptional 
professional development opportunities for its 
members. NAMME is hopeful that these significant 
opportunities will ultimately translate to 
the reduction in health disparities among underserved 
populations. Madam Speaker, I 
commend NAMME for its vision and foresight 
in identifying this service which is so greatly 
needed in disadvantaged communities. 

Today, with alumni across the country, 
NAMME stands as one of the leading organizations 
for providing the type of training and 
informational resources that will greatly benefit 
small communities. Programs are available 
that nurture and support individuals through all 
stages in their pursuit of a career in health 
care. 

NAMME will hold its 33rd Annual Conference 
in Arlington, Virginia on September 
17–21, 2008 where House Majority Whip, The 
Honorable JAMES E. CLYBURN will serves as 
the keynote presenter. 

Madam Speaker and Distinguished Colleagues, 
I hope that you will join me today in 
honoring NAMME and the substantial contributions 
this organization has made to provide 
access to health care education for underrepresented 
and disadvantaged communities. 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1675 

IN HONOR OF THE BEN DAVIS 

BOYS’ TRACK AND FIELD TEAM, 

2008 INDIANA STATE CHAMPIONS 

´ 

HON. ANDRE CARSON 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. CARSON or Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to offer my congratulations to the 
Ben Davis boys’ track and field team. The Giants 
were crowned Indiana state track and 
field champions on May 31, 2008 at Indiana 
University in Bloomington, Indiana. 

This is the first time that the Ben Davis 
boys’ track and field team has captured the 
state championship although they have been 
state runner-up in 2000, 2002 and 2007. With 
this victory Ben Davis athletic teams have 
compiled one of Indiana’s most impressive 
records, winning a total of 22 state championships 
since 1962. 

This year’s team was led by a strong class 
of 23 seniors. Rapheal Williams and LaVarus 
Williams, along with juniors Colin Hester and 
Matthew Terrell gave an impressive team performance 
at the championship meet by taking 
first place in the 4x100 meter relay. Matthew 
Terrell also achieved individual success, finishing 
first in the 200 meter dash and securing 
his place as the 2008 Ben Davis Varsity 
Points Leader. 

This team’s achievements would not have 
been possible without the support of a wide 
variety of coaches and school officials. Head 
Coach Mike Davidson, in his 17th season of 
coaching at Ben Davis, and his assistant 
coaching staff provided the players with guidance 
both on and off the track. Additionally, all 
the Ben Davis fans, and in particular the always 
energetic student body, should be recognized 
for their enthusiasm and pride in the 
team. 

Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in offering 
congratulations to the members of the 
team, the coaching staff, the school, and the 
greater Indianapolis community on their accomplishments 
throughout the season.

TO HONOR WILLIAM ANTHONY 
CARGILE 

HON. NICK LAMPSON 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. LAMPSON. Madam Speaker, I am honored 
to stand here today to praise the distinguished 
service of Mr. William Anthony 
Cargile. Through his service as a Volunteer 
Firefighter in the Santa Fe Fire and Rescue, 
he has distinguished himself from his colleagues 
in a variety of ways. At the age of 14, 
Anthony (as he is known to his friends and 
colleagues) started his volunteer firefighting 
career as a junior fireman. Thirty years later 
he continues to serve his community not only 
as a volunteer firefighter but in a number of 
other roles as well. 

Anthony’s firefighting credentials are impressive. 
He holds an Advanced Firefighter Certification 
as well as a Level II Instructor’s Certification 
from the State Fireman’s and Fire Marshal’s 
Association of Texas. Along with serving 
as President of the Gulf Coast Firemen’s 

Association from 1999 to 2000, he has served 
as the Training Commissioner for the Galveston 
Firefighter’s Association from 2001– 
2003 and Coordinator of the Galveston County 
Field Day in 2003. 

A fitting example of Anthony’s character was 
his effort to establish an Honor Guard for the 
Santa Fe Fire and Rescue. Anthony did all the 
necessary research, received approval from 
his superiors and even designed and assembled 
the uniforms. Because of his tireless endeavor, 
he was able to successfully assemble 
the Honor Guard in 2004, which has performed 
admirably in a number of ceremonies. 
As another sign of Anthony’s service to the 
firefighting community, he has received Fireman 
of the Year from the Santa Fe Fire and 
Rescue twice, in both 2000 and 2007, and 
was chosen as the Firefighter of the Year in 
2008 by the State Firemen’s and Fire Marshal’s 
Association of Texas. 

Consequently, it is not surprising that he 
was nominated for National Firefighter of the 
Year, an award given by the National Volunteer 
Fire Council. 

Anthony is a model citizen and a true public 
servant. His actions have distinguished him in 
his community and the 22nd District of Texas 
is proud of its son.

IN RECOGNITION OF STEVE 
THOMPSON 

HON. JIM COSTA 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to the distinguished public service 
of Steve Thompson. After more than 30 years 
with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, he is 
retiring on August 2nd. 

Steve Thompson served as the Director of 
the Service’s California and Nevada Region. 
In this post he oversaw Service programs in 
California, Nevada and Klamath Basin that administered 
the Endangered Species Act and 
Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and managed 51 
national wildlife refuges, and three national 
fish hatcheries. 

Prior to coming to Sacramento, Thompson 
was based in Atlanta as the Regional Chief for 
the National Wildlife Refuge System in the 
Service’s Southeast Region. Prior to serving in 
Atlanta, he spent three years as the Branch 
Chief for Resource Management for the National 
Wildlife Refuge System Headquarters in 
Washington, DC 

Thompson began his career with the Service 
as a wildlife biologist at Malheur National 
Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon, moving on 
to the Puget Sound National Wildlife Refuge in 
Olympia, Washington, and Stillwater National 
Wildlife Refuge in Fallon, Nevada, before becoming 
refuge manager at Laguna Atacosa 
National Wildlife Refuge in Rio Hondo, Texas. 

In 1994 Thompson was chosen as the first 
‘‘Refuge Manager of the Year’’ by the National 
Audubon Society and the National Wildlife 
Refuge Association. In September 2007, he 
earned the Distinguished Executive Award, the 
highest Presidential Rank Award given to career 
Senior Executive Service employees. 

Thompson, was born in Nevada and raised 
in both Nevada and California, where he graduated 
in 1976 from Humboldt State University 

with a bachelor of science degree in wildlife 
management. He is a competitive swimmer, 
avid birdwatcher and hunter. 

Throughout his career at the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, Mr. Steve Thompson has 
been well known for his balanced, common 
sense approach. His partnership philosophy 
and demonstrated ability to work with diverse 
stakeholders will be missed. As he embarks 
on a new chapter in his life, I wish him continued 
success and good luck in all his future endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO DICK RUTAN 

HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. MCCARTHY of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Richard Glenn 
‘‘Dick’’ Rutan, an aerospace pioneer, as he 
celebrated his 70th birthday on July 1, 2008. 

Dick was born in Loma Linda, California, on 
July 1, 1938. At a young age, Dick developed 
an avid interest in piloting. By the time he 
turned 16, Dick was earning both his driver’s 
license and pilot certificate. Dick has always 
had a passionate thirst for learning, thereby 
leading him to join the Air Force Aviation 
Cadet Program at the age of 19 and later receiving 
a commission as a Lieutenant. Dick 
went on to obtain a Bachelor of Science Degree 
at the American Technological University 
through the Air Force Professional Education 
‘‘Boot Strap’’ Program. 

When the Vietnam War broke out, Dick established 
himself as a brave, highly competent, 
and rigorous leader. As a Tactical Air 
Command fighter pilot, Dick flew 324 combat 
missions, 105 of which were as a high-risk 
classified operation known as the MISTY’s. 
The many achievements Dick accomplished 
while serving in the Air Force merited him the 
Silver Star, five Distinguished Flying Crosses, 
16 Air Medals, and the Purple Heart. 

After Dick’s retirement, he joined forces with 
his brother, Burt Rutan, as the Production 
Manager and Chief Test Pilot for Rutan Aircraft 
Factory. He is widely recognized for his 
successes involving the world speed and distance 
records set in the Long–EZ, an airplane 
designed by Burt. To honor Dick’s many 
achievements in record-setting flights, he was 
awarded the prestigious Louis Bleriot Medal 
by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale. 

In 1981, Dick expanded his wings even further 
to found Voyager Aircraft, Incorporated 
and settle in the history books by completing 
the first-ever around-the-world, non-stop, non-
refueled flight. Nine days, three minutes and 
forty-four seconds after Dick and his copilot 
Jeana Yeager took off, he landed at Edwards 
Air Force Base in California. The plane he piloted 
in this successful quest is now suspended 
in the Smithsonian National Air and 
Space Museum’s ‘‘Milestones of Flight’’ gallery 
in Washington, D.C. President Ronald Reagan 
awarded Dick and his team with the Presidential 
Citizens Medal, four days after the 
team’s outstanding feat. 

Time and time again, Dick has delved into 
projects that allow him to expound upon his 
knowledge and share his expertise and adventures 
with others. These have included a 
sightseeing airplane trek to the North Pole, the 


E1676 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

World Quest Project, and the Spirit of EAA 
Friendship World Tour. He established the 
Dick Rutan Scholarship Fund to assist youth 
in furthering their education and is actively involved 
in the Experimental Aircraft Association’s 
Science, Math and Technology (S-M-T) 
program. 

Today, Dick continues his quest of traveling 
the world by educating others through the accounts 
of his many adventures. He exudes 
dedicated passion, courage of conviction, and 
wisdom and he exemplifies the true marks of 
leadership. His distinguished achievements 
have gained him renowned recognition and respect, 
and I am pleased to wish him a happy 
birthday!

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the winners and all the 
participants in the 71st annual All-American 
Soap Box Derby World Championship at 
Derby Downs in Akron, Ohio, on July 26, 
2008. 

A record 609 contestants from forty three 
states and three foreign countries competed at 
the legendary Derby Downs for the title of 
Champion. This race is held annually at Derby 

Downs, which was created in 1936 by the 
Works Progress Administration (WPA) after 
Akron city leaders realized that a permanent 
track for the race was necessary. The racers, 
all between the ages of eight and seventeen, 
compete in six different divisions. All of the 
cars are powered only by gravity and built by 
the racers. The racers can reach speeds of 
thirty miles an hour and the races usually last 
less than thirty seconds and are decided by 
mere hundredths of seconds. 

I am pleased to note that Elizabeth Underwood, 
17, of Barberton, placed 3rd in the Masters 
division, Joe Puntal, 14, of Youngstown 
placed 3rd in the Super Stock division, and 
Johanna Barnowski, 11, of Cuyahoga Falls 
placed 1st in the Stock division. 

Other Akron area racers who participated 
were Katie Atchison, Brett Chrisman, Dustin 
Chrisman, Emily Harmon, Tyler Shoff, Sarah 
Smith, Dennis VanFossen Jr., Cheyenne Wilt 
and Mary-Kate Wilt. Racers from the Youngstown 
area included Zachary Krohn of 
Austintown, Johanna Kuebler of Berlin Center, 
Julia Castner of Hubbard, Jenn Rodway of 
Boardman, and Jamie Berndt of Canfield. 

I congratulate all the winners on their extraordinary

IN RECOGNITION OF COLMA CITY 
MANAGER DIANE McGRATH 

HON. JACKIE SPEIER 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to pay tribute this evening to a dedicated public 
servant, Diane McGrath, the City Manager 
of the Town of Colma. 

Diane retires next month, capping a 36 year 
career in municipal government, which began 
in Breckenridge, Colorado. She moved to California 
in 1985 to serve Foster City as Deputy 
Executive Director of the Community Development 
Agency. After seventeen years in that 
post, she was hired by Colma as Deputy City 
Manager and impressed the City Council 
enough to be promoted, two years later, to 
City Manager. 

During her tenure, Ms. McGrath and her 
staff oversaw the design and construction of a 
state-of-the-art public safety facility and community 
center, completed the reconstruction 
and beautification of Junipero Serra Boulevard 
and remodeled the Town Hall Council Chamber 
and rotunda. Most impressive is that all 
these projects were accomplished in an era of 
ever-tightening municipal budgets. 

Ms. McGrath is a member of the International 
City Management Association and 
was President of Municipal Management Assistants 
of Northern California. She received a 
Bachelor of Arts degree from California State 
University, Long Beach and a Master of Arts 
from the University of Colorado. 

Madam Speaker, Diane McGrath is a role 
model to anyone who aspires to a career in 
government. She handles her professional responsibilities 
with the unflappable grace that 
only the mother of 6 children and grandmother 
of 4 can pull off. A renaissance woman, Diane 
is a brilliant conversation partner, whether the 
subject is ballet, politics or Cal football. 

While I wish Diane McGrath could continue 
in her job forever, she has earned her retire


ment. Along with husband Fred Biagini, she 
will travel the world and spend more time with 
her large family. In addition, I am confident 
that she will continue to be a dynamic force in 
her community for many years to come.

HOLLYWOOD CONSERVATISM 

HON. JOE WILSON 

OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to submit the following 
article published in The Washington Times 
newspaper on July 23, 2008. It outlines the 
prevalence of conservatism among actors and 
leaders in the film and entertainment industry. 
Moreover, it is encouraging to learn that support 
for our troops and traditional values are 
shared by Americans from all walks of life. 

HOLLYWOOD’S CONSERVATIVE UNDERGROUND 
(By Amy Fagan) 
A group of politically conservative and 
centrist Hollywood figures organized by 
actor Gary Sinise and others has been meeting 
quietly in restaurants and private 
homes, forming a loose-knit network of entertainers 
who share common beliefs like 
supporting U.S. troops and traditional American 
values. 
Some of those involved are taking more 
public steps to counter the entertainment industry’s 
tilt toward liberalism and Democratic 
politics, such as campaigning for Republican 
Sen. John McCain or crafting 
projects to portray America in a more positive 
light. 
The group, whose members call themselves 
‘‘Friends of Abe’’ after Abraham Lincoln, 
was organized as an underground movement 
because of fears that prominent industry titans 
with outspoken liberal views would retaliate, 
said participants. They often were 
reluctant to name members of the group in 
interviews for fear it would hurt their careers. 
‘‘It’s a growing movement, and word is getting 
out that there’s many of us in this business 
. . .,’’ said 1950s singer Pat Boone, one 
of the few conservatives to talk about the 
movement publicly. ‘‘If certain studio 
execs—hirers and firers—learn that this is a 
movement and growing, and that some of 
these people that they hire are of this inclination, 
these people could be unemployed.’’ 
Friends of Abe has functioned like a support 
group, organizing informal gatherings 
where actors, producers, screenwriters, key 
grips and other industry types can share 
common values or discuss concerns like anti-


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1677 

Americanism in Hollywood movies or the 
perception of industry bias against conservatives 
and Republicans. 

The movement has grown over the past few 
years from gatherings of a few dozen to one 
last month that drew more than 600 to a billionaire’s 
California estate, Mr. Boone said. 

People familiar with the movement credited 
Mr. Sinise, whose roles range from the 
blockbuster movie ‘‘Forrest Gump’’ to the 
TV show ‘‘CSI: New York’’ for helping organize 
the movement. 

Sinise spokeswoman Staci Wolfe said the 
actor was traveling with a band to entertain 

U.S. troops overseas and was unavailable for 
an interview. She would say only: ‘‘He is not 
registered with any political party.’’ 
Participants said Friends of Abe is not partisan, 
but rather functions as a support 
group where Republicans, Democrats and 
independents alike can discuss issues they 
care about. And the low-key gatherings at 
restaurants and homes have given conservatives 
a safe place to meet and express their 
views, they added. 

‘‘A Friend of Abe is someone who has reverence 
for those who serve in our military 
and believes that American liberal democracy 
is a unique success, different from others, 
and it’s worthy of the respect of our popular 
culture...of Hollywood in particular,’’ 
said screenwriter Lionel Chetwynd, 
who helped organize Friends of Abe luncheons 
when they began 4 years ago. 

Mr. Chetwynd said Friends of Abe generally 
find themselves at odds with the rhetoric 
of their hard-left colleagues in Hollywood. 


Craig Haffner, a producer who also attended 
the gatherings, said Friends of Abe is 
‘‘not a political action group; people are 
gravitating to it because they love their 
country.’’ 

While the group is not organizing any political 
activities, some of its members are 
taking action into their own hands. 

Actor Jon Voight, Mr. Boone, Mr. 
Chetwynd and Mr. Haffner have stepped forward 
and actively campaigned for Mr. 
McCain’s presidential bid. Mr. Boone said he 
talked to McCain campaign staffers last 
week about how he and other stars can help. 
Supporters now are assembling a formal organization 
for Mr. McCain in Hollywood, a 
few of the leaders said. 

Meanwhile, many want to produce more 
movie and theater projects with a positive 
American message and stronger emphasis on 
positive cultural values instead of films that 
paint America as ‘‘the great Satan,’’ Mr. 
Boone said. Mr. Chetwynd said such efforts 
have been under way for several years, well 
before the Friends of Abe luncheons began. 

Actor Kelsey Grammer, a Republican, is 
aware of the group but won’t comment further, 
his publicist said. 

David Horowitz, another Hollywood conservative 
and founder of the Los Angeles-
based Center for the Study of Popular Culture, 
said the group is serving a good purpose 
but he worries its members won’t be aggressive 
enough. 

‘‘There’s a kind of . . . intellectual terror 
in this town. People are terrorized; they’re 
afraid to say what they think. So what Gary 
is doing to provide aid and comfort to its victims 
is admirable, and I applaud him for it,’’ 
he said. ‘‘But my concern is it’s not going to 
be much more than that.’’ 

THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘‘MID


WEST SCHOOLS DISASTER RE


LIEF ACT’’ 

HON. PHIL HARE 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. HARE. Madam Speaker, the Midwest 
has been hard-hit by record flooding in recent 
months, disrupting the lives of the farmers, 
homeowners, and families of my Illinois Congressional 
District. Flood damage to schools 
alone is expected to reach nearly $100 million, 
and as a result some schools will not open in 
the fall. Those schools able to open their 
doors are desperately trying to get ready for 
the upcoming school year, but repairs and 
cleanup are ongoing. 

Moreover, many schools will see an influx of 
flood-displaced students, while others will face 
financial challenges due to the loss of students 
and property values where the schools 
are located. I have heard from several regional 
superintendents in my district, particularly 
Mr. Ralph Grimm of West Central Community 
Unit School District No. 235 in Henderson 
County, with concerns that this situation 
will make it difficult for them to make ends 
meet in the coming school year. 

To address short- and long-term needs, immediate 
education disaster assistance for 
flood-impacted schools is necessary to ensure 
that students continue to receive a quality 
education in the aftermath of this disaster. As 
such, I proudly introduce the Midwest Schools 
Disaster Relief Act. 

Similarly to the assistance Congress approved 
after Hurricane Katrina, this bill would: 

Authorize funds to restart school operations. 
These monies could be used on transportation 
assistance, to replace damaged textbooks and 
computers, rent temporary classroom sites, 
hire additional staff for counseling services, 
clean up school buildings, and other services 
and activities. 

Authorize funds for schools to accommodate 
any displaced students they enroll. 

Prohibit the loss of students due to displacement 
to count against schools when Federal 
funding is calculated for the next academic 
year. 

Waive the Federal requirement that schools 
maintain their share of financial responsibility 
in providing education services. 

Ensure the needs of homeless students displaced 
by flooding are met through the Education 
for Homeless Youth program. 

The natural disasters of May and June 2008 
have adversely affected the economy, agriculture, 
critical infrastructure, and school districts 
of the Midwest. As weather-damaged 
schools prepare to welcome students back in 
just a few short weeks, we simply cannot 
stand by and watch our children receive a 
lower-quality education solely because they 
live in an area where flooding or storms occurred. 


Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in supporting this legislation. 

WORLD WAR II MARINE 
GRADUATES HIGH SCHOOL 

HON. TED POE 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, James DeLeon 
is one this year’s 2008 high school graduates. 
The difference is he is 83 years old. 

He was born in Goliad, Texas, and when 
World War II broke out he dropped out of 
Ganado High School, lied about his age and 
joined the U.S. Marine Corps. His 16-year-old 
brother, Charlie, did the same thing a few 
weeks later. 

James was part of the 6,000 Marines sent 
into battle at Guadalcanal in the South Pacific 
in 1942. There, they seized the island’s airport 
and never relinquished it. He was also in the 
invasion of Okinawa—the site of one of the 
fiercest battles of World War II—where he remained 
until the end of the war. He had 
served 34 months in the Marine Corps. 

Then, James returned to Texas and married 
his sweetheart, Susie Marie Elizondo; raised 
seven children and worked for 36 years at the 
Port Arthur, Texas, Texaco refining plant. Recently, 
his daughter Theresa located a lost letter 
from the Marines to Ganado High School 
dated 1947 stating that DeLeon met all the requirements 
to earn his diploma. She mailed it 
to the current principal and James was then 
honored with his own graduation ceremony. 

James DeLeon is yet another successful 
member of the Greatest Generation that answered 
America’s call in time of need. 

And that’s just the way it is.

THE DAILY 45: MIGUEL LEON-
FREGOSO 

HON. BOBBY L. RUSH 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, everyday, 45 
people, on average, are fatally shot in the 
United States. 

I have another story of unnecessary violence. 
This time the location is in the city of 
San Diego. According to reports, 27-year-old 
Miguel Leon-Fregoso was with a group of 
friends at a bar early this morning when, upon 
leaving, he was involved in a verbal altercation 
outside. Minutes later a man shot Miguel in 
the face. Thus, in yet another quick, mindless 
instance—another young life has been taken. 

Americans of conscience must come together 
to stop the senseless death of ‘‘The 
Daily 45.’’ When will Americans say ‘‘enough 
is enough, stop the killing!’’

REMARKS IN RECOGNITION OF 
BARRY WEISS 

HON. JACKIE SPEIER 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to draw the attention of Congress to the passionate 
work and unparalleled leadership of 
Barry Weiss, who is retiring as Director of 
Parks and Recreation for the City of San Carlos. 


Under Barry’s leadership, his department received 
more than two dozen state and local 
awards for facility design, park planning, economic 
development and programming. Barry, 
himself, is the recipient of numerous honors, 
including the Statewide Citation Award, Presidential 
Award and Achievement Award from 
the California Park and Recreation Society, 
Distinguished Alumni Award from California 
State University at Hayward and Outstanding 
Youth Sports Leader from the National Alliance 
for Youth Sports. 

Barry Weiss served as President of the California 
Park and Recreation Society in 2004– 
2005, where he shared his knowledge and expertise 
with others in his field on park planning 
and encouraging community involvement. Attesting 
to his success as a parks and recreation 
administrator, Barry is a highly sought-
after lecturer on the subject, being invited to 
share his knowledge with professionals in Arizona, 
Washington, Michigan and all across 
California. 

Barry received his Bachelors Degree in 
Recreation and a Lifetime Teaching Credential 
in Social Science from California State University, 
Hayward. He is also a graduate of the 
Pacific Revenue Sources Management School 
in San Diego, and the Inter-Governmental 
Management Training Program, based in St. 
Helena, California. 

Madam Speaker, Barry Weiss is truly an innovator. 
He developed the first Parks Master 
Plan for San Carlos, built the first disabled-inclusive 
playground in San Mateo County with 
70 percent of features being accessible to children 
of all abilities and limitations, and was 
among the first to document the societal gains 
attributed to park construction and recreation 
programs. Some of these benefits to society 

include increased property values, reduced juvenile 
crime, increased academic performance 
and increased sales by downtown businesses. 

Along with the citizens of San Carlos, I am 
disappointed to see Barry go, but I am grateful 
for his service, his dedication to his community 
and the positive impact he has made on society.

DON L. HANNI, JR. REMEMBERED 

HON. TIM RYAN 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay respect and tribute to Attorney 
Don L. ‘‘Bull Moose’’ Hanni, Jr., who passed 
away July 16 at the age of 82. 

A lifelong resident of the Mahoning Valley, 
Don Hanni was born August 25, 1925 on the 
East Side of Youngstown. A graduate of East 
High School, he received his bachelor’s degree 
in social studies and history and his law 
degree from Youngstown College. Hanni was 
a U.S. Army veteran of World War II, having 
served in the Normandy invasion. 

A prominent figure in the community, Hanni 
was known for his career in law as a defense 
trial lawyer, also serving as a municipal judge 
and as an assistant city prosecutor. A member 
of the Mahoning County Bar Association, 
Hanni was a powerful political force, serving 
as Chairman of the Mahoning County Democratic 
Party for 16 years. 

A much respected and admired man, Hanni 
dedicated his life to the devotion and service 
of others and will long be remembered. 

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that an article from The Vindicator of July 17, 
2008 be included in the RECORD. 

RECALLING SKILL, WIT OF HANNI 
(By William K. Alcorn) 
YOUNGSTOWN.—Attorney Don L. Hanni Jr., 
who defined some of the best and worst in 
Youngstown law and politics during a career 
that spanned more than a half-century, died 
at his Coitsville home Wednesday morning. 
As a lawyer, Hanni had a reputation as an 
accomplished student of the law and as a 
courtroom brawler who was faster on his feet 
than almost any opponent. As a politician, 
his own success at the ballot box was mixed, 
but as a Democratic Party chairman he 
made and broke more political careers than 
any chairman before him—or likely any that 
will follow him. 
Friends and adversaries, sometimes one 
person being both, depending on the circumstances, 
talked about Hanni, 82, the lawyer, 
the politician and the man. 
He was nicknamed ‘‘Bullmoose’’ by Julaine 
Gilmartin, the wife of his good friend Atty. 
Vincent Gilmartin. Mrs. Gilmartin said 
Hanni reminded her of a character, ‘‘General 
Bullmoose, in the ‘‘Li’l Abner’’ cartoon, who 
was always telling everybody what to do, she 
said with a laugh. 
‘‘He always had the greatest stories. We’re 
losing all the curmudgeons. It’s the end of an 
era,’’ she said. 
‘‘We were very dear friends,’’ said Gilmartin, 
who had an office in the same building 
as Hanni at 219 W. Boardman St., after his 
16-year stint as county prosecutor. 
‘‘He was a very honorable sort of person, 
very straightforward, very alert and kind-
hearted,’’ he added. 
Gilmartin said he and Hanni faced each 
other numerous times as prosecutor and de


fense attorney. ‘‘I found him to be very well-
prepared, always knowledgeable about what 
we were doing, and aware of what the law required. 
He was a very good attorney,’’ Gil-
martin said. 

One of Hanni’s fiercest political foes over 
the years was William Binning, who was 
chairman of the Mahoning County Republican 
Party at the same time Hanni was head 
of the county Democratic Party. 

Binning said sometimes their relationship 
was friendly, but they often were bitter enemies 
and had nasty fights. 

‘‘It depended on the issue of the day,’’ said 
Binning, professor emeritus at Youngstown 
State University and former chairman of the 
school’s political science department. 

‘‘One thing I would say, his word was always 
good with me. I had great respect for 
him because of that. He was one of the great 
colorful figures of the Mahoning Valley, and 
his passing is a great loss to the Valley,’’ 
Binning said. 

Another political foe with whom Hanni 
locked horns was Attorney Michael Morley, 
who replaced Hanni as county Democratic 
Party chairman in 1994. 

‘‘While Don and I had our political differences, 
we maintained a civil and cordial 
relationship over the years. I offer my condolences 
to his family. I visited him in the 
nursing home a couple of weeks ago and 
wished him well. 

‘‘We would see each other at events and he 
would call me chairman and I would call him 
chairman, and occasionally we would share a 
story,’’ Morley said. 

‘‘Don Hanni and I were close friends. We 
used to have lunch on Fridays together and 
have a drink or two together,’’ said R. Scott 
Krichbaum, a Mahoning County Common 
Pleas Court judge and a former defense lawyer. 


‘‘But he and I battled, too. We were great 
adversaries at one point. He was Democratic 
Party chairman and I was the Republican 
candidate for judge. We had to send the sheriff 
up to secure the ballots once the voting 
was done. It was a very close race,’’ Judge 
Krichbaum said. 

On the other hand, however, the judge said 
Hanni was ‘‘probably as good a trial lawyer 
as this area ever produced. He was absolutely 
brilliant in cross-examination. He was much 
more concerned with the facts than with the 
law. His method was very effective. He could 
pretty much take any case and give the defendant 
the best defense available. 

‘‘We respected each other as trial lawyers. 
It causes me a great deal of sorrow that I’ve 
lost him as a friend and as a colleague. His 
death is a tremendous loss to his family and 
the community,’’ Judge Krichbaum said. 

Former Senator Harry Meshel’s relationship 
with Hanni went back to pre-college 
days when they used to frequent the Ritz Bar 
on Wilson Avenue on the East Side. They 
were both World War II veterans—Hanni in 
Europe and Meshel in the Pacific. 

‘‘We used to argue about who won the 
war,’’ Meshel said with a laugh. 

They were at Youngstown College and on 
its student council at the same time. Despite 
that relationship, they quarreled about politics 
from time to time. ‘‘He never hesitated 
to argue, even with his friends, and even 
ruled against them in court,’’ Meshel said. 

‘‘The last time I visited him, not too many 
days ago, he was screaming about politics. 
He said, ‘You got to run for mayor.’ I said, ‘I 
will if you’ll be my law director,’’’ Meshel 
said. 

‘‘I think people would remember him for 
his sense of humor and sense of purpose, and 
his skill as a lawyer. He was highly respected 
in the legal profession. The judges will tell 
you he was prepared and clients got their 
money’s worth,’’ Meshel said. 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1679 

‘‘He was one of a kind. People don’t know 
the things he did,’’ said Joyce Kale Pesta, 
deputy director of Mahoning County Board 
of Elections and a longtime Hanni associate. 

When he found out people who lived in the 
old Pick Ohio Hotel had no place to eat in 
downtown Youngstown, he fed them out of 
his office on Boardman Street. ‘‘Sometimes 
he would cook and sometimes I would cook,’’ 
Pesta said. 

‘‘He always said ‘Don’t kick anybody when 
they’re down, because you never know when 
you’ll be down.’ Even his worst enemies he’d 
stick up for when they were down. That’s 
how [former county sheriff and U.S. Representative 
James] Traficant and he became 
friends after being enemies for many years,’’ 
she said. He served in the Army during World 
War II and was with the Allied Forces who 
landed on Normandy beach on D-Day on 
June 6, 1944. He said it was horrific, but he 
never talked about it much, Pesta said. 

The Rev. Lonnie Simon, pastor emeritus of 
New Bethel Baptist Church on Hillman 
Street, said Hanni was ‘‘Mr. Democrat in 
Youngstown as far as I was concerned.’’ 

‘‘He was very well-liked in the black community, 
and I got along with him well,’’ said 
the Rev. Mr. Simon, who, when he came to 
Youngstown in 1946, registered as a Republican. 


Hanni was a mentor for Attorney Alan R. 
Kretzer in his early days and a client in a 
high-profile case when Hanni ran his car into 
the post office building in downtown Youngstown 
in 1985. Hanni was charged with driving 
under the influence; however, it was dismissed 
because of lack of evidence, but a 
charge of reckless operation was allowed to 
stand. 

Kretzer said Hanni took that case and all 
cases seriously, but always had a sense of 
humor. 

When they were considering how the case 
might go, Kretzer said Hanni told him that if 
he had to spend a few days in jail, at least he 
wouldn’t have to listen to his telephone ring 
all day long. 

Other local lawyers and government officials 
remembered Hanni as a widely respected 
giant in local legal and political circles. 


Kathi McNabb Welsh, chief deputy 
Mahoning County clerk of courts, remembered 
well her days as an assistant county 
prosecutor in the 1990 murder trial of Christopher 
W. Magourias, who was defended by 
Hanni and Attorney J. Gerald Ingram and 
acquitted in the stabbing death of Kenmore 
Drake. 

‘‘It was quite a legal education for me to 
watch his mastery of the rules of evidence 
and his control of the courtroom,’’ she said 
of Hanni. 

‘‘He will best be remembered as a great 
lawyer, a very zealous litigator, a person 
who really went out of his way to advocate 
his client’s position and did a wonderful job 
of that,’’ said Attorney Vincent Wloch, a 
magistrate in Mahoning County Probate 
Court. 

‘‘There was nobody better here locally 
with regard to cross-examination. He 
thought quick on his feet,’’ said Wloch, who 
shared an office with Hanni from 1979 to 1985. 

Wloch said he learned a great deal from his 
experience as co-counsel with Hanni in the 
defense of Steven T. Masters, whose 1980 
murder trial lasted 10 weeks. Masters was 
convicted of killing his wife, Jodi, in what 
was then the longest criminal trial in 
Mahoning County history. 

‘‘He was just a Democratic giant in our 
field of politics,’’ said Lisa Antonini, 
Mahoning County treasurer and Democratic 
Party chairwoman. Hanni’s humor and ability 
to ‘‘get a message out on Democratic 
Party politics’’ will be missed, she said. 

‘‘What a historian. We’ll miss him for that. 
He always taught me that you have to understand 
your history to move forward into the 
future. He never shied away from calling me 
when he thought I needed a history lesson,’’ 
she recalled.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF THE 
HONORABLE ARTHUR GAMBLE, JR. 

HON. JO BONNER 

OF ALABAMA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. BONNER. Madam Speaker, the State of 
Alabama recently lost a man who made a profound 
impact on our State and Nation, and I 
rise today to honor the memory of Judge Arthur 
‘‘Bud’’ Gamble, Jr. 

History will remember Judge Gamble as the 
district attorney who prosecuted Ku Klux 
Klansman Collie Leroy Wilkins for the 1965 
murder of Viola Liuzzo, a civil rights worker 
from Detroit who was gunned down in her car 
following the Selma-to-Montgomery voting 
rights march. Judge Gamble’s memorable 
closing argument to the all-white jury led to a 
hung jury and the eventual federal conviction 
of the Klansman. Judge Gamble’s contributions 
to the Civil Rights movement, his 23 
years of service as circuit judge for Lowndes, 
Crenshaw, and Butler counties, and his dedicated 
service in World War II demonstrated he 
was a true American patriot. 

Born on February 9, 1920, in Greenville, 
Alabama, Judge Gamble joined the Navy during 
World War II and flew patrol planes in the 
South Pacific. After the war, he returned to the 
University of Alabama and earned a Juris 
Doctor. He began practicing in his hometown 
and met Roberta Anne Peacock, whom he 
married in 1949. His love of law led him to 
serve in the Alabama Senate during the 
1950s. He ran unopposed as the chief prosecutor 
in the circuit and served two terms. 

Miraculously, Judge Gamble survived an assassination 
attempt in 1975 when his car was 
bombed. He retired almost two decades later 
in 1992, with much respect from the citizens of 
the three counties he had served for almost a 
quarter of a century. 

Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in remembering a dedicated judge, community 
leader, and friend to many, as well as 
a wonderful husband and father. Judge Gamble 
will be dearly missed by his family—his 
wife, Roberta Gamble and their daughter, 
Reverend Eugenia Gamble—as well as the 
many countless friends he leaves behind. 

Our thoughts and prayers are with them all 
during this difficult time.

MAURINE GRAY 

HON. TED POE 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, today I am 
proud to honor the lifetime of service given by 
Maurine Gray, longtime director of the Beaumont, 
Texas, Library. She spent almost 40 
years serving the city and helped turn their 
public library system into one of the best in 
the State. 

Enid Maurine Gray was born in Galveston, 
Texas, in 1943. An only child, she moved to 
Beaumont before her third birthday so her father 
could work as a family physician at a 
local refinery. After her high school graduation, 
she continued her education and received her 
BA from Northeast Louisiana State College 
and her Master’s Degree in library science 
from North Texas State University. 

She returned to Beaumont in 1966 to head 
the city’s then fledgling library system. At the 
time, there were two libraries. Under her vision, 
the City of Beaumont established an additional 
four libraries, including a new main Library. 
Maurine was employed by the City of 
Beaumont from 1966 until her retirement in 
November of 2006. Never one to rest, she 
was hired back after retirement as a part-time 
consultant on projects including the expansion 
of Terrell Historical Library. 

Numerous professional accolades were 
awarded to Maurine throughout her life. She 
was elected the secretary/treasurer of the 
American Library Association in 1972 during 
their annual convention. North Texas State 
named her a Distinguished Alumnus in 1980. 
In 1992, the Texas Municipal League named 
her the Library Director of the Year. She also 
received the Athena Award in 2005, which is 
presented to a woman for her professional 
achievements. 

Maurine was the Library Director but she 
also wore many other hats. She worked with 
United Way, the Humane Society, the Beaumont 
Rotary Club where she once served as 
President, the Beaumont Civic Opera, and the 
Beaumont Heritage Society, to name a few. 
She was affiliated with the Texas Municipal Librarians 
Association, Junior Roundtable of 
Texas Library Association, and was a member 
of the Texas State Library Advisory Council. 

Enid Maurine Gray passed away on June 
21, 2008. 

On behalf of the Second Congressional District 
of Texas, I applaud Maurine Gray on her 
lifetime of dedication and service to the community. 
She has made Southeast Texas a better 
place to live.

TRIBUTE TO KATHERINE AND 
ELIZABETH GANT 

HON. DENNIS MOORE 

OF KANSAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. MOORE of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Katherine and Elizabeth 
Gant, residents of Kansas’ Third Congressional 
District, who are retiring after 46 
years as music educators in Leawood, Kansas. 


In anticipation of a celebration honoring the 
Gant sisters that will take place on August 10, 
the Sun newspapers of Johnson County recently 
published an article detailing their accomplishments 
and plans for the future, which 
I am including with this CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD statement. Having spent a lifetime 
composing children’s music and teaching 
music to children, they will now focus on composing 
and promoting their own compositions. 

Madam Speaker, I know that all House 
members join with us in paying tribute to Katherine 
and Elizabeth Gant, who are beloved by 
several generations of Johnson Countians for 
their dedicated and selfless work to bring 
music into the lives of our children. 

GANT SISTERS STOP TEACHING TO FOCUS ON 

RECORDING 

(By Kelli Bamforth) 

After 46 years as music educators to countless 
children across the metro area, Elizabeth 
and Katherine Gant are hanging up 
their hats after the sale of their Leawood 
music school, 3658 W. 95th St. 

But do not expect the sisters to retire. In 
many ways, their work is just beginning. 

Elizabeth and Katherine will now focus on 
composing and promoting their original children’s 
music beyond Kansas City. 

‘‘Schools and churches use our music but 
we knew we had to start aggressively marketing 
our music to get it out of Kansas 
City,’’ Elizabeth said. ‘‘We want to get it all 
over America, but knew we couldn’t teach 
and market simultaneously.’’ 

The sisters sold their school two months 
ago to Cindy See, a pianist with two daughters 
who are former students of the Gants. 

‘‘With the See family, (the school) will 
continue to be a family affair,’’ Elizabeth 
said. ‘‘They just finished their summer session 
and will start back up in the fall.’’ 

A celebration honoring the Gant sisters 
will be held from 2 to 5 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 10, 
at Hallbrook Country Club, 11150 Overbrook 
Road. 

Leawood Mayor Peggy Dunn will present a 
proclamation declaring ‘‘Gant Sisters Day’’ 
in the city and a children’s choir will perform 
with school alumni. 

‘‘It all fell into place,’’ Katherine said. ‘‘I 
thought (declaring Gant Sisters Day) was so 
sweet. Politicians and big important people 
get things named after them all the time, 
but for two sister educators. . .they keep 
telling us there are other things planned, but 
it’s a surprise.’’ 

The sisters began what they call a ‘‘lifelong 
love affair with music’’ when their 
mother inspired them as children. 

‘‘She taught us to sing with harmony,’’ 
Elizabeth said. ‘‘She was a working mother 
but we never felt neglected.’’ 

Elizabeth and Katherine attended the Cincinnati 
Conservatory of Music, where they 
majored in opera and education. When Katherine 
graduated a year ahead of Elizabeth, 
Archie Jones, dean of the Conservatory of 
Music at the University of Missouri-Kansas 
City, asked Katherine to create a new and 
different children’s music education program. 


Elizabeth and Katherine began writing 
their own children’s music and lyrics when 
they could not find anything suitable for 
children age 3 to 6 in their program. 

‘‘We started writing music to fit the needs 
of our classes,’’ Elizabeth said. ‘‘We saw the 
need and we always loved children. We like 
to think we have our finger on the pulse of 
today’s children, the dreams they dream. 
Our mom always told us the most important 
people in the world are children. 

‘‘We decided to write music for the child in 
all of us.’’ 

The program eventually moved to the 
Avila University campus for 10 years before 
being relocated to Leawood’s Ranch Mart 
shopping center. 

The sisters have recorded CDs and cassette 
tapes of their music, and eventually began 
writing children’s books, adaptations of classic 
fairy tales such as ‘‘Pinocchio’’ and ‘‘Little 
Red Riding Hood.’’ 

‘‘We write our own original music for each 
character,’’ Elizabeth said. 

One recording that already has reached audiences 
across the country is ‘‘America, I 
Love You!’’ Katherine and Elizabeth re-recorded 
the children’s national anthem after 
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 

‘‘That Sunday after 9/11, Katherine and I 
were at home watching television and Itzhak 
Perlman, a very talented violinist, was performing 
in New York near the site,’’ Elizabeth 
said. ‘‘After he was done, he didn’t 
know the camera was still on him, and he 
just started weeping. And it touched 
us. . .we knew we had to do something for 
the children.’’ 

Eleven years prior to Sept. 11, the sisters 
wrote and released the patriotic song, but re-
recorded the tune with more than 400 children 
on the Pembroke Hill School campus. 
All proceeds from the recording go to two 
charities in New York for children whose 
parents lost their lives. 

The video and CD have been distributed to 
all five branches of the military and every 
public television station in America. 

But the music school remained their passion, 
the sisters said. 

Business mostly came from word of mouth, 
Elizabeth said, and the sisters routinely 
taught children and grandchildren of former 
students. 

‘‘We’ve had a beautiful response to our 
music from children and parents alike,’’ 
Elizabeth said. ‘‘When you put music and 
children together, beautiful things can happen. 
We’ve always had the feeling in our 
hearts that children and music should come 
together to bring about peace in the world.’’ 

Elizabeth and Katherine, both widowers, 
live together. Katherine said the past 46 
years have been ‘‘a dream world of a perfect 
job.’’ 

‘‘It’s our passion,’’ Katherine said. 

‘‘This wasn’t just a whim or a passing 
fancy,’’ Elizabeth said. ‘‘Music is like food, 
an ongoing necessity the world will always 
need. We’re not trying to launch a rocket 
from a canoe but from the flagship of everything 
we’ve built for 46 years.’’ 

RECOGNIZING THE CEDAR STREET 

CAPITAL IMPROMEMENT PROJ-

ECT OF DENTON, TEXAS 

HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Cedar Street Capital 
Improvement Project in Denton, Texas. August 
20, 2007 marked the beginning of this needed 
project. 

The project was funded by Community Development 
Block Grants, or CDBGs, which 
were allocated to the City of Denton by the 

U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
These important Federal funds have 
been well utilized to benefit the people of the 
26th District of Texas. 
For more than 20 years, the City of Denton 
has set aside CDBG funds to repair and replace 
public facilities and services in older 
neighborhoods. The projects are designed to 
enhance both pedestrian and vehicle access 
to neighborhoods and downtown and to support 
basic services such as water and sewer. 

The Cedar Street project replaced all water 
and sewer lines, many of which were over 50 
years old. The project also widened sidewalks, 
making them ADA accessible for the first time 
in history. Roadside trees, benches, bike 
racks, and pedestrian amenities were also 
added. The estimated cost for the project is 
$1.2 million, of which $800,000 came from 
Community Development Block Grants. This 
project will help enhance mobility and aesthetics 
as well as upgrade utility lines on the 
west side of the Downtown Square. 

Madam Speaker, it is an honor to rise today 
and recognize the outstanding improvements 
being made on Cedar Street, and I thank the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development 
for allocating the funds to make it possible. 
It is my privilege to represent the members 
of the Community Development Advisory 
Committee and everyone involved in these 
worthwhile projects in the 26th District of 
Texas.

CALLING ON CHINA TO END 

HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES PRIOR 

TO THE OLYMPICS 

SPEECH OF 

HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
express my concerns with H. Res. 1370. 

I certainly am supportive of many of the provisions 
of the bill. I am a friend of His Holiness 
the Dalai Lama, and I continue to voice my 
displeasure of the treatment of the Tibetan 
people by the government of the People’s Republic 
of China. The human rights consequences 
that persist in Tibet have the potential 
to devastate Tibet and completely abolish 
any chance of peaceful reconciliation. 

I also support efforts to hold repressive governments 
in Sudan and Burma accountable for 
their reprehensible treatment of their citizens. 
It is outrageous that these governments continue 
to prosper and enjoy support from other 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1681 

governments, such as China, as they systematically 
dismantle the economic and physical 
security of their citizens and routinely violate 
universally accepted human rights principles. 

However, this legislation continues a troubling 
pattern of addressing political and social 
issues in a cosmetic and superficial manner, 
while ignoring the devastating impact of our 
trade policies with China on the American 
economy and American families. The Economic 
Policy Institute recently released a report 
that asserted between 2001–2007, our 
trade deficit with China has more than tripled, 
from $84 billion to $262 billion. This trade deficit 
has lead to a veritable hemorrhaging of 
jobs: the American economy has shed approximately 
2.3 million jobs during that time 
span, the vast majority being manufacturing 
jobs. 

Moreover, China continues its practice of 
currency manipulation, where the Yuan is 
pegged to the American dollar at a depressed 
and fixed rate. This distorts the prices of imports 
and exports, making American imports 
artificially high and Chinese exports low. China 
is currently one of the top two holders of U.S. 
Treasury bonds; the other is Japan. 

Nonbinding saber rattling will not improve 
the human rights situation in China. We must 
get our priorities in order. If we take a hard 
look at the economic and financial policies that 
guide our relationship with China, we will realize 
that they continue to erode the American 
economy, attack the American family, and 
compromise our national security. 

I will continue to advocate for the open 
channels of dialogue and discussions that will 
lead to real change and understanding, and I 
will reject demagoguery that has no real effect 
and serves no valuable purpose in our foreign 
policy.

PRINCIPLES FOR A NATIONAL 
STRATEGY 

HON. IKE SKELTON 

OF MISSOURI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I rise tonight 
to speak about how the United States 
can best advance its national interests by 
adopting a new strategy. In my prior speeches, 
I have asserted that we currently lack an 
effective strategy and that the next President 
should engage in a focused effort, in concert 
with Congress and the American people, to 
identify and adopt a new strategy early in his 
Administration. I have noted that we live in a 
time when the U.S. is the world’s preeminent 
power, but also in a time when transnational 
events are increasingly significant and in 
which several large nations, and some entire 
regions of the world, are returning to prominence. 
All of this stresses the international 
system. 

I have asserted that the U.S. should continue 
to accept the challenge of world leadership, 
serving as the world’s indispensable nation, 
just as we have for the free world since 
the end of the Second World War; that we 
should fulfill this role not to seek or to maintain 
power for power’s sake, but by earning the 
mantle of leadership. We should advance our 
national interests not at the expense of others, 
but wherever possible in cooperation with 

them, as part of an international system that 
offers fairness and opportunity to all nations. 

So, I advise the next President, whoever it 
may be, to embark upon a process modeled 
on President Eisenhower’s Project Solarium in 
order to develop a new strategy for America. 
In Project Solarium, President Eisenhower selected 
three of our Nation’s top strategic thinkers 
to gather teams to study, propose, and report 
back to him on a national security policy. 
Should our future President follow this model, 
I recommend that he judge those new proposals 
against a simple set of principles: 

1. The first priority of the Federal Government 
is the protection of the U.S. homeland 
and its citizens. 
2. The foundation for continued U.S. leadership 
is the strength of our economy and our 
commitment to our values and principles. 
3. Do not let an outside power dominate Europe 
or the Western Pacific, and in addition 
maintain freedom of the seas. 
4. U.S. world leadership should be earned 
by virtue of the esteem other nations hold for 
us, engendered by our productivity and moral 
leadership, and not through a self-justifying 
hegemony which views the peaceful rise of 
other nations as an inherent threat. 
5. Insulate the Western Hemisphere from 
hostile outside powers with a collaborative approach. 
6. Transnational events that can undermine 
States and challenge or dislocate large numbers 
of people—the AIDS pandemic, terrorism, 
and global climate change to give a few examples—
should be addressed by international 
coalitions coordinating globally, using the full 
range of national power. 
7. Our military strength serves as both a 
source of deterrence for would-be aggressors, 
and reassurance for our friends and allies, but 
military action is a last resort. When it is 
used—whether multilateral or unilateral—strict 
adherence to the essential strategic tenets 
propounded by Sun Tzu and Clausewitz is 
mandatory. 
These principles do not in and of themselves 
define our strategy, for they leave 
many questions unanswered. What kind of 
international institutions, coalitions and alliances 
are essential? What red lines should 
trigger a certain U.S. response, even if it must 
be a unilateral response? How do we define 
what constitutes a fair opportunity to advance 
for those nations which perceive their current 
share of the world’s resources as inadequate? 
And what transnational events require a concerted 
international response? These are judgments 
for the next President; he should make 
them with input from a wide variety of sources. 
I ask all of my colleagues and all of those who 
have listened to these speeches to take part 
in a dialogue to help forge a new national consensus 
on a clear cut strategy that fulfills our 
principles and helps us answer these hard 
questions, ultimately guiding us to policies that 
are wise and just.

CONGRATULATING MRS. AUTINE 

BUCHANAN ON THE OCCASION OF 

HER 104TH BIRTHDAY 

HON. JO BONNER 

OF ALABAMA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. BONNER. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pride and pleasure that I rise to honor 

Mrs. Autine Buchanan on the occasion of her 
104th birthday. 

Born in 1904, Mrs. Buchanan has witnessed 
much change in our Nation and world. The 
year she was born, the New York subway first 
opened and the teddy bear was first produced. 

Mrs. Buchanan has lived through two world 
wars, and watched our nation develop into 
what it is today. She also witnessed the birth 
of many modern inventions—like the helicopter, 
penicillin, motion pictures, stainless 
steel, and even scotch tape. Through all this 
change, she has dedicated much of her life to 
feeding and caring for the needy. 

Mrs. Buchanan has been a resident of Mobile 
and a member of the Fulton Road Baptist 
Church for 39 years. She is a proud mother, 
grandmother, and great grandmother. She is 
also a member of the LivingWell Health Center 
in Mobile. 

Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Mrs. Autine Buchanan on 
the occasion of her 104th birthday. She is a 
friend to many throughout south Alabama, and 
I know her friends and family join me in wishing 
her a happy birthday.

WHERE OH WHERE HAS CONGRESS 
GONE? 

HON. TED POE 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, ‘‘Where oh 
where has Congress gone, 

Where o where can they be? 

With gas so high and this recess so long, 

Where oh where can they be?’’ 

Where oh where has Congress gone? Well 
Madam Speaker, they’re not here, they’ve gotten 
out of Dodge. They have left the American 
people behind in a cloud of dust and high gasoline 
prices. Congress is on the run; it has not 
dealt with the energy crisis and not attempted 
to solve high gasoline prices. So it’s sneaking 
out of town for five weeks-gone on vacation. 

The American people won’t be going on vacation, 
because they cannot afford gasoline to 
take a family trip. My 83 year old parents who 
are on fixed incomes cant even afford gasoline 
to go to church. So what is Congress’ answer? 
Leave town in the darkness of the 
night? 

The question Madam Speaker is why? Why 
don’t they stick around and let us vote on taking 
care of America? For example, let’s vote 
on offshore drilling—most Americans favor it. 
We are the representatives of America. Let’s 
vote, up or down, on offshore drilling. It’s an 
environmental myth that we cannot drill safely 
offshore. We need to drill in ANWAR. Why 
didn’t Congress stick around and vote on drilling 
in ANWAR? 

The American taxpayer shells out 425 million 
dollars a day to Saudi Arabia for crude oil. 
We pay this ransom because Congress won’t 
take care of America. The United States is the 
only major power in the world that does not 
use its own natural resources. This is nonsense 
and rather than deal with this crisis 
Congress has turned its back on the American 
people—dispersed to parts unknown throughout 
the fruited plain and fled town. This is 
shameful conduct. The President should use 
his constitutional power and call for a special 


E1682 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

session of this Congress to deal with energy. 
We should round up all those members of 
Congress that have fled the scene, bring them 
back and solve this energy crisis—specifically 
high gasoline prices. 

‘‘Where oh where has Congress gone, 

Where o where can they be? 

With gas so high and this recess so long, 

Where oh where can they be?’’ 

And that’s just the way it is.

HONORING JULIE EUBANK 

HON. BART GORDON 

OF TENNESSEE 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Madam 
Speaker, today I rise to honor Julie Eubank, a 
Smyrna, Tennessee native who has served 
the people of Middle Tennessee as a trusted 
member of my staff for the past six years. 
Julie has worked with me in a number of capacities. 
She started as an intern in my 
Murfreesboro District office and then moved to 
Washington as my scheduler. Julie ultimately 
became my Press Secretary, where she has 
served for the past four years. 

A Press Secretary has a position of great 
trust with a Member of Congress. They are responsible 
for keeping the lines of communications 
open between citizens and their representatives. 
Julie has done an exceptional 
job keeping the people of the 6th District informed 
on the many issues being debated in 
Congress. 

As a graduate of Smyrna High School and 
Middle Tennessee State University, Julie 
brings a special knowledge of the 6th District 
to her job that has been invaluable to me. She 
has treated every media outlet, regardless of 
size, with the same level of attention and care. 

Julie has been a source of levity when 
deadlines were tight, and her opinions are valued 
by my staff and me. She is leaving us 
next Thursday to head to Montana for the fall, 
and I know she will bring the same humor, 
professionalism, and talent to the ‘‘Treasure 
State’’ that she has shared with the people of 
the ‘‘Volunteer State.’’ Julie is a good friend 
and advisor and we will miss her in Washington, 
but wish her well as she pursues this 
new challenge.

COMMENDING THE MEDAL OF 

HONOR HOST CITY PROGRAM IN 

GAINESVILLE, TEXAS 

HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend the Medal of Honor (MOH) 
Host City Program in Gainesville, Texas. The 
program was established in 2001 to recognize 
the contributions of MOH recipients. In order 
to honor their accomplishments, invitations are 
extended to former MOH recipients to visit 
Gainesville; all their expenses are covered 
during their stay. The city has hosted more 
than a dozen medal recipients since the program’s 
inception. 

The Medal of Honor is the highest award for 
valor that can be bestowed upon a member of 

the United States Armed Forces for action 
against an enemy of the United States. The 
people of the United States will always be indebted 
to the recipients of the Medal of Honor 
for their courage, selflessness, and sacrifice. 

The first MOH recipient to visit Gainesville 
was Colonel Don ‘‘Doc’’ Ballard, a Vietnam recipient. 
Impressed by that 2001 visit, Ballard 
has returned each successive year. Recipient 
Mike Thornton, another Gainesville guest, was 
generous enough to set up a college scholarship 
fund for the local high school. As the 
Gainesville program has gained momentum, 
an annual, three-day celebration was established 
around March 25th, Medal of Honor 
Day. MOH recipients have the opportunity to 
speak at local schools, play in the Host City 
golf tournament, and visit the city’s historical 
Victorian homes. 

Madam Speaker, it is truly an honor to rise 
today and commend this outstanding program. 
Its volunteers have shown great leadership 
and hospitality in hosting these honorable veterans. 
I am proud to represent the Medal of 
Honor Host City Program in the 26th District of 
Texas.

PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT 

SPEECH OF 

HON. CAROLYN C. KILPATRICK 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the State of the Union had under 
consideration the bill (H.R. 1338) to amend 
the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide 
more effective remedies to victims of 
discrimination in the payment of wages on 
the basis of sex, and for other purposes. 

Ms. KILPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, in 2008, a 
year in which women have made unprecedented 
gains in public and private leadership—
Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; 
chairwomen of powerful committees 
and subcommittees; chief executive officers 
and chairwomen of Fortune 500 Companies, 
among many others—it is simply unforgivable 
and unacceptable that women, according 
to the U.S. Census Bureau, continue to 
make only 77 cents for every dollar earned by 
a man. Over a lifetime, this is anywhere from 
$400,000 to more than $2 million dollars that 
cannot be spent by a woman on food for her 
children, clothing for her grandparents, for decent 
housing for her and her family. In an era 
in heightened economic challenges, we should 
not, we cannot undervalue, underappreciate 
and marginalize the hard work that women do 
each and every day.

TRIBUTE TO JOHNSON COUNTY, 
KANSAS, FOR BEING RECOGNIZED 
AS ONE OF THE BEST 
PLACES TO LIVE AND RAISE A 
FAMILY 

HON. DENNIS MOORE 

OF KANSAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. MOORE of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Johnson County, 

Kansas, for being recognized by Forbes Magazine 
and CNN/Money as one of the best 
places to live and raise a family in the United 
States of America. 

On June 30, 2008, Forbes ranked Johnson 
County as the third best place in the country 
to raise a family. Similarly, CNN/Money.com 
has called Overland Park, Kansas, a city of 
nearly 170,000 people located in Johnson 
County, the ninth best place to live in the U.S. 

As a resident of Johnson County myself, I 
am particularly pleased that the county has 
earned such high praise. These media outlets 
have highlighted what my fellow Johnson 
County residents and I have known for years: 
great schools, affordable homes, and a growing 
economy have made Johnson County a 
great place to live. 

Located in Northeast Kansas, in suburbs of 
Kansas City, Missouri, Johnson County is 
home to more than 500,000 people spread 
across 21 different municipalities. Six school 
districts enroll nearly 80,000 K–12 students 
each year. Major businesses, including Yellow 
Freight, Applebees Restaurants, and Sprint 
Nextel have been headquartered in the county. 
The strong schools and impressive job 
growth, along with affordable homes, short 
commutes, and the low cost of living led 
Forbes to rank Johnson County third out of 
more than 90 counties from across the U.S. 
that the magazine surveyed. 

I’m proud to say that I have lived and 
worked in Johnson County for more than 30 
years. I’m even more proud to have served 
the citizens of Johnson County, first as District 
Attorney for 12 years, on the Board of Trustees 
for Johnson County Community College 
for 7 years, and as their U.S. Representative 
for the past 9 years. I want to commend the 
many city and county officials, public service 
workers, business leaders, investors, and 
above all, the numerous parents and grandparents 
who have worked so hard to help 
make Johnson County the wonderful place 
that it is today.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHIRAG SHAH 
AND KORI LORICK 

HON. JOE WILSON 

OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I am grateful for this opportunity to 
wish a fond farewell to two extraordinary 
members of South Carolina’s Second Congressional 
District Staff—Chirag Shah and 
Kori Lorick. 

Hailing from the great State of Wisconsin 
and son of Kamal and Jagruti Shah and brother 
of Chintan, Chirag was first an intern in the 
Second District office during college at the 
University of Wisconsin. We were fortunate 
that he chose to return to Capitol Hill and 
serve first as scheduler and then as legislative 
correspondent for the people of the Second 
Congressional District. Chirag will be heading 
to the University of Missouri for law school this 
fall. 

A native of Lexington, South Carolina, and 
daughter of Mary Alice Lorick and Neville 
Lorick, Kori joined the second district staff at 
the beginning of this year as a staff assistant 
following graduation from the College of William 
and Mary. Her important work on behalf

of constituents visiting the United States Capitol 
and directing the day-to-day activities of 
the front office have been a very special part 
of helping our office better serve the constituents 
of the Second Congressional District. Kori 
will be joining the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
in August. 

The people of the Second Congressional 
District of South Carolina have been well-
served by Chirag and Kori. Their dedication, 
hard work, and good humor will be missed. 
We wish them both good health and happiness 
in their future endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO KARA LAWSON AND 
DELANO THOMAS 

HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate and send the best wishes of 
California’s fifth district to Kara Lawson and 
Delano Thomas, two of our country’s elite athletes 
who will represent the United States in 
the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Both Kara and 
Delano reside in Sacramento, California’s fifth 
district. I hope that my colleagues will join me 
in wishing these two athletes, as well as all of 
our country’s amazing Olympic talent, the absolute 
best of luck. 

Kara is a star member of the Sacramento 
Monarchs WNBA team, a team which has 
seen its fair share of success. Lawson was a 
key member of the Monarch’s 2005 championship 
team. She is widely known in the WNBA 
as one of the league’s smartest players. In addition 
to her on court career, Lawson has 
been involved in sports broadcasting during 
the WNBA off-season, doing commentaries for 
men’s and women’s college basketball games 
and Sacramento Kings games. In fact, Kara 
was the first female to serve as a nationwide 
broadcast analyst for an NBA game. Kara is a 
continuing inspiration to Sacramento’s young 
women and we are honored that she will represent 
not only the United States but Sacramento 
as well, next month in Beijing. 

Delano Thomas has been a member of the 

U.S. volleyball team since May of 2005 and 
has proven himself as a team leader and 
points producing force. This well rounded athlete 
toyed, for a time, with the idea of playing 
football for the University of Hawaii, and got 
his start with volleyball, basketball and soccer 
at Sacramento’s John F. Kennedy High 
School. He pursued collegiate volleyball to become 
a freshman All American and member of 
the U.S. junior national team. According to 
USA Volleyball, ‘‘Delano was the United 
States leading server at the Pan American 
Games in 2007 with an average of 0.56 aces 
per set. He was the fourth-leading U.S. scorer 
at the Pan American Games with a total of 42 
points on 27 kills, six blocks and nine aces.’’ 
I am confident that he will help to push the 
U.S. to another astounding medal count. 
Madam Speaker, while controversy understandably 
surrounds this year’s Olympic 
games, I applaud our athletes for their accomplishments, 
pure of political influence and for 
shear enjoyment of their sport. I also know 
that Kara and Delano, along with all our outstanding 
athletes, will be model ambassadors 
of America’s world leadership and our coun


try’s foundational philosophy in a country 
where such freedoms aren’t as readily available. 


I applaud both of these individuals for their 
hard work, dedication, athleticism and achieving 
their goals. I thank them for serving our 
country as ambassadors and shining examples 
of American unity. I call on my colleagues 
to share in recognizing Kara and Delano, and 
to wish all of our 2008 Olympians a safe, fun, 
and successful experience.

MARIN MORRISON OF SAMMAMISH 

HON. DAVID G. REICHERT 

OF WASHINGTON 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of an extraordinary young 
woman from my District whose unyieldingly 
positive spirit in the face of a horrendous challenge 
is a true inspiration at any time, but especially 
leading up to the Summer Olympics in 
Beijing. 

Marin Morrison, 17, of Sammamish, Washington, 
was one of the top swimmers in the 
country as a 14-year-old. She was just 1.5 
seconds away from qualifying for the Olympic 
time trials. She received recruiting letters from 
some of the top schools in the country. She 
was a natural and earned medal after medal. 
However, fierce headaches and double vision 
turned her world upside down. An MRI revealed 
a tumor on her brain and doctors gave 
her 4 to 6 months to live. As a result of surgery 
in 2005, she was left partially paralyzed. 
She was forced to relearn some basics such 
as reading, writing and walking. It appeared 
her Olympic dreams were dashed. 

Although she sometimes struggled mightily, 
she swam nearly every day. She refused to 
give up and started a new type of Olympic 
journey. She battled fatigue and her other 
physical ailments like a heavyweight boxer 
and never stopped fighting. Classmates at 
Eastlake High School, family, friends, former 
Olympians and countless others rallied around 
her. Then in April, Marin flew to Minnesota for 
the paralympic trials and earned a spot on the 
37 member swim team, realizing her Olympic 
dream. 

Marin’s story is beyond inspiring. The circumstances

THE ANIMAL DRUG USER FEE 
AMENDMENTS OF 2008 

SPEECH OF 

HON. EDWARD J. MARKEY 

OF MASSACHUSETTS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of inclusion in this legislation of a 
technical fix to an important provision in the 
Federal Drug Administration Amendments, 
FDAAA, that I authored with Congressman 
WAXMAN. 

When the FDAAA was signed into law last 
September, it included a drafting error that 

had the effect of exempting medical devices 
from the requirement in the FDAAA that adverse 
events occurring during clinical trials 
must be reported to the registry and results 
data bank created by the bill. 

There is bipartisan agreement that this exemption 
resulted from a clerical error, not a 
deliberate change of policy. The data bank 
created by the bill is intended to provide patients 
with comprehensive information about 
clinical trials that are being conducted so they 
can consider enrolling in a trial and also learn 
about the benefits and problems associated 
with the drugs and medical devices that are 
being tested. 

The drafting error has the effect of only requiring 
drug companies to report medical 
problems that surface during clinical trials, exempting 
device companies. 

Everyone agrees that it was not the intent of 
Congress to exempt devices from reporting 
adverse events in their clinical trials. Both drug 
companies and device manufacturers were required 
to report to the database according to 
the agreement reached by Members on both 
sides of the aisle. 

I am pleased that this legislation fixes this 
clerical error.

35W BRIDGE COLLAPSE DISASTER 
MEMORIAL 

HON. JIM RAMSTAD 

OF MINNESOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. RAMSTAD. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
take a moment to remember the tragic event 
that occurred 1 year ago today when an eight-
lane bridge on Highway 35–W in downtown 
Minneapolis collapsed and took the lives of 13 
people. 

No Minnesotan will ever forget the night of 
August 1st. No Minnesotan will ever forget the 
horrifying image of the school bus, barely 
hanging onto the edge of a piece of concrete. 
We all wondered how many children were on 
the bus and how they could be rescued. 

But all those children made it off the bus to 
safety, thanks to the kindness of strangers. 
And that is what people will remember the 
most—the brave first responders and ordinary 
men and women who risked their lives to save 
others. 

Madam Speaker, our thoughts and prayers 
are still with the victims and their families, and 
we must do everything possible to assure a 
tragedy like this will never happen again. 

Minnesota has done a lot this year to improve 
the quality of its infrastructure. I am 
proud to say that after a year of hard work 
and dedication, the bridge is expected to re-
open in 2 months, ahead of schedule. 

Madam Speaker, my deepest gratitude goes 
to my colleagues who responded so quickly 
during Minnesota’s time of need, and to every 
person who responded to this disaster, saving 
lives, caring for the injured, comforting victims 
and their families and making our bridge 
whole again.

TRIBUTE TO THOMAS MORE 
PREPARATORY 

HON. JERRY MORAN 

OF KANSAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in recognition of Thomas More Preparatory—
Marian and their centennial celebration. 
Located in my hometown of Hays, Kansas, 
Thomas More Prep recently concluded a 
3 day festival commemorating 100 years of 
educational service. I stand before you in celebration 
of this remarkable milestone. 

TMP, as it is known in Northwest Kansas, 
has served as a pillar of faith-based learning 
for generations. Founded by Capuchin Priests 
in 1908 as Hays Catholic College, the school 
featured a combination high school and junior 
college curriculum and would become a vibrant 
military academy with an active Junior 
ROTC program. The school would evolve into 
St. Joseph’s Military Academy. 

St. Joseph’s Military academy was not alone 
in forming the foundation of what would become 
TMP-M. Girl’s Catholic High School, the 
female counterpart to the Academy, was 
founded in 1918. As was the case with St. Joseph’s, 
the school moved several times before 
it settled and was renamed Marian High 
School. 

The name Thomas More Prep was coined 
in 1970. In 1981, Marian High School and 
Thomas More Preparatory merged to form the 
school that is being recognized today. Madam 
Speaker, I emphasize the history of this fine 
institution in an effort to illustrate the dedication 
and sacrifice exhibited by those charged 
with its continuation. To administrate and fund 
a parochial school on the plains of Kansas for 
one hundred years is no small feat. Admiration 
is due to Fathers Henry Kluepfel and Eugene 
Beckner who founded what would become St. 
Joseph’s Military Academy in 1908 as well as 
Sister M. Reminga Neder, and Fr. Dominic 
Schuster who founded what would become 
Marian High school in 1918. Through their 
perseverance and leadership, an institution 
was established that would reach a global student 
body. 

As an institution serving many international 
boarders through the years, TMP-M has created 
a worldwide network of faithful alumni 
committed to the advancement of the school. 
The alumni of this educational system have 
much to be proud of. Each individual associated 
with TMP-M’s rich history has contributed 
to the overall identity that the school enjoys. It 
is through their generosity that the school continues 
to provide the services necessary to 
continue the long tradition of academic excellence. 


Admiration and thanks are also due to Ms. 
Jean Ross, current president of the school, 
Mr. Denis Coakley, principal and headmaster, 
and Mr. Gene Flax, assistant principal of student 
affairs. Through their faithful leadership, 
TMP-M has a bright future to coincide with 
their storied past. I ask God to continue to 
show his grace on this institution and I pray 
for its ongoing success. 

I ask you, Madam Speaker, to join me in 
congratulating Thomas More Prep.—Marian 
on 100 years of service to its students, alumni 
and the greater northwest Kansas community. 

CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4137, 

HIGHER EDUCATION OPPOR


TUNITY ACT 

SPEECH OF 

HON. VERNON J. EHLERS 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
support the conference report on the Higher 
Education Opportunity Act. As a conferee on 
this bill, I am very pleased that we have a final 
bill before us. I want to thank Chairman MILLER 
and Ranking Member MCKEON for all their 
hard work on this bill, and I especially thank 
them for including provisions that are very important 
to people in Michigan. 

Higher education is vitally important for students 
entering the workforce and for the global 
competitiveness of this country. This bill will 
ensure students have better access to higher 
education, and that they have received a high 
quality educational experience when they receive 
their degree. Now that a college degree 
is the bare minimum requirement for so many 
jobs, the need for better access is stronger 
than ever. 

Let me comment on some specific provisions 
in the bill. 

In 2007, Representative BLUMENAUER and I 
joined together to introduce the Higher Education 
Sustainability Act (H.R. 3637). I commend 
Representative BLUMENAUER for his 
leadership in ‘‘greening’’ colleges and universities, 
and I am grateful that he allowed me to 
partner with him on an issue that is so dear 
to my heart. I am very pleased that provisions 
of our bill have been included in the conference 
report, especially now when energy 
prices and shortages are on everyone’s mind. 

Simply put, sustainability is meeting the 
needs of the present generation without compromising 
the ability of future generations to 
meet their needs. As population growth, urban 
development and growing energy use place 
stress on our ecosystem, it is imperative that 
we develop innovative and successful sustainable 
operations and programs. 

Colleges and universities are in a unique 
position to foster new knowledge, evaluate 
policies and discover new technologies to address 
sustainability. Sustainable operations 
and programs on university campuses include 
water and energy conservation, recycling, and 
academic programs such as engineering 
courses that encourage innovative product designs, 
e.g., alternative fuels for cars, other 
new energy sources, and new types of packaging 
that use fewer natural materials. 

The conference report contains two key sustainability 
provisions. First, it convenes a Summit 
on Sustainability with higher education experts 
working in the area of sustainable operations 
and programs. The Federal Government 
and university and business leaders are 
encouraged to identify best practices in sustainability 
by promoting current efforts, enhancing 
research and identifying opportunities 
for partnerships to expand sustainable operations 
and academic programs. Also, it authorizes 
the Sustainability Grant Program. The 
Secretary of Education, in consultation with 
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, is authorized to award grants to 
colleges and universities to establish sustainability 
research programs, such as developing 

new alternative energy sources. It also allows 
schools to implement sustainability practices 
on campus. 

The conference report also contains an important 
study of distance education. It requires 
the Secretary of Education to contract with the 
National Research Council of the National 
Academy of Sciences to conduct a scientifically 
valid study of the quality of distance education, 
as compared to traditional, campus-
based education. With so many students using 
distance education and a huge Federal investment 
in helping students attend college, it is 
critical that we effectively evaluate new modes 
of instruction to ensure that our students are 
receiving a topnotch education. 

Finally, the conference report contains an 
array of provisions related to science, technology, 
engineering and math, collectively 
‘‘STEM’’, education. Notably, it includes the 
National STEM Database to allow students 
with an interest in the STEM fields to more 
easily find financial aid. Also, it authorizes important 
loan forgiveness for college graduates 
pursuing careers in the STEM fields, and it authorizes 
the Mathematics and Science Scholars 
Program to award scholarships to students 
pursuing STEM majors. Now, more than ever, 
we must increase the size of our STEM workforce 
to maintain our competitiveness and national 
security. 

In closing, I support this conference report 
since it helps students and makes many overdue 
improvements to the Higher Education 
Act. I urge all Members to vote in support of 
it.

COMMEMORATING JACK C. BINION 

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL’S RIBBON 

CUTTING CEREMONY 

HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the Birdville Independent 
School District upon the construction of an 
outstanding new educational facility in Richland 
Hills, Texas. This new building is an exciting 
step forward for the school district, and 
the ribbon-cutting ceremony for Jack C. Binion 
Elementary is planned for August 21, 2008. 

Binion Elementary is capably headed by 
Principal Paul Anderson and Assistant Principal 
Hilda Hager. The school welcomes students 
from pre-kindergarten through fifth 
grade, and has a total enrollment of over 500 
students. Binion’s mascot is the Bobcat, and 
their colors are maroon and white. 

Binion Elementary is the newest facility for 
the Birdville Independent School District, 
which consists of 32 schools and over 22,000 
students. Binion was founded in 1954 as 
Glenview Elementary. The first year the school 
opened, construction on the cafeteria wasn’t 
completed until November. For the first few 
months of classes, food had to be brought in 
from another school each day. The first Principal 
was Mr. Jack C. Binion, and his leadership 
was instrumental in getting the school off 
to an excellent start. In 2003, Glenview was 
renamed Jack C. Binion Elementary School. 

In the fall of 2006, voters approved the construction 
of a new campus for the elementary 
school. In summer of 2007, construction

SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND 
IDEALS OF THE APPLE CRUNCH 
AND THE NATION’S DOMESTIC 
APPLE INDUSTRY 

SPEECH OF 

HON. JOHN M. McHUGH 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, July 29, 2008 

Mr. MCHUGH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as 
a proud cosponsor of H. Res. 1143, which expresses 
support for the goals and ideals of the 
Apple Crunch and National Apple Month, 
which will be celebrated in October. Additionally, 
this measure promotes the importance of 
making healthy food choices, which apples 
certainly are, particularly when choosing 
snacks. As my constituents know, there is no 
better snack on a beautiful fall day in Upstate 
New York than a McIntosh apple. 

We have all heard the old adage of ‘an 
apple a day keeps the doctor away.’ In fact, 
recent studies have reinforced the nutritional 
and health benefits of apples. These studies 
have indicated that eating apples may help to 
prevent Alzheimer’s disease as well as certain 
types of cancer and heart disease. Additional 
studies have found that apple consumption 
may help to reduce coughing and perhaps 
even childhood asthma. 

In addition to promoting good health, this 
resolution also recognizes the importance of 
our Nation’s apple industry. The apple has 
long played an integral part in New York 
State’s economy and history, particularly in 
Clinton County which I have the privilege of 
representing. Specifically, by 1850, over 500 
varieties of apples had already originated in 
New York State, and of particular pride, the 
world famous McIntosh apple was first propagated 
and planted in the Champlain Valley in 
1835. Additionally, in 1969 the Acey Mac 
apple variety, known for being sweet, tart, and 
juicy, evolved in Peru, New York, which is located 
in Clinton County. 

Today, New York State is home to roughly 
694 commercial apple growers and produces 
about 25 million bushels each year, which 
makes it our nation’s second leading producer. 
Moreover, Clinton County is one of the State’s 
most productive counties. 

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the importance of 
apples to our health and economy. Accordingly, 
I am proud to be a cosponsor of H. Res. 
1143.

PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION TO PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT RECOGNIZING CHARLES E. SMITH 
STUDY THE CULTURE AND GLOUPON 
HIS INSTALLATION AS 
RIFICATION OF VIOLENCE IN PASTOR OF BEREA BAPTIST 
AMERICA ACT SPEECH OF CHURCH 

HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to introduce the Presidential Commission 
to Study the Culture and Glorification 
of Violence in America Act. This bill will establish 
a commission tasked with not only studying 
the culture of violence in our country, but 
also the factors that contribute to this culture 
and the actions that can be taken to mitigate 
its effects. 

Members of this Commission will determine 
what connections exist between violence and 
access to firearms, psychological stress, and 
economic despair. They will further examine 
what role schools can play in preventing violence 
and propose possible solutions to address 
the glorification of violence in the United 
States. 

Madam Speaker, we have become a society 
that places violence and aggression above 
hard work and acts of kindness. Sadly, children 
today admire gangsters instead of teachers. 
They would rather be thugs and drug 
lords than doctors and philanthropists. They 
measure the strength of their character by the 
size of their gun and not by their generosity 
toward others. 

The American Academy of Pediatrics has 
found that prolonged exposure to violence in 
the media can increase acceptance of violence 
as an appropriate means of solving 
problems. It can glamorize weapons as 
sources of personal power and can contribute 
to aggressive behavior. It is, therefore no surprise 
that in 2005 alone, there were over 1.8 
million serious violent crimes in America and 
almost 420,000 firearm-related incidents. In 
that same year, the Federal Government 
spent $35.4 billion on criminal justice and local 
governments spent nearly three times that 
amount. Worst of all however, teens and 
young adults experience the highest rates of 
violent crime. 

It is clear that we must make an effort to 
raise our children to recognize that violence is 
nothing more than the physical manifestation 
of fear and desperation. However, our society’s 
glorification of violence has become so 
ingrained in our culture that it has become 
seemingly impossible to reverse. 

Madam Speaker, it is our collective responsibility 
to create a society that values respect 
toward our fellow citizens. This legislation is 
simply a small step toward addressing what 
has become a destructive parasite upon the 
future of our country. By learning how the 
media and society promote violence and examining 
ways in which we can address this 
most pressing dilemma, it is my hope that we 
can stem the tide of violence and crime in 
America so that subsequent generations can 
live in a more peaceful nation. 

I ask for my colleagues’ support and urge 
the swift consideration of this bill. 

HON. MARK UDALL 

OF COLORADO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

The House In Committee of the Whole 
House on the State of the Union had under 
consideration the bill (H.R. 1338) to amend 
the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide 
more effective remedies to victims of 
discrimination in the payment of wages on 
the basis of sex, and for other purposes. 

Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 1338, the Paycheck 
Fairness Act. 

As its name suggests, this bill is about fairness. 
As a nation, we have made great strides 
in promoting fairness in the workplace since 
the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1963. Unfortunately, 
I do not think the language of that bill 
adequately addresses the problem of gender-
based wage discrimination. In particular, the 
language of the Equal Pay Act offers little 
remedy for women who are not being paid 
equal wages for doing equal work. 

The statistics describe precisely why this 
legislation is needed. Despite representing 
nearly half of the American workforce, and despite 
countless examples of professional 
women who have ascended to the highest levels 
of any given field, the U.S. Census Bureau 
estimates women still earn only 77 cents for 
every dollar earned by a man. 

This bill would require that employers, in 
justifying unequal pay, provide evidence-based 
reasoning that such pay discrepancies are job-
related and necessary for their business. It 
would help end the secret discrimination of unequal 
pay by prohibiting employers from retaliating 
against employees who share salary information 
with their coworkers. And this bill 
would dissuade employers from practicing 
gender-based pay discrimination by allowing 
women to sue for compensatory and punitive 
damages—the same sanctions that already 
apply to discrimination based on race, disability 
or age. 

There are also some amendments that I 
think are important to prevent unscrupulous 
people from unfairly taking advantage of the 
provisions in this bill. As I said, this bill is 
about fairness, so I support the amendment 
from the gentle lady from Arizona, Ms. GIFFORDS, 
which would clarify that a plaintiff 
would have to show intent to recover any punitive 
damages. I also support the amendment 
of another good friend from Arizona and a fellow 
supporter of earmark reform, Mr. FLAKE, 
which would prohibit any funds authorized 
under this bill from being used for Congressional 
earmarks. 

Women have long proven their equal measure 
of talent and capacity in every corner of 
the professional world. It’s long overdue that 
they be compensated equally as well, so I 
urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 

HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise before 
you today to recognize The Reverend 
Charles E. Smith, who will be installed as Pastor 
at Berea Baptist Church in Fort Worth, 
Texas. 

Pastor Smith is a native of Texas and a 
longtime resident of Fort Worth, where he has 
raised his family. He and wife Lawsha Smith 
have six children. Smith graduated from the 
Southern Bible Institute in Dallas in 1984, and 
prior to that completed a Bachelor of Science 
degree in architecture at the University of 
Texas at Arlington. In the nearly 25 years 
since the completion of his theological training, 
Smith has served in various capacities in Baptist 
churches throughout North Texas, the 
most recent being his role as Associate Minister 
at Berea. 

The multiple leadership and service awards 
that have been bestowed upon Pastor Smith 
testify to the fact that this is a man who is 
dedicated to excellence in serving his community. 
In addition to his service in a religious capacity, 
he has also positively contributed to his 
community as a Campus Learning Coordinator 
and Chancellor’s Leadership Committee member 
at Tarrant County College. 

Madam Speaker, I commend Pastor Smith 
for his longstanding service to Fort Worth and 
to the members of the Baptist congregations 
whom he has so capably served. It is an 
honor to represent Pastor Charles Smith and 
Berea Baptist Church in the 26th Congressional 
District of Texas.

THE LOSS OF PHIL RUHLE, SR. 

HON. JAMES R. LANGEVIN 

OF RHODE ISLAND 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
profound sorrow that I rise to recognize the 
loss of an important local figure, Captain Phil 
Ruhle, Sr., affectionately known to so many as 
Captain Phil. A resident of North Kingstown, 
Rhode Island, Captain Phil was lost at sea on 
July 23rd when his fishing boat capsized off 
the New Jersey shore. I join his family and the 
people of Rhode Island in mourning this great 
loss. 

An experienced fisherman who spent the 
majority of his life fishing the Atlantic Ocean, 
Captain Phil was deeply devoted to his career, 
and his passion for responsible fishing was 
unparalleled. Born in Oceanside, NY, he 
moved to Rhode Island early in life. He hails 
from a long line of fishermen, including his 
grandfather, father and brother, and his son 
has followed in his footsteps. Throughout his 
life, Captain Phil was tested many times. 
Twice before, he was aboard a fishing vessel 
that sank. However, despite those setbacks, 
he continued to persevere and pursue his passion 
in life. 

Captain Phil will be remembered as one 
who strongly advocated for those in his field,

to serve as a key voice for the fishing industry. 
Most notably, he worked with fishermen and 
researchers to develop the ‘‘Eliminator’’ trawl, 
designed to catch haddock while reducing by-
catch of cod and flounder, permitting a faster 
recovery of depleted stocks and benefiting the 
entire industry. I had the opportunity to see 
the trawl first-hand just a few weeks ago on a 
visit to Galilee, Rhode Island. While there, I 
also had the pleasure of discussing a variety 
of policy matters with the Captain’s son, Phil, 
Jr. I know his dad would have been proud of 
his deep knowledge and commitment to the 
issues that impact their industry. 

Captain Phil engaged deeply in policy matters, 
representing Rhode Island on the New 
England Fisheries Management Council. He 
was a familiar face in my office, frequently visiting 
and calling to keep us apprised of the 
most recent developments in fisheries policy 
and regulations. I appreciated his advice and 
his counsel, and he will be deeply missed. 

Captain Phil is survived by his mother, Gloria, 
his wife, Donna, his children Phil Jr., 
Roger, and Alicia, and seven grandchildren. 
May we keep his loved ones in our thoughts 
and prayers as they endure this difficult period. 


With this loss, we are reminded that fishing 
is an important but dangerous profession. I 
ask that we all remember the sacrifices that 
have been made and that we pray for the safe 
return of all those away at sea.

34TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
DIVISION OF CYPRUS 

HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember the unfortunate division of the island 
nation of Cyprus that began 34 years ago 
this July. 

On July 20, 1974, Turkey dispatched thousands 
of armed forces to the island of Cyprus. 
As a result of this action, Cyprus remains divided 
to this day. 43,000 Turkish troops still 
occupy a significant portion of the island nation, 
which is enough for one Turkish soldier 
per each Turkish Cypriot. The presence of 
these troops is in spite of the clear preference 
for a peaceful and mutually acceptable solution 
demonstrated by all inhabitants of Cyprus. 
Nonetheless, there are positive indications for 
the island’s future. 

The willingness of both Greek- and Turkish-
Cypriot leaders to pursue reunification talks is 
heartening. We in the U.S. Congress were 
pleased to see that last Friday, July 25, leaders 
of the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot 
communities jointly announced that they have 
decided to start full-fledged Cyprus settlement 
negotiations on September 3, 2008, under the 
good offices mission of the U.N. Secretary-
General. 

It is essential that these talks result in the 
reunification of Cyprus as a bicommunal and 
bizonal federation that respects human rights 
and fundamental freedoms for all Cypriots. 
The removal of Turkish forces will allow this 
process to go forward. 

I join with other proponents of a peaceful 
solution on Cyprus in supporting the recent 

steps taken by the divided nation’s leaders. 
However, an acceptable political solution will 
only be possible if the international community 
continues to press for more substantive reconciliatory 
actions in the future. While the 
United Nations has passed numerous resolutions 
condemning the division of Cyprus, Turkey 
continues to maintain more troops on the 
island than the United States has in Afghanistan. 
This is a clear indication that more must 
be done by the international community to 
make clear that the militarization of Cyprus is 
unacceptable. 

As the more than 13 million incident-free 
crossings of the line dividing the Turkish-Cypriot 
and Greek-Cypriot portions of the island 
attest, the people of Cyprus are hungry for a 
peaceful reconciliation of their island. So am I. 
The goal of the United States and of the international 
community must be the withdrawal of 
Turkish troops from Cyprus, the institution of 
democratic institutions and practices there, 
and the peaceful resolution to this decades-old 
dispute in a manner that respects the human 
and democratic rights of all the people who 
call Cyprus their home. 

As we move into the 35th year since the division 
of Cyprus, I urge my colleagues to remember 
the tragic events of the past on this 
small island nation. At the same time, I pledge 
to the people of Cyprus that the United States 
stands with them in their quest for an expeditious 
and peaceful solution to the division of 
their home island.

TRIBUTE TO THE SOUTHERN CALI


FORNIA REGION OF THE CHRIS


TIAN METHODIST CHURCH 

HON. KEN CALVERT 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to a church whose 
dedication and contributions to the community 
of southern California are exceptional. Southern 
California is fortunate to have dedicated 
religious organizations that willingly and unselfishly 
give their time to make their communities 
a better place to live, work and worship. 
From August 24, 2008 to August 27, 2008 
Amos Temple Christian Methodist Episcopal, 
C.M.E., Church in Riverside, led by Pastor 
Julio A. Andujo, will serve as host for the 2008 
Episcopal District of the Christian Methodist 
Church Conference. 

The Conference will take place at the Riverside 
Convention Center in Riverside, California. 
The Right Reverend Bishop Henry M. 
Williamson, Sr., Presiding Prelate of the 9th 
Episcopal District of the C.M.E. Church will 
convene the annual conference. 

The Christian Methodist Episcopal Church 
came into existence following the issuance of 
the historic Emancipation Proclamation, which 
signaled the movement from slavery to freedom, 
and gave former slaves the dignity and 
honor to worship in their own church. 

On December 16, 1870, in Jackson, Tennessee, 
41 delegates from the Colored Annual 
Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church 
South organized their own separate and independent 
religious organization, chose a name 
for their Church and met all the requirements 
of the American Methodism. 

The C.M.E. Church successfully met the 
challenges of providing higher education by 
establishing such historically African-American 
colleges as Lane College, Jackson, Tennessee, 
1882; Paine College, Augusta, Georgia, 
1882; Texas College, Tyler, Texas, 1884; 
Miles College, Birmingham, Alabama, 1905; 
and the Phillips School of Theology, 1958, Atlanta, 
Georgia. 

Through the years the C.M.E. has shown a 
remarkable sensitivity to the spirit of changing 
times as evidenced by the 1954 resolution by 
the General Conference to change the name 
from the ‘‘Colored Methodist Episcopal’’ to the 
‘‘Christian Methodist Episcopal Church.’’ 

The C.M.E. Church has continuously shown 
a commitment to higher education, civic pride 
and spiritual leadership. Under Bishop 
Williamson’s leadership, the 9th Episcopal District 
has embraced his ‘‘One Church One 
School Community Partnership Program’’ 
which involves churches and schools in partnership 
to teach young people to value life 
and learning. 

The Christian Methodist Church is truly a 
pillar in the community of Riverside, California 
and throughout the state and country. I commend 
the members and leadership of the 

C.M.E. for their dedication to worship, to their 
neighbors and to the Christian way of life.

RECOGNIZING THE FINANCIAL 

SERVICES ROUNDTABLE’S COM


MUNITY SERVICE 2008 INITIATIVE 

HON. DENNIS MOORE 

OF KANSAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. MOORE of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in recognition of Community Service 2008 
(CS08), an initiative being spearheaded by Financial 
Services Roundtable and its member 
companies to harness volunteerism in the financial 
services sector and improve the communities 
in which we all live and work. 

CS08 companies will complete 1,000 community 
service projects between July 1 and 
September 30, in all 50 states with over 
28,000 volunteers. In Overland Park, which I 
represent, a CS08 event was just completed 
with AXA Equitable in which employees 
teamed up with KVC Behavioral HealthCare to 
sponsor a historical tour to youth being treated 
there. 

This expansive effort would not be possible 
without the strong leadership of CS08 co-
chairs Richard K. Davis, Chairman, President, 
and CEO of U.S. Bancorp, and Don J. 
McGrath, Chairman and CEO of Banc West 
Corporation. 

Now in its seventh year, the timely focus of 
CS08 is on financial education, and increasing 
visibility of financial education programs in 
communities. This is in addition to member 
companies’ community service projects via 
blood drives, building homes, neighborhood 
cleanups, or even outreach to children, like in 
Overland Park. Roundtable member companies 
know that the possibilities for community 
improvement are vast. 

I am also proud to recognize our CS08 Honorary 
Congressional Host Committee. 141 
Members of Congress have volunteered to 
sponsor CS08 and I know I speak for all of the 
participants in thanking my colleagues in the 


E1688 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

House and Senate for their leadership. Congratulations 
to all who are working to make 
CS08 a huge success.

CHIEF DAN PACKER: IN 
MEMORIAM 

HON. DAVID G. REICHERT 

OF WASHINGTON 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. REICHERT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of Chief Dan Packer, the 
former Chief of East Pierce Fire and Rescue 
who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the line of 
duty Saturday, July 26, 2008, in Northern California. 


Packer, the only chief of the East Pierce 
district and the past president of Washington 
Fire Chiefs, arrived in Northern California on 
June 25, 2008, to assist in the Panther Creek 
fire as a Division Supervisor. He was called to 
duty by the U.S. Forest Service and immediately 
leaped at the opportunity to serve and 
protect in another community. 

Chief Packer began his career as a firefighter 
in Burien, Washington, in 1981. In 
1995, he took over as the fire chief of Bonney 
Lake, Washington, and transformed the department 
of six firefighters into East Pierce 
Fire and Rescue. The district now serves 
nearly 75,000 people in the areas of Bonney 
Lake, Sumner, Lake Tapps, South Prairie and 
Wilkeson; about 142 square miles total. Aside 
from his duties as a day-to-day leader at East 
Pierce Fire and Rescue, Chief Packer argued 
patiently, eloquently and reasonably before the 
State Legislature in order to make the people 
he served in Pierce County safer. 

During a time of reflection such as this, 
many phrases continue to appear while describing 
the kind of servant Chief Packer was. 
I read Chief Packer was ‘‘a firefighter’s fire 
chief,’’ a ‘‘visionary leader,’’ and a ‘‘great and 
exceptional man.’’ The residents of East 
Pierce County have lost a wonderful leader 
and I grieve with you. To the fire personnel 
who worked under and alongside Chief Packer: 
I understand your pain. I have experienced 
losing a partner in the line of duty. 

Most of all Madam Speaker, we grieve with 
the family of Chief Packer. He was a son, a 
husband, father and grandfather; his sacrifice 
was also their sacrifice and their loss. But they 
can live with the comfort in his spirit and the 
hope that his spirit lives on to inspire others 
with his true heroism and willingness to serve 
to protect all of us. That is the spirit of a first 
responder and the memory of Chief Packer 
we must always honor and never forget.

INTRODUCTION OF THE WORKER 
SAVINGS ACCOUNT ACT 

HON. JOHN M. McHUGH 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. MCHUGH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce legislation, the Worker Savings 
Account Act of 2008, which is designed to 
help Americans should they become unemployed. 


American workers today are less likely to 
spend their careers with a single employer, 

particularly as United States companies face 
increasing global competition. These forces— 
technological advances, increased trade, lower 
transportation costs, and enhanced communications—
have greatly facilitated the movement 
of jobs offshore, including both services 
and high-skilled sectors. Corporations have 
sought to streamline their operations through 
technological innovations, outsourcing, lay-
offs, and moving to lower-cost locations. Not 
surprisingly, the total number of U.S. manufacturing 
jobs has fallen by 1.8 million since November 
2001, from 15.8 million to 14 million. 

The loss of employment is not limited to 
those impacted by the global economy, but is 
something virtually every worker could experience. 
In fact, 19 million Americans were laid 
off or discharged from their employment in 
2006. A 2005 Government Accountability Office 
(GAO) report found that 85 percent of 
American workers born between 1957 and 
1964 were unemployed at least once between 
1979 and 2002. 

There are a variety of benefits that may be 
available to Americans to help them during 
times of unemployment. These include those 
provided through the Unemployment Compensation 
(UC), Trade Adjustment Act (TAA), 
Alternative Trade Adjustment Act (ATAA), Disaster 
Unemployment Assistance (DUA), and 
the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) programs. 

For example, the UC program is the cornerstone 
of the government’s efforts to assist unemployed 
workers with their continued income 
needs. Established in 1935, the UC program 
provides critical support to covered workers 
who become involuntarily unemployed. In December 
2007, approximately 2.7 million unemployed 
workers received UC benefits in a 
given week. 

The average weekly UC recipient currently 
gets $281 and monies are usually available for 
up to 26 weeks, although this Congress recently 
enacted legislation with my support to 
temporarily provide an additional 13 weeks. In 
fiscal year 2007, the average regular UC benefit 
duration was 15 weeks or almost four 
months. When one considers rising costs, particularly 
for gasoline and food, it is not surprising 
that some estimates indicate that about 
42 million Americans are living paycheck to 
paycheck. It is clear that many of our citizens 
are not well prepared for periods of unemployment. 
This is particularly evident when one 
notes that financial planners often advise people 
to build up three to six months in emergency 
savings to cover necessities such as 
monthly mortgage and car payments, utilities, 
insurance, food, home maintenance, and 
health care. 

The Worker Savings Account Act is designed 
to help Americans enhance their personal 
safety nets. The measure would allow 
people to establish Worker Savings Accounts 
(WSAs) to supplement the benefits they might 
otherwise receive while unemployed including 
assistance received through the UC, TAA, 
ATAA, DUA, and WIA programs. Moreover, 
the Act clearly states that a person’s decision 
to have a WSA shall in no way diminish their 
entitlement to receive those payments. 

Like traditional Individual Retirement Accounts 
(IRAs), WSAs would have an annual 
contribution limit of $5,000, indexed to inflation. 
However, employers would be able to 
provide matching contributions of up to $5,000 
annually. Contributions to WSAs would be permitted 
until the account owner actually elects 

to take Social Security retirement benefits. At 
that time, a WSA account owner could choose 
to roll over their WSA funds into a 401(k) or 
IRA; alternatively, the WSA funds could be 
withdrawn without penalty but subject to taxation. 
Prior to a WSA account owner’s decision 
to take Social Security payments, WSA 
funds could be withdrawn without penalty and 
tax-free as long as the owner lost their employment 
through no fault of their own or they 
had become disabled. 

To encourage lower-income Americans to 
take advantage of the opportunity to contribute 
to WSAs, the Worker Savings Account Act 
would provide a refundable tax credit of up to 
$1,000 for eligible individuals. This tax credit 
would be indexed to inflation and recipients 
could receive up to $5,000 over the course of 
their career. 

Madam Speaker, while this legislation would 
help every American build or enhance their 
personal safety net, it would be particularly 
helpful to my constituents. To illustrate, in 
June 2008, five of the 11 counties I represent 
in Northern and Central New York had unemployment 
figures that exceeded the national 
and state rates. Accordingly, I ask my colleagues 
to join with me as I work to enact the 
Worker Savings Account Act of 2008.

CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, 

CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY 

IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 

SPEECH OF 

HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to express my support of H.R. 4040, the Consumer 
Product Safety Committee, CPSC, Reform 
Act, introduced by Representative BOBBY 

L. RUSH on November 1, 2007. 
The passage and enactment of the CPSC 
Reform Act is necessary to ensure our children’s 
safety from unsafe products that threaten 
their health and well-being. Unfortunately, 
the year of 2007 is known as a Year of Recall, 
with one million toys recalled from the American 
market. The danger that these recalled 
toys posed to our children is frightening. Children 
suffered the threat of unnecessary 
deaths and injuries from contact with contaminated 
and poisoned toys and products. Lead, 
phthalate and other dangerous chemicals are 
widely used in products, creating a health 
threat for our young children and their parents. 

This threat can be and must be prevented. 
By demanding that toy manufacturers stop 
using deadly chemicals and ensuring safety 
with legislative and governmental assistance, 
we can save our kids. The American government 
has the ability to protect our children and 
prevent future tragedies. The CPSC Reform 
Act proposes a strengthening of the authority 
of the Government to act to ensure safety of 
American citizens. 

I strongly support the Reform Act. The enactment 
of this important bill shall not be delayed. 
With the holiday season coming soon, 
a new flow of toys and products will arrive and 
we need to have greater assurance of their 
safety. The legislation can prevent the risk, 
protecting our vulnerable children. We must 
act now, refusing any hazardous chemicals in 
products of our children.

public disclosure of information regarding a 
consumer product where disclosure will permit 
the public to ascertain readily the identity 
of the manufacturer or private labeler, 
including decreasing some waiting periods 
before the CPSC may disclose information 
and providing for expedited court actions. 

Requires the CPSC to maintain on its 
website a publicly available, searchable 
database that includes any reports received 
by the CPSC of injuries, illness, death, or 
risk of such injury, illness, or death related 
to the use of consumer products received by 
the CPSC from consumers, government agencies, 
and nongovernmental sources other 
than information provided to the CPSC by 
manufacturers, private labelers, or retailers. 
Allows inclusion in the database of comments 
by manufacturers, labelers, or retailers. 


(Sec. 8) Modifies procedures for promulgating 
consumer product safety rules under 
the Consumer Product Safety Act or the 
Flammable Fabrics Act or regulations under 
the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. Allows,

(Sec. 10) Requires third party laboratory 
testing (and related certification) of certain 
products for use by, or care of, a child seven 
or younger that are subject to a consumer 
product safety standard or a rule. 

Requires, if an advertisement, label, or 
package contains a reference to a consumer

consumer product or other product or substance 
over which the CPSC has jurisdiction 
under any Act (except for motor vehicle 
equipment) to notify the CPSC of certain 
substantial product hazards. (Current law requires 
such notification only regarding a 
consumer product, but makes no reference to 
other products or substances over which the

or otherwise affect any other federal, state, 
or local law, any rule or regulation, or any 
state cause of action. 

(Sec. 18) Authorizes the CPSC to make certain 
information obtained by the CPSC 
available to any federal, state, local, or foreign

Act. Excludes components that are 
not accessible to a child and will not become 
physically exposed through normal and reasonably 
foreseeable product use and abuse. 
Prohibits considering paint, coatings, or 
electroplating to be a barrier that would 
render lead in the substrate inaccessible to a 
child. Allows the CPSC to exclude lead crystal. 


Requires the CPSC, if it determines it is 
not feasible for electronic devices, including 
batteries, to comply with that requirement, 
to issue standards and establish a schedule 
for full compliance. Allows the CPSC to establish 
more stringent levels than those 
specified in this Act. 

Lowers the lead threshold at which paint 
becomes a banned hazardous product. 

(Sec. 23) Requires the CPSC to study the 
feasibility of establishing a measurement 
standard based on a units-of-mass-per-area

ON THE BIRTH OF SARAH LILIAN

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I am happy to congratulate my friend 
Sunny Philips and her husband Jay Philips of 
Columbia, SC on the birth of their daughter 
Sarah Lilian Philips. Sarah Lilian Philips was 
born on July 31, 2008, weighing 6 pounds and

THE CONSUMER ENERGY RELIEF 
ACT OF 2008 

HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to introduce H.R. 6653, the Consumer 
Energy Relief Act. This legislation will 
provide Americans short- and long-term relief 
from rising energy costs by implementing a 
comprehensive strategy to reduce America’s 
oil dependence while also driving down the 
price of gasoline. 

In January 2001, when President Bush took 
office, the price of oil was $30 per barrel, and 
the average price for a gallon of gasoline was 
about $1.50. After 71/2 years of energy policies 
spearheaded by President Bush, Vice President 
CHENEY, two oil men in their own right, 
and their friends in the oil industry, oil companies 
in the United States are earning record 
profits, the cost per barrel of oil has spiked to 
$134 and Americans are spending at least 
$3.96 on a gallon of gasoline. 

Energy costs this high place a tremendous 
burden on the American people at a time 
when our economy is already on the verge of 
recession. The Consumer Relief Act takes important 
steps to reduce gas prices, eliminate 
our dependence on oil for fuel, and provide 
real relief to the American people by addressing 
the root causes of the spike in energy 
costs. 

First, it will impose tighter regulations on excessive 
speculation. While the speculation 
market is a necessary function of America’s 

economy, the deregulation of the market 
under the Bush administration has allowed the 
oil and gas market to be manipulated. Experts 
have testified that excessive speculation may 
be responsible for inflating prices by as much 
as $20 to $60 more per barrel. By regulating 
the speculation market, this bill will restore 
stability to international commodity trading and 
protect the American people from exorbitant 
gas prices. 

Secondly, this bill will grant the Federal 
Trade Commission the authority to investigate 
and punish companies that artificially inflate 
the price of energy. The need for this provision 
is clear. An investigation of 1,000 gas 
stations in New Jersey resulted in tickets for 
350 violations of gasoline price gouging-related 
offenses. Among the citations issued 
were: 62 violations for the pump not accurately 
metering, or measuring, fuel, 46 violations 
for per-gallon prices being different on 
each side of the pump, 37 violations for fuel 
grades (octane rating labels) not posted, 26 
violations for inaccurate octane ratings, 19 violations 
for inaccurate total sale price calculation 
and 14 violations for multiple price 
changes in a 24-hour period. This investigation 
is indicative of what is occurring all over 
the country. Price gouging has become an 
epidemic. 

Lastly, H.R. 6653 addresses the causes of 
our Nation’s energy crisis by infusing a major 
investment in the research and development 
of renewable energy as well as providing financial 
assistance for the purchase of energy 
efficient appliances and vehicles. This investment 
will provide immediate relief to Americans 
by helping reduce their energy costs in 
the short-term by providing financial assistance 
for the purchase of efficient appliances 
and vehicles, and in the long-term by reducing 
our Nation’s dependence on foreign oil by injecting 
much needed capital for the development 
of alternative energy. 

The Consumer Energy Relief Act pays for 
this investment by establishing a windfall profits 
tax on oil companies who have benefited 
from President Bush’s policies that protect the 
profit margins of oil companies over the tight 
budgets of hard-working Americans. Just 
today we learned that ExxonMobil is projected 
to earn a record $52 billion this year and that 
the five largest oil companies in the United 
States are expected $168 million. 

Madam Speaker, American families and 
businesses are reeling from record prices—the 
result of 7 years of missed opportunities and 
an energy policy this White House has literally 
allowed the oil industry to write. Their policy is 
working for only one group: the oil companies 
which are earning record profits while Americans 
are paying record prices. The failure to 
diversify our energy sources with bold investments 
in renewable energy and more efficient 
technology, leaves us dangerously dependent 
on foreign oil, and hurts our economy and 
American families. The Consumer Energy Relief 
Act sets the United States on a different 
course, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

MOTION TO ADJOURN 

HON. MARK UDALL 

OF COLORADO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I 
must oppose this motion to adjourn, because 

I think the House should continue trying to 
pass legislation to improve our national energy 
policies. 

Regrettably, so far our repeated efforts to 
do that have been thwarted by the refusal of 
our friends on the other side of the aisle to 
support any of the proposals that have been 
considered. 

They seem ready to put a perceived political 
advantage over working on a bipartisan basis 
to achieve results. 

Otherwise, I cannot explain their recent 
votes on energy legislation. 

Looking back, we see that a majority of 
Congressional Republicans have time and 
again voted against sensible energy legislation. 


They have voted against renewable energy, 
against the first new vehicle efficiency standards 
in 32 years—saving $1,000 in fuel costs 
per car per year—and against reducing transit 
fares for commuter rail and buses. 

They have voted against expedited drilling 
in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve and 
against adding a due-diligence requirement 
that could stimulate expedited exploration and 
development on other Federal lands already 
leased for that purpose. 

They also voted against releasing 10 percent 
of the record amounts of oil stored in the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve (to be replaced 
with heavy oil that is better suited for that storage), 
even though that addition to the supplies 
on the market could ease gas prices. 

And, finally, too many of our Republican colleagues 
opposed better regulation of the commodity 
markets, to reduce the ability of speculators 
to artificially increase the price of oil, 
even though the bill had been approved in the 
Agriculture Committee by voice vote and was 
supported by the committee’s ranking Republican 
member. 

So, I certainly understand why many of our 
colleagues are prepared to give up for now 
and adjourn today in order to begin the normal 
August district work period. 

But I think we owe it to our constituents and 
to the country to stay here at least for now, 
and to continue working on energy legislation. 
And for that reason, I cannot vote for this motion 
to adjourn.

STATEMENT IN HONOR OF LEE 
KLING 

HON. RUSS CARNAHAN 

OF MISSOURI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the outstanding contributions 
made by fellow Missourian, Lee Kling, an 
individual who placed the needs of country 
above his own. 

Like many great Americans, Lee did not 
stand steadfastly by; instead, he insisted on 
getting involved. He saw his plight not in terms 
of one or a few, but as one shared by many. 

Sadly, we have lost a great American in Lee 
Kling. 

He was a man who invested in his community 
and family, and always found the time to 
give. 

No job was too little or big for Lee. Whether 
at the center of Presidential politics, involved 
in efforts to save military bases, or rebuilding 


E1692 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

our state highway system, he was proven in 
advancing the best of any cause that might 
come his way. 

He took on all comers with a positive attitude, 
and fought back against unwanted turns 
of life. 

Because of him, and his principled approach 
to business, building a better community was 
always possible. 

It is with great thanks to Lee that we are all 
left with such great civic pride. 

I am grateful for his example, and I honor 
his life and achievements that serve as a 
great example for us all.

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I stand 
before you today to recognize Wireless 
Broadband Company for their far-sighted provision 
of high speed Internet services to rural 
areas. 

Wireless Broadband Company is a pioneer 
in the high speed Internet industry as they are 
reaching customers that larger companies 
have deemed unprofitable. This company has 
earned my respect for remembering that rural 
communities should not be left behind in the 
Information Age. Farmers, ranchers, lake-area 
inhabitants, and other country dwellers now 
have immediate access to online communities 
and knowledge databases thanks to the innovation 
and concern of this company. Wireless 
Broadband Company will be opening their 
third office and continues to expand their service 
capacity to rural areas. 

Madam Speaker, I commend the management 
and employees of Wireless Broadband 
Company for the positive professional contribution 
they have made to rural communities, 
notably constituents within the 26th District of 
Texas. I warmly congratulate Wireless 
Broadband Company upon the opening of 
their third store and wish them continued business 
growth.

CONDEMNING THE PERSECUTION 

OF BAHA’IS IN IRAN 

SPEECH OF 

HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, the Baha’i 
faith emphasizes unity within the human race. 
The Baha’i teachings are built on the values of 
peace and unification. 

Although the history of the Baha’i faith is a 
turbulent one, they have maintained unity within 
their own faith. Their faith teaches that unity 
manifests a global community that is complete 
with social and economic equality, the elimination 
of prejudice, education for all, collective 
security and the elimination of extreme poverty 
and wealth. 

With these values in mind this body should 
be attentive to the ways in which we can bring 
about the unification of the human race and 
instill world peace. Affirming strong support for 
religious freedom for all people throughout the 
world and working to ensure this freedom is 
maintained at all times for all people is important. 
Our religious freedom is an inherent right, 
a human right and must be protected. It must 
be said, however, that the act of condemning 
is not the best way to bring about these important 
goals. 

In the spirit of honoring the Baha’i faith we 
should work to bring about the peace and unification 
that ends egregious persecution. The 
United States should engage Iran in high-level 
diplomatic negotiations. Engaging Iran diplomatically 
honors the spirit of unity that is 
central to the Baha’i faith and brings us closer 
to peace.

INTRODUCTION OF THE MEDICARE 

IMAGINE DISCLOSURE SUNSHINE 

ACT 

HON. CAROLYN McCARTHY 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mrs. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce companion legislation to S. 
3343, the Medicare Imagine Disclosure Sunshine 
Act of 2008. This legislation would require 
physicians, at the time certain imaging 
procedures are ordered, to inform the patient 
of any ownership interest the physician may 
have in those imaging services and provide 
the patient with a list of other, local imaging 
providers. 

This legislation is based on recommendations 
by both the Medicare Payment Advisory 
Commission (MedPAC) and the Government 
Accountability Office (GAO). 

The Medicare Imaging Disclosure Sunshine 
Act will provide beneficiaries more transparency 
and disclosure of potential conflicts of 
interest when physicians write referrals for imaging 
services while also providing beneficiaries 
with the consumer-friendly option to 
choose when and where they seek an imaging 
procedure. 

Madam Speaker, I believe this legislation 
takes an important step toward a more transparent 
referral procedure, and in the coming 
weeks I plan to continue to work on this legis


lation with the committees of jurisdiction and 
stakeholders and revise it so that it achieves 
the best possible balance for physicians, 
beneficiaries, and the health of the Medicare 
system.

TRIBUTE TO THE 75TH ANNIVER


SARY OF THE MONTVILLE POL


ISH CLUB 

HON. JOE COURTNEY 

OF CONNECTICUT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and celebrate the 75th anniversary 
of the Montville Polish Club. On August 
30, 2008, the club will commemorate 75 
years of history with a night of celebration including 
traditional pierogi, kielbasa, and 
kapusta and Polish dancing. 

In the midst of the Great Depression, John 

J. Smith, Sam Onuparik and John Emilyta, 
conceived the idea for a regional Polish-American 
club to help connect and empower citizens 
of Polish descent in Montville, Connecticut 
and surrounding communities. In 
1932, with the help of Walter Walenczyk, 
these men were able to garner support from 
33 additional members of the community. In 
October of that year, the Montville Polish Club 
convened their first meeting in the Papyis Hall 
in Uncasville, Connecticut. 
In a time of great financial uncertainty, the 
Montville Polish Club offered hope and opportunity 
through continuity for members of the 
Polish community in eastern Connecticut. For 
newly arrived Polish immigrants, the club offered 
opportunities to acclimate to American 
life, providing English lessons, assistance with 
employment, and fellowship. For established 
Polish-American families, the club offered opportunity 
to preserve native cultures and traditions. 


Today, the club remains an integral part of 
the eastern Connecticut community, hosting 
picnics, plays, parties, and dances. The club 
has also proven a civic leader, sponsoring 
countless youth organizations. 

Madam Speaker, 75 years ago the Montville 
Polish Club was founded by a few Polish men 
with great hopes of bringing their community 
together. Today, with over 500 members, the 
club’s continuity remains as strong as ever. I 
ask my colleagues to join with me and my 
constituents in recognizing and celebrating the 
Montville Polish Club’s 75th anniversary.

APOLOGIZING FOR THE ENSLAVE


MENT AND RACIAL SEGREGA


TION OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS 

SPEECH OF 

HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 

OF MINNESOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, July 29, 2008 

Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of H. Res. 194, a 
resolution that apologizes for the enslavement 
and racial segregation of African-Americans. 

It may be unimaginable today, but for more 
than 240 years, until 1865, in the 13 original 
colonies and the United States, there were 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1693 

men, women, and children forced to labor in 
bondage and bought and sold as property. It 
is a dark and shameful historic truth that this 
Nation must acknowledge and seek to remedy. 
Those who were enslaved and those who 
owned slaves have all passed away long ago. 
Yet, the historic legacy and pain of slavery is 
a reality we continue to struggle with as a nation. 


As slavery evolved into racial segregation, a 
new pain and hardship was inflicted upon African-
Americans. While far less severe than 
slavery, it was no less degrading and demoralizing. 
This is also a painful historical legacy 
we have rejected as a nation. Still, this legacy 
took place in my lifetime and should be remembered, 
reflected upon, and aggressively 
attacked when it reemerges ‘‘officially’’ in our 
cities, neighborhoods and schools. 

This resolution is courageous and correct. I 
commend Mr. COHEN, its author, because it is 
meaningful for the U.S. House of Representatives 
to make this public apology. As a former 
social studies teacher, I taught my students 
that we cannot change history, but we must 
learn from history and use its lessons to make 
the future better for all mankind. Respect, tolerance 
and the elimination of prejudice and 
racism are actions we can take as individuals 
and as a society today. 

We have an opportunity today and everyday, 
as lawmakers here in Congress and as 
citizens across this country, to recommit ourselves 
to seek an end to racial inequality and 
injustice, and to seek greater unity among all 
Americans. To keep moving forward towards 
racial equality in America requires recognizing 
past injustice and to this end, I urge my colleagues 
to support this resolution.

AMERICAN HOUSING RESCUE AND 

FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT 

OF 2008 

HON. TODD TIAHRT 

OF KANSAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, owning a 
home is an essential component of the American 
dream, and an accomplishment that millions 
of Americans aspire to and take pride in. 
In recent months, however, the housing market 
has entered a slump. The effort to provide 
a way for all Americans to own their own 
homes brought a sharp increase in the usage 
of subprime and exotic mortgages, which 
proved to be more than the market could handle. 
We now find ourselves grappling with decisions 
on how best to ‘‘fix’’ the problems that 
have arisen in the housing market and in our 
economy. 

However, a potential $300 billion Government 
handout, such as what has been proposed 
in this legislation, is not the answer. 
Congress has been given a real opportunity to 
reform Government Sponsored Enterprises, 
GSEs, and eliminate the threat to the housing 
market. Unfortunately, however, the authors of 
this legislation have chosen to reject real reforms 
and instead only include ridiculous 
amounts of bailout spending. By extending an 
unlimited line of credit to Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac until 2009, we are placing American 
taxpayers at risk by absorbing the losses 
of these for-profit institutions. The bill further 

institutes a tax on the very GSEs that we are 
being asked to prop up, and allows that 
money—an estimated $9 billion over 10 
years—to be given to supposed ‘‘housing and 
development’’ groups that have been shown to 
participate in illegal and unethical activities, 
such as widespread voter fraud. The Congressional 
Budget Office, CBO, has estimated that 
the expected value of the Federal budgetary 
cost from enacting this proposal would be $25 
billion over fiscal years 2009 and 2010, but 
that this figure could rise into the hundreds of 
billions of dollars. I believe this legislation will 
further exacerbate our nation’s rising deficit 
and further weaken our already ‘‘weak dollar.’’ 

While there is no doubt the housing slump 
must be addressed, I am concerned by the 
precedent of using taxpayer dollars to bail out 
fraudulent lenders and, in some cases, irresponsible 
borrowers. Congress can enact responsible, 
market-based legislation to address 
our housing needs. I fully support FHA and 
GSE reform measures, yet I cannot support a 
massive bailout to irresponsible lending practices 
and market speculators. For these reasons, 
I voted against H.R. 3221. 

I remain committed to supporting measures 
that provide the necessary relief to families 
who have been victimized without burdening 
taxpayers for the irresponsibility of others. 
Therefore, I have given my support to two alternative 
bills introduced before the House of 
Representatives that precisely address the 
needs of homeowners in a responsible and 
fair way. 

First, H.R. 5974, the Housing Opportunity 
for All Americans Act of 2008, addresses the 
housing slump in a responsible way. For instance, 
this bill does not include $300 billion in 
funding to the Federal Housing Authority. Instead 
of providing a massive bailout to irresponsible 
lenders and borrowers, this legislation 
creates a market incentive approach to 
the housing slump. The market approach includes 
a one-time tax credit for homebuyers of 
10 percent of the home’s purchase price, up 
to $10,000, for 1 year after the enactment of 
the bill. Also, under this legislation, taxpayers 
who are nonresident aliens, those who flip a 
home within the 1 year period, or people who 
sell a house to a relative simply for the credit, 
would not be eligible. Furthermore, mortgages 
which exceed the maximum original principal 
obligation of a mortgage Freddie Mac will purchase 
would not qualify. 

Second, the Homeownership Protection and 
Housing Market Stabilization Act of 2008, H.R. 
5857, is a more responsible approach to addressing 
the current issues facing the housing 
market and the underlying causes of the problem. 
The bill includes provisions to directly 
protect homebuyers and owners, such as 
housing counseling, improved disclosure practices, 
fraud combating and prevention measures, 
and encouragement to rework loans instead 
of foreclosing. It also aims to help prevent 
lenders from falling into the same habits 
that have recently developed in the industry by 
providing liability protection for helping troubled 
borrowers, requiring escrow accounts for 
subprime borrowers, and reforming appraisal 
practices for prospective homebuyers. In addition, 
this legislation contains provisions similar 
to those that have passed this House with my 
support: FHA modernization and improved 
regulation of GSEs, including Fannie Mae, 
Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan 
Banks. 

These alternative bills provide the integrity 
of the appraisal process and strengthen mortgage 
fraud prevention efforts that will help 
bring stability to the current housing market. 
These bills together represent a viable alternative, 
offering an appropriate response to a 
serious problem without burdening taxpayers 
for the irresponsibility of others. I hope this 
body has the chance to consider these important 
provisions in the immediate future.

CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4137, 

HIGHER EDUCATION OPPOR


TUNITY ACT 

SPEECH OF 

HON. RUSH D. HOLT 

OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the State of the Union had under 
consideration the bill (H.R. 4137) to amend 
and extend the Higher Education Act of 1965, 
and for other purposes. 

Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I would like to 
commend Chairman MILLER and Mr. MCKEON 
for producing a strong piece of legislation. The 
Higher Education Opportunity Act does what 
the name suggests. It expands affordability 
and access to college education for the broadest 
range of Americans. It expands Pell 
Grants, the basis of financial aid, and I’m 
pleased to say it allows Pell Grants to be used 
year round and for certificate programs and 
part-time students, something I have been 
working on for a long time. 

This Act will help bring transparency and accountability 
to student loan programs by requiring 
institutions of higher education and 
lenders to adopt strict codes of conduct, and 
protects students from aggressive marketing 
practices by lenders. It will provide students 
with full information about their borrowing options 
when taking out loans, and help promote 
financial literacy for students and their parents. 

This legislation will help streamline the Free 
Application for Federal Student Aid, FAFSA, 
and encourage the Department of Education 
to coordinate with the IRS to use information 
that the Government already has. It as well 
expands the access for low-income families to 
student aid with an easy to use two-page 
FAFSA-EZ form. Additionally, the bill strengthens 
the TRIO and GEAR UP college readiness 
programs for first-generation and low-income 
students. 

One of the complaints I hear most from students 
and their parents is about the ever-increasing 
cost of college textbooks. This bill will 
help make textbook costs more manageable 
by ensuring students know the price of textbooks 
in advance so they can plan for the expense. 
And it requires colleges and faculty 
members to have access to the textbook costs 
when making selections for their courses. 

The bill also builds on our work to restore 
the full benefits of the GI Bill to our Nation’s 
veterans, by creating a new scholarship program 
for active duty military personnel and 
family members. It also establishes support 
centers to help veterans succeed in college 
and ensures fairness for veterans in student 
aid decisions. 

I am pleased that this bill will help colleges 
recruit, retain, and graduate students with disabilities. 
The legislation will also help colleges 


E1694 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

improve their facilities and educational materials 
for these students. Further, it will establish 
a national center to provide support services 
and best practices to colleges to best 
serve students with disabilities and their families. 


The legislation also responds to the tragedy 
at Virginia Tech by helping colleges to develop 
and implement state-of-the-art emergency systems 
and campus safety plans. Following a 
recommendation from college campus safety 
directors, the bill creates a National Center for 
Campus Safety to work in collaboration with 
the COPS program. 

The bill also contains provisions, which I 
wrote into the measure, to strengthen our 
workforce and our Nation’s competitiveness. 

The bill would implement my initiative to 
provide loan forgiveness for STEM (Science, 
Technology, Engineering, or Math) employees 
who work in those fields. My initiative also establishes 
a loan forgiveness program for foreign 
language specialists who work as teachers 
or Government employees. 

The legislation creates a Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for International and Foreign Language 
Education in the Department of Education. 
Based on legislation that I wrote, the 
executive-level officer would provide leadership 
in directing efforts aimed at international 
and foreign language education. 

The measure establishes a program that I 
championed, the Science and Technology Advanced 
Foreign Language Grants program, to 
award funding to institutions of higher education 
to create programs that encourage students 
to develop foreign language proficiency 
as well as science and technological knowledge. 


Based on my work, the bill develops the 
Mathematics & Science Scholars Program to 
grants and loan forgiveness to math and 
science students who commit to 5 consecutive 
years of service in a math or science field 
after graduation. 

Included in the bill is my legislation to establish 
a National STEM Database to provide students 
with information on financial assistance 
for postsecondary and graduate programs in 
science, technology, engineering and mathematics. 
This important database will help capable 
students who are interested in STEM 
careers find scholarships to support their studies. 


I am pleased that the measure includes the 
‘‘Preparing Teachers for Digital Age Learners’’ 
program to help teacher candidates effectively 
integrate technology in the classroom. The 
program, which I advocated for, would work 
with teaching candidates on how they can 
bring modern digital tools in the classroom. 

Additionally, the bill incorporates my legislation, 
the Nursing School Capacity Act, which 
requires the Institute of Medicine to explore 
the constraints that the Nation’s schools of 
nursing face and propose short and long term 
solutions to address the nursing crisis. 

Finally, based on my efforts the bill improves 
The ‘‘Child Care Access Means Parents 
in Schools’’ Program to empower small 
and community colleges to provide child care 
to working mothers so they can attend school. 

Each of these provisions and the many 
more contained in the final Act will have positive 
impacts on our Nation and I am pleased 
that they soon will be implemented into law. 

ENERGY COSTS 

HON. HENRY E. BROWN, JR. 

OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, today the House leaves on its 5 
week vacation just like we do every year. 
Generally we are joined by millions of American 
families as they get out of town before 
the start of the school year, but this year 
things are different. While we are still leaving 
Washington, more of these families than ever 
before are staying home, prevented from visiting 
places like the beaches and historic sites 
in my district because of rising energy costs. 
But we aren’t doing anything about it. 

And when school starts up again, students 
are going to see activities cut back because 
their school districts are having to move 
money from these important programs just to 
keep running their school buses. High energy 
costs are having a dramatic impact on every 
part of our society. But Congress is failing to 
address them. 

Today, news came out that American employers 
shed some 51,000 jobs last month, 
and for so many companies, the burden of 
high energy prices are behind so many of 
these job losses. From steel mills to fertilizer 
plants and delivery services, I could list countless 
businesses that use energy not only to 
keep the lights on but as the fuel for getting 
their job done. And record high energy prices 
are fighting their best efforts to grow our economy. 
But we can’t even have a vote on accessing 
more American energy. 

Madam Speaker, I want to take a moment 
to highlight some of these businesses being 
impacted by today’s high energy prices. I represent 
a coastal district where many of my 
constituents make their living on the water. 
The heart of my district are its shrimpers, tour 
boat operators, recreational and commercial 
fishermen. 

However, many of these hard-working residents 
of coastal South Carolina cannot even 
afford to take their boats on the water anymore 
because of all-time record high prices for 
fuel. Shrimpers must catch 700 pounds a day 
just to fuel their boats—I can assure you, this 
is not a small catch. 

Before Speaker PELOSI ‘‘saves the planet’’ 
here in Washington, DC, perhaps she can 
come down to Charleston or McClellanville in 
South Carolina and explain to the these hard-
working men and women why she is refusing 
to schedule a vote to increase domestic energy 
production and lower the cost of their diesel 
fuel to allow them to get back on the 
water. Their struggles are not a hoax. 

Madam Speaker, we currently depend on 
foreign and in many cases unfriendly nations 
for over 60 percent of our Nation’s energy 
needs. This is a serious national security concern 
for my constituents in coastal South 
Carolina that is only getting worse. It is sad to 
see that every other country in the world views 
its energy resources as a strategic asset; in 
the United States we have come to view ours 
as an environmental liability. 

Madam Speaker, this week I was proud to 
join with a group of Republicans and Democrats 
to introduce legislation that was written 
together that would allow us to start domestic 
energy production while also investing in many 

types of renewable energy. When will we get 
a vote on the bipartisan National Environment, 
Conservation and Energy Independence Act 
or any of the other pieces of legislation that 
offer an ‘‘all of the above’’ solution to our energy 
crisis? 

While we may leave Washington today, we 
cannot leave our responsibility to address this 
issue for the American people.

HANNAH WARFIELD AND JENNY 
BARRINGER 

HON. ED PERLMUTTER 

OF COLORADO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize two members of one of my 
Colorado offices, Hannah Warfield and Jenny 
Barringer. 

These two are world-class athletes, from my 
alma mater, the University of Colorado, who 
recently competed in the U.S. Olympic track 
and field trials in Eugene, Oregon. 

I want to start off by saying a few words 
about Hannah, a native of Sydney, Montana 
who competed in the Women’s javelin competition. 


Her work ethic is extraordinary. 

Despite the rigors of a working a full time 
job, and recently graduating from the University 
of Colorado, she maintained a training 
schedule that would begin at 5 a.m. in the 
morning and would humble even the most 
dedicated among us. 

This work ethic propelled her to become the 
2007 NCAA Women’s Big Twelve Champion 
in the Javelin event. 

A distinction not achieved by a University of 
Colorado athlete in 20 years. 

She is one of the most pleasant, organized 
and courteous individuals I have ever had the 
opportunity to meet. 

Although, Hannah came just short of making 
it to Beijing, words cannot express the amount 
of pride and inspiration she brought to our office 
and our community with her dedication to 
the pursuit of her dreams. 

Hannah’s positive attitude and tenacity 
should serve as inspiration to all of us. 

Next, I would like to take a moment to 
speak about Jenny Barringer, from Oviedo, 
Florida, who competed in the women’s 3,000m 
steeplechase event. 

Jenny is a true pioneer in the sport, which 
is making its inaugural appearance at the 
2008 games. 

She recently shattered the American record 
in the women’s steeplechase with a time of 
9:22.73. 

If that were not enough, she maintains a 3.7 
GPA, serves as a sign language interpreter, 
volunteers with the Ronald McDonald House, 
Habitat for Humanity, and the local adopt-a-
road program. 

I can attest that Coloradans will be watching 
with immense pride in the coming weeks as 
Jenny goes for the gold in the Beijing. 

What impresses me most about Hannah 
and Jenny is that for as great as their athletic 
ability, they’re ever better people. 

Active in their communities, great students 
combined with a desire to go above and beyond 
what is expected, they serve as a positive 
example of what can be achieved with 
hard work and a positive attitude. 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1695 

As a father of three extraordinary women 
myself, all of whom are athletes, I can attest 
Hannah and Jenny represent the pride that 
every parent who drops their kids off at an 
athletic practice or attends one of their competitions 
feels. 

It is an amazing honor to see two of our 
own in Colorado rise to this level, especially 
knowing it could not have happened to two 
better people. 

Hannah Warfield and Jenny Barringer embody 
the best our country could hope for in 
the next generation of Americans. 

I am privileged for the opportunity to have 
come to know these two remarkable individuals. 


I would like to close by saying go USA, and 
go Jenny in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN PHIL RUHLE 

HON. PATRICK J. KENNEDY 

OF RHODE ISLAND 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express my sympathies to a wonderful 
Rhode Island family who has lost a devoted 
loved one: Captain Phil Ruhle of North 
Kingstown, Rhode Island. 

Captain Ruhle was a life-long professional 
fisherman and the captain of the Sea Breeze 
that capsized off the coast of New Jersey last 
Wednesday night. He was the center of 5 generations 
of fishermen, including his grandfather, 
his father, his brother, his son, and 
grandson. 

In recent years, Captain Ruhle took an active 
role in work to improve industry conditions 
for fishermen. He was even awarded NOAA’s 
Environmental Hero Award in 2003 for his 
‘‘tireless efforts to preserve and protect our 
Nation’s environment.’’ Captain Ruhle was instrumental 
in developing the innovative ‘‘Eliminator’’ 
net, which will benefit fishermen and 
our environment for generations. 

Captain Ruhle was valued as an intelligent 
and passionate advocate and adviser for fishermen 
across the country. His presence, especially 
his familiar voice, will be missed by 
his fellow fishermen, by Federal fishing regulators 
and by all who cared about the future of 
the fishing industry. 

I share in the sorrow at the loss of Captain 
Ruhle with his wife Donna, his mother Gloria, 
his children Phil, Jr., Roger and Alicia, all his 
grandchildren and his many friends and colleagues. 
While this is a sad time for all of us, 
we take solace in knowing that Captain Ruhle 
lived his life to the fullest and left behind him 
a world which, because of his life, was kinder, 
more passionate and more generous.

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH: OUR SENIORS 
AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES 
DESERVE A RELIABLE, AFFORDABLE 
AND UNIVERSAL RX 
BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE! 

HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, the insurance 
and pharmaceutical industry-friendly 

Medicare Part D drug benefit is, as predicted, 
costing taxpayers billions of unnecessary dollars, 
restricting access to needed pharmaceuticals, 
and providing windfall profits for the 
pharmaceutical companies. Last week, the 
Oversight and Government Reform Committee 
released an analysis that showed that pharmaceuticals 
covered under Part D cost 30 percent 
more than pharmaceuticals provided 
through Medicaid. Medicaid’s program is administered 
by the Federal Government while 
Medicare Part D uses private insurance companies. 
As you know, it also provides no authority 
to negotiate prices, no other meaningful 
cost mechanisms, and a paltry benefit for far 
too many enrollees to boot. 

A report by the Center for Economic and 
Policy Research showed that a benefit administered 
by Medicare would save enough 
money to fully cover prescription drug costs 
between 2006 and 2013 and still have $40 billion 
left over. 

For our seniors and for our children and 
grandchildren’s future security, I urge you to 
reaffirm your support for one of the most successful 
social programs in our Nation’s history 
by calling for a comprehensive and meaningful 
prescription drug benefit under Medicare, and 
one which addresses the outrageously high 
prices of prescription drugs paid by American 
consumers. 

I have introduced a bill that will replace the 
current plan with a benefit that provides seniors 
and people with disabilities with the drugs 
they need with no co-pay, no premium and no 
deductible. Every person would receive the 
same voluntary benefit, regardless of income 
or geographical location, just like traditional 
Medicare. 

How can the plan provide such a strong 
benefit without busting the budget? By including 
provisions that seriously address the outrageously 
high prices Americans are forced to 
pay for prescription drugs. 

First, the plan will include strong, loophole-
free language to allow American pharmacists, 
wholesalers and distributors to purchase FDA-
approved prescription drugs at lower prices 
abroad. With strong reimportation language 
like that included in this plan, all Americans— 
not just seniors—could save 30–70 percent on 
the price of prescription drugs without any 
Government subsidy. 

Second, the bill also allows Medicare to negotiate 
on behalf of all Medicare beneficiaries, 
something prohibited under the current Republican 
program, which could achieve discounts 
comparable to the significant discounts received 
by the Veterans Administration. 

Finally, the plan would ensure that when 
taxpayers foot the bill for research and development 
of a prescription drug, the pharmaceutical 
industry must offer that drug at a fair 
and reasonable price. Such a requirement has 
passed the House by a wide bipartisan majority 
in the past, only to be stripped out by the 
pharmaceutical industry in conference committee. 
Today, the taxpayer-funded National 
Institutes of Health continues to spend tens of 
billions of dollars a year on research and development 
of medicines. Most often, this R&D 
is then handed over to the pharmaceutical industry, 
whose member companies charge 
Americans any price they want for the final 
product. If we change this absurd system, we 
would ensure that new medicines would be affordable 
in the years ahead. 

As the current crisis makes all too clear, the 
time has come to support a comprehensive 

prescription drug benefit for seniors and people 
with disabilities that does not coddle the 
health insurance or pharmaceutical industries.

PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT 

SPEECH OF 

HON. RUSH D. HOLT 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the State of the Union had under 
consideration the bill (H.R. 1338) to amend 
the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide 
more effective remedies to victims of 
discrimination in the payment of wages on 
the basis of sex, and for other purposes. 

Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today as a 
co-sponsor of H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness 
Act. 

Last week, I had the honor of participating 
in a portrait unveiling ceremony for former 
New Jersey Representative Mary Norton, who 
was the chair of the Labor Committee 70 
years ago and a tireless advocate for equal 
pay. Under her leadership Congress passed 
1938 Fair Labor Standards Act that established 
the 40-hour workweek, outlawed child 
labor and established a minimum wage of 25 
cents per hour. I think of her today when I say 
that while we have made significant progress 
since the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the fight for 
equality in the workplace is far from over. According 
to the U.S. Census Bureau, women 
still earn only 77 percent as much as men on 
average. These statistics are worse for women 
of color; African-American women earn only 

71.7 cents and Latinas only 58.5 cents for 
every dollar earned by their male counterparts. 
Unfortunately, this wage gap only increases 
over time and has lasting effects on the lives 
of our working women. While women 1 year 
out of college earn 80 percent of what their 
male peers make, by the time women are 10 
years out of college they are making only 69 
percent of what men do. Furthermore, after a 
lifetime of receiving lower wages, older women 
are less likely than older men to receive pension 
income, and when they do they receive 


E1696 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

only half of the benefits that men receive. It is 
then sad, but unsurprising, that women represent 
70 percent of older adults living in poverty. 


Mary Norton understood that the wage gap 
is not just a women’s issue—it is a family 
issue. When women earn less for equal work, 
families are forced to do more with less. Affording 
all of life’s expenses is challenging 
enough—it shouldn’t be made harder as a result 
of women being shortchanged on payday. 

I believe that there is more that can and 
should be done to level the playing field and 
provide fair opportunities for women in education 
and the workplace. I would like to commend 
my colleague from Connecticut, Representative 
ROSA DELAURO, for introducing 

H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act. This 
bill would strengthen the Equal Pay Act and 
close loopholes that allow employers to avoid 
responsibility for discriminatory pay and prohibit 
employers from retaliating against employees 
who discuss salary information with 
their co-workers. It would also create a training 
program to strengthen women’s negotiation 
skills and establish additional avenues for 
women to seek equal pay in the workplace. 
This legislation is long overdue and I urge 
my colleagues to support it.

INTRODUCTION OF A RESOLUTION 

TO RECOGNIZE THE US 36 COR


RIDOR PROJECT 

HON. MARK UDALL 

OF COLORADO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, 
today I am introducing a resolution to recognize 
the benefits of the United States Route 
36, US 36, Corridor project plan, and to commend 
the cooperative effort of several communities 
located along the US 36 Corridor between 
Denver and Boulder in developing the 
project. 

The Colorado communities along the US 36 
Corridor, including Westminster, Louisville, Superior, 
Broomfield, Denver, and Boulder, are 
experiencing a tremendous period of expansion. 
While this growth is very positive and 
certainly welcome, it has also outpaced the 
growth of its transportation infrastructure, leading 
to heavy traffic delays and sometimes dangerous 
road conditions. 

In response to these conditions, the US 36 
Mayors and Commissioners Coalition, MCC, a 
coalition of officials representing the communities 
along the US 36 Corridor, in coordination 
with the Colorado Department of Transportation, 
CDOT, and a coalition of local businesses 
known as 36 Commuting Solutions, 
developed the US 36 Corridor project plan. 

The US 36 Corridor project is a national 
model for congestion mitigation, combining 
bus rapid transit lanes, high-occupancy vehicle 
lanes and safe bicycling lanes with traditional 
auto traffic lanes. The project ranked among 
the highest congestion mitigation proposals 
submitted under the Department of Transportation’s 
Urban Partnership Agreement Program, 
and a record of decision is expected to 
be issued next year that will allow for its construction 
to commence. 

Madam Speaker, I think the cooperation and 
ingenuity that was demonstrated in putting the 

US 36 Corridor project together, as well as the 
project’s benefits, deserve recognition from 
Congress, as this resolution does.

INTRODUCTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE 
BRANCH PERSONNEL APPEALS 
PROCEDURAL CONSOLIDATION 
ACT 

HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 

OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today I am 
introducing the Legislative Branch Personnel 
Appeals Procedural Consolidation Act of 2008 
to bring the GAO in line with other legislative 
branch agencies and to address an important 
issue of equal rights at Government Accountability 
Office, GAO, after extensive consultation 
with all concerned. Over the past year my 
office has worked closely with the Committee 
on Oversight and Government Reform to resolve 
serious employee wage and discrimination 
disputes at the GAO. African Americans, 
and older employees who have been disproportionately 
affected by these disputes and 
have complained that discrimination cases at 
GAO must be heard internally, the only grievance 
system where Federal employee charges 
of discrimination are processed and determined 
within a Federal agency without any 
independent review. This bill resolves this 
unique conflict of interest and due process 
issue that allows GAO to render the final administrative 
decisions on discrimination, labor 
and other issues against the GAO with the 
agency head appointing all the decision-
makers in the process and no review by any 
disinterested or third-party agency official. 

The wage disputes and complaints about 
the grievance system began when the GAO 
implemented dramatic and controversial pay-
for-performance revisions to classify and pay 
its employees. The Comptroller General assured 
GAO employees that the annual COLAs 
that Congress votes for all federal employees 
would not be affected. However, many employees, 
including a disproportionate number 
of African Americans, did not receive their 
COLAs for FY06 and FY07, though all had ratings 
of ‘‘meets expectations’’ or above. 

Consequently, GAO employees filed formal 
race and age discrimination complaints 
against the Comptroller General with the Personnel 
Appeals Board, PAB, which hears all 
such complaints. The PAB members are appointed 
by the Comptroller General to decide 
not only discrimination cases based on race, 
sex, age and religion, but also cases involving 
violations of labor, and of civil service or merit 
system rights. All other Federal and legislative 
branch employees carry employee complaints 
to independent agencies. 

It was the excellent work of Chairman 
DANNY K. DAVIS and the Federal Workforce 
subcommittee, whose hearings uncovered the 
discriminatory effects of the pay system and 
negotiated back-COLA payments for all GAO 
employees. An independent assessment by 
the Ivy Group, hired by GAO after the watchdog 
organization, Blacks In Government, recommended 
a study of discrimination at the 
GAO, showed that there are many race-based 
disparities in ratings, promotions and other 
employment practices between African Amer


ican and Caucasian analysts at the GAO. For 
example, having a PhD has a statistically significant 
positive effect for Caucasian analysts, 
but has no effect for African American analysts, 
and Caucasian analysts receive a ratings 
benefit from being assigned to lead roles 
on projects, contrasted with African American 
analysts, who show no statistically significant 
effect of being assigned to such roles. 

This bill provides for independent review of 
complaints by transferring jurisdiction to the 
OOC, which handles such matters for all other 
legislative branch employees. The OOC represents 
the most recent bipartisan thinking 
and action of Congress concerning equal 
treatment for employees of the legislative 
branch. Because of the small case loads generated 
by legislative branch agencies, the 
OOC is able to handle the broadest enforcement 
mandate of any executive or legislative 
agency and currently enforces 12 different employee 
protection laws and is the only employee 
protection agency required by statute 
to continuously review new laws and incorporate 
them into its own jurisdiction. 

The bill does not assign responsibilities to 
an agency beyond its expertise and does not 
put additional responsibility on the congressional 
leadership to make appointments. The 
OOC has indicated the feasibility of its participation 
and offered evidence that the statute 
that established the OOC contemplates granting 
additional authority to the OOC of the kind 
we seek. 

I hope all my colleagues join me in assuring 
equal rights to GAO employees.

INTRODUCTION OF THE VIRGINIA 
OCS BILL 

HON. BOB GOODLATTE 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Speaker, each 
week, folks across Virginia and the Nation are 
confronted with the rising cost of energy, from 
the cost at the pump to soaring electric bills. 
Energy is vital to every sector of our economy, 
including homes, small businesses and industries. 
When energy supplies are tight, families 
and businesses are severely impacted by the 
resulting increase in energy costs. 

While the majority has succeeded in strangling 
any efforts to tap into traditional energy 
resources in America, our Nation’s citizens 
have suffered. They have suffered with skyrocketing 
gas and food prices, and they have 
suffered from the fear that we are ever dependent 
on foreign, and sometimes hostile, 
sources of oil. 

While the leadership of the majority in Congress 
can’t seem to get its act together to 
solve this problem for the Nation, as a representative 
of the people of Virginia, I cannot 
stand by and simply watch this spectacle. The 
time for action is now. 

Virginians understand that a major component 
in lessening energy costs is to produce 
more energy. In fact the topic of energy production 
on Virginia’s Outer Continental Shelf, 
OCS, has received serious discussion by the 
Virginia General Assembly. I believe that Virginia 
should have every tool available to access 
its energy supplies. Unfortunately, a congressional 
moratorium on exploration of the 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1697 

OCS prevents the Commonwealth from having 
every tool available to address rising energy 
costs. 

Therefore, I rise to introduce legislation to 
allow Virginia to request oil and natural gas 
exploration activities off its coast. Should 
these exploration activities prove fruitful, then 
the legislation would allow Virginia to petition 
for drilling for these precious resources. This 
bill does not mandate that Virginia explore or 
drill off its coast. It simply removes the Federal 
Government’s longstanding barriers to these 
activities. The final decision of whether to explore 
or drill is placed squarely where it should 
be—in the hands of the people of Virginia, 
through their State legislature and Governor. 

This legislation is not a cure all, and it does 
not fix the problem all across the country. 
However, Virginia’s two Senators, one from 
each political party, have introduced similar 
legislation over in the Senate, and this is 
promising. In order to demonstrate how broad 
the support is for allowing States to decide 
this issue for themselves, I would encourage 
Members from all States to introduce similar 
legislation until a threshold of support is 
achieved that breaks the Democrat leadership’s 
logjam on this issue and allows the will 
of the American people to be heard.

HONORING BROTHER W.L. BAKER 

AS HE CELEBRATES HIS 100TH 

BIRTHDAY 

HON. JIM COOPER 

OF TENNESSEE 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. COOPER. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor Brother W.L. Baker, a fine citizen and 
leader in Wilson County, Tennessee, on the 
occasion of his 100th birthday, August 3, 
2008. 

Brother Baker has served God as a Baptist 
minister for more than 80 years, preaching to 
all in earshot and ministering to all in need. In 
recent years, in his so-called retirement, 
Brother Baker has actively served several congregations 
across Wilson County. Even today, 
he is an associate pastor at Calvary Baptist 
Church and has been honored as the oldest 
living graduate of Cumberland University. 

Madam Speaker, it gives me great pride to 
represent someone as selfless, as dedicated 
to God and fellow man, and as full of life as 
Brother W.L. Baker. In his actions, he serves 
as a role model for Americans everywhere 
and for all of us in the 110th Congress. We 
are a better people because of his 100 years 
among us. I ask you to join me in wishing him 
heartfelt congratulations on his birthday; may 
he have many more years of peace, gratitude 
and prosperity.

HONORING DR. HERBERT R. FISCH


ER FOR 37 YEARS OF ACHIEVE


MENTS IN EDUCATION 

HON. JERRY LEWIS 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend and 

true leader in my community, Dr. Herbert R. 
Fischer, who is retiring after 37 years of dedication 
to educational development and public 
service throughout the Inland Empire. 

After 27 years as a classroom teacher, principal, 
and district administrator in the San 
Bernardino City Unified School District and as 
superintendent of the Colton Joint Unified 
School District, Dr. Fischer was chosen to be 
the San Bernardino County Superintendent of 
Schools, a position he held for 10 years. 

The San Bernardino County Superintendent 
of Schools office provides support to the 33 
K–12 districts and roughly 425,000 students 
attending more than 500 schools in the county. 
The County Schools office also provides 
business and financial curriculum and instruction, 
personnel, credentials, and management 
information support to school districts county-
wide. 

Our district is privileged to have many fine 
educational professionals dedicated to improve 
the overall well-being of their students. 
Dr Fischer is no exception and has taken his 
love for educational development even further. 
Under Dr. Fischer’s leadership, the County 
Superintendent of Schools office has improved 
the State Academic performance index for 7 
consecutive years. He has expanded many 
school safety programs through the Law Enforcement 
Education Partnership and the 
Countywide Gangs and Drugs Task Force. Dr. 
Fischer is also a founder of three regional P– 
16 Councils that work to eliminate the 
achievement gap by creating a comprehensive 
system for all levels of education. 

Dr. Fischer’s forward thinking has made San 
Bernardino a model for excellence in community 
service. In particular, he is credited with 
developing and implementing Alliance for Education 
initiative, which has over 1,200 business, 
labor, community and faith-based partners 
working with public schools to improve 
the college, career and labor readiness of students. 


Throughout his career in education, Dr. 
Fischer worked with colleagues, students and 
parents, to increase college going rates, reduce 
student drop-out rates, and provide 
greater Internet and technology access to students 
and teachers. He also established programs 
to provide quality curriculums for all 
students and offer parents more educational 
choices. Dr. Fischer’s hard work and dedication 
to the future success of our young people 
is truly appreciated. 

Madam Speaker, please join me in congratulating 
Dr. Fischer for his many accomplishments 
and thanking him for making our 
community a leader in educational and professional 
advancement. The valuable contributions 
he has made throughout his career will 
be remembered for years to come.

INTRODUCING THE HEALTH CARE 
FOR WOMEN RESOLUTION 

HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to introduce the Health Care for Women Resolution 
of 2008 with my colleague in the Senate, 
Senator DEBBIE STABENOW. As we move 
towards enacting comprehensive Universal 

Health Care we cannot leave out the important 
and unique health care issues of women. 
Women are often responsible for safeguarding 
the care for their families and they must be a 
central part of every universal health care debate. 


I believe that the Health Care for Women 
Resolution recognizes the numerous of 
women as health care decision makers, caregivers 
and providers and requires that lawmakers 
acknowledge their needs during health 
care reform conversations. 

We know that women face exceptional challenges 
and have a very personal stake in fixing 
our broken health care system. It is unacceptable 
that more women are uninsured and 
pay more for health care than their male counterparts. 
This resolution calls on Congress to 
take notice of these obstacles and make significant 
gains in solving these problems. 

This resolution asks Congress to pass legislation 
within 18 months that provides health 
care for women and health care for all. I am 
all too familiar with how tough it is to provide 
care for our families. As a mother, grandmother 
and member of Congress, I will fight to 
make sure that women play a central part in 
every health care discussion. 

The need for this resolution is clear. More 
than 17 million non-elderly women were uninsured 
in 2006, an increase of 1.2 million 
women since 2004. Women also pay 68 percent 
more than men for out-of-pocket medical 
costs, largely because of their reproductive 
health needs. Thirteen percent of all pregnant 
women are uninsured making them less likely 
to seek prenatal care and more likely to experience 
an adverse outcome after giving birth or 
pregnancy-related mortality. 

Older women are particularly at risk. They 
often receive care through their husband and 
can become uninsured if their husband dies or 
loses private insurance by becoming eligible 
for Medicare. Because they have less disposable 
income, older women also have trouble 
paying growing out-of-pocket costs for the 
care they need. Moreover many older women 
have periodically left the workforce to raise 
families or care for aging family members they 
tend to have lower Social Security and pension 
benefits required to help them with increasing 
chronic care conditions. 

Any health care discussions must also take 
into account the barriers women of color face 
in accessing quality care. Hispanic and Native 
American women and children are 3 times and 
African Americans nearly twice as likely to be 
uninsured that non-Hispanic whites. 

I along with 32 of my colleagues in both the 
House and Senate agree, it is time to start acknowledging 
women in all efforts that we 
make to solve our nation’s growing health care 
crisis. 

I urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor this 
important legislation.

PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT 

SPEECH OF 

HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 

OF MINNESOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 31, 2008 

The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the State of the Union had under 
consideration the bill (H.R. 1338) to amend 


E1698 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide 
more effective remedies to victims of 
discrimination in the payment of wages on 
the basis of sex, and for other purposes. 

Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, 
I rise today in strong support of the Paycheck 
Fairness Act (H.R. 1338). This is a historic 
day in the fight for equal rights for 
women, and I would like to thank Speaker 
PELOSI, Congresswoman DELAURO, and Chairman 
MILLER for their leadership in this issue. 

Women have made great strides in the 
American workplace during the last quarter 
century. Women are now more likely to have 
advanced degrees, own businesses, and 
make up nearly half the workforce. When Congresswoman 
NANCY PELOSI was sworn in as 
Speaker of the House, women and young girls 
were inspired to know that there is no job a 
woman in this country cannot do. As we send 
our young female graduates into the workforce 
we must ensure that they receive equal pay 
for equal work. 

Although the wage gap has narrowed since 
the passage of the landmark Equal Pay Act in 
1963, gender-based wage discrimination remains 
a problem for women in the workforce. 
It is unacceptable that women continue to 
earn just 77 cents for every dollar earned by 
men, and pay disparity can be even worse for 
minority women. This wage disparity will cost 
women anywhere from $400,000 to $2 million 
over a lifetime in lost wages. Furthermore, the 
wage disparity grows wider as women age 
and threatens their economic security, retirement, 
and quality of life. 

The Paycheck Fairness Act will make commonsense 
reforms to strengthen the Equal 
Pay Act and close the loopholes that have allowed 
employers to avoid responsibility for discriminatory 
pay. It would require employers 
seeking to justify unequal pay to bear the burden 
of proving that their actions are justified, 
and allow women to sue for punitive damages. 
This bill would also prohibit employers from retaliating 
against employees who share salary 
information with their co-workers. Finally, it 
would create a training program to help 
women strengthen their negotiation skills, and 
require the Department of Labor to work with 
employers to eliminate pay disparities by enhancing 
outreach and training efforts. 

The Paycheck Fairness Act recognizes that 
equal pay is not only an issue of fairness for 
women, but also one of fairness for working 
families. In these tough economic times, this 
bill could make all the difference for working 
families to make ends meet in their everyday 
lives. Through these efforts we can help give 
families the resources they need to give their 
children a better future. Pay equity should not 
be a benefit that needs to be bargained for, it 
is a promise that the Government must ensure. 


I urge my colleagues to rise in support of 
this bill to ensure economic security for 
women and their families. Through this legislation 
we can ensure a better future for our 
daughters, granddaughters, and generations 
to come. 

HONORING MR. THOMAS LIZIK OF 

INCARNATION CATHOLIC SCHOOL 

ON HIS RETIREMENT 

HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor an outstanding educator in my district, 
Thomas Lizik. This past June, Mr. Lizik 
retired from the Archdiocese of Chicago 
school system after 40 years of distinguished 
service and leadership. His remarkable contributions 
to his students, colleagues, and the 
entire community will always be remembered 
and his presence will be sorely missed. I 
would like to extend my appreciation to Mr. 
Lizik for his decades of dedicated service. 

After receiving a degree in business administration 
from DePaul University in 1968, Mr. 
Lizik began his teaching career at Visitation 
Catholic School in Chicago, IL. He continued 
on to teach at St. Ann Catholic School in Chicago, 
St. Denis School in Chicago, and Incarnation 
School in Palos Heights. Mr. Lizik’s 
awareness of the importance of family, friends, 
integrity, and career is the foundation of his 
professional success, and has led his colleagues 
and students to hold him in the highest 
regard. 

Mr. Lizik’s tireless work has earned him numerous 
awards, including the ‘‘Outstanding 
Teacher Award’’ from St. Ignatius College 
Prep and the ‘‘Most Influential Teacher Award’’ 
from De La Salle High School and Queen of 
Peace High School. In 2002, he was nominated 
for the Golden Apple Award for Excellence 
in Teaching. In addition to these special 
awards, he has also been featured in ‘‘Who’s 
Who Among American Teachers’’ and has 
served as a distinguished member of the Illinois 
Council of Teachers of Mathematics. 

Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring Mr. Thomas Lizik as an outstanding 
educator, and recognize his tireless efforts to 
educate and develop generations of confident, 
responsible, and well-educated students. He 
has done nothing less than an extraordinary 
job in preparing future generations for their 
challenges ahead. I thank and congratulate 
Thomas for his service and dedication and 
wish him a happy, healthy, and fulfilling retirement.

COMMEMORATING THE 1-YEAR AN


NIVERSARY OF THE I–35W 

BRIDGE COLLAPSE 

HON. JOHN KLINE 

OF MINNESOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to commemorate the anniversary of 
a tragedy still fresh in the minds of many Minnesotans. 


Just 1 year ago today, thousands of men, 
women and families were on their way home 
from work and school when calamity struck. 
Without warning, the bridge that so many of 
us took for granted on our daily commutes 
failed, causing physical and emotional pain 
that lingers even today. 

But this anniversary is not entirely solemn. 
Today we also recall the heroic actions of the 
men and women who came to the aid of those 
injured in the collapse. 

The first emergency personnel on the scene 
responded without hesitation, risking their 
health and safety to rescue victims and provide 
medical care to the injured. In the weeks 
and months following the collapse, scores of 
ordinary people became extraordinary citizens 
by rushing to the aid of those in need. 

Madam Speaker, on this somber occasion, 
as we remember the victims of this collapse 
and their families, we also celebrate the selfless 
service of the heroes who came to their 
rescue. Our thoughts and prayers remain with 
all who were affected.

HONORING EDWARD DAY COHOTA, 
JOSEPH L. PIERCE, AND OTHER 
VETERANS OF ASIAN AND PACIFIC 
ISLANDER DESCENT WHO 
FOUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES 
CIVIL WAR 

SPEECH OF 

HON. DAVID WU 

OF OREGON 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Mr. WU. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of H. Res. 415, a resolution to honor 
and recognize veterans of Asian and Pacific 
Islander descent who fought valiantly in the 
United States Civil War. 

Historical research indicates that more than 
250 soldiers of Asian and Pacific Islander descent 
served in both the Union and Confederate 
forces during the Civil War. Mr. Edward 
Day Cohota and Mr. Joseph L. Pierce, both of 
Chinese descent, are the most documented 
and researched of these veterans. 

Mr. Cohota enlisted in the 23rd Regiment, 
Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, in 1864 and 
fought courageously in the Battle of Drury’s 
Bluff, where other soldiers reported that he 
had seven bullet holes in his coat but was not 
wounded. Mr. Cohota continued to serve in 
the U.S. Army for a total of 30 years. 

Mr. Pierce enlisted in the 14th Regiment, 
Connecticut Volunteer Infantry, in 1862 and 
fought in his first battle at Antietam. He further 
distinguished himself in the Battle of Gettysburg, 
and bravely volunteered for a perilous 
attack on Bliss Farm during the day of Pickett’s 
charge. 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1699 

Remarkably, despite the fact that many people 
of Asian and Pacific Islander descent were 
not allowed to naturalize during this period, a 
disproportionately high percentage enlisted to 
fight on both sides of the Civil War. After the 
war, however, scores of these soldiers and 
sailors were unjustly denied their due recognition 
and benefits. 

H. Res. 415 is a long overdue expression of 
appreciation for the loyal service of the Civil 
War veterans of Asian and Pacific Islander 
heritage. The United States House of Representatives 
stands to recognize their contributions 
to our Nation’s history and to speak 
against the injustices done to them despite 
their patriotism and honorable service.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE RETIREMENT 
OF MAJOR GENERAL JEFFREY 
R. REIMER, UNITED 
STATES AIR FORCE 

HON. JEFF MILLER 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. MILLER of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor MG Jeffrey Reimer as he retires 
from the United States Air Force after 34 
years of service. 

A 1974 graduate of the University of Florida, 
Major General Reimer held a variety of important 
assignments in his 34 years of service. As 
the top graduate from his pilot training program 
class, he initially served as an F–4C 
Wild Weasel pilot. Assigned to the Air Training 
Command, he was the top graduate from T– 
37 instructor training and the Instructor Pilot of 
the Year. He has effectively served the Nation 
in numerous positions within the test and acquisition 
community. He was an F–16 acceptance 
test pilot and was selected to attend the 
Air Force Institute of Technology and USAF 
Test Pilot School. As a distinguished graduate 
of the school, he served as an instructor and 
continued his experimental test pilot duties at 
the F–16 Combined Test Force. 

Major General Reimer served in the Office 
of the Secretary of Defense as a military staff 
assistant for developmental testing of aircraft 
and air-to-air missiles. His later assignments 
include: Program manager for the MC–130H 
Combat Talon and program director of special 
programs for the Air-to-Air Joint System Program 
Office. He has commanded the 4953rd 
Test Squadron, Air Force Security Assistance 
Center, and the Air Armament Center. In his 
most recent assignment, Major General 
Reimer served as the Air Force Program Executive 
Officer for the F–22. He saved the taxpayers 
$411 million using a multi-year contract 
to purchase 60 F–22 aircraft. 

On a personal note, I had the pleasure of 
working very closely with Major General 
Reimer when he was Commander of the Air 
Armament Center at Eglin Air Force Base. Together, 
we worked through test facility closure 
and test wing consolidation issues. He provided 
strong leadership and candid assessments 
to Air Force officials which were necessary 
to effectively accomplish the mission. 

Madam Speaker, few can match the dedication 
and professionalism of MG Jeffrey 
Reimer. He is a man of honor and a man of 
principle. In his 34 years of service, he has 
touched the lives of many and our Nation is 

stronger because of his dedicated service. On 
behalf of the United States Congress, I wish to 
thank MG Jeffrey Reimer for his years of dedicated 
service. Vicki and I wish him and his 
family our best wishes for success and happiness 
in the future.

A TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF 
DONALD RAY TOW 

HON. JIM COSTA 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to the life of Donald Ray Tow of 
Selma, California, who recently passed away 
at the age of 74. He leaves behind the love of 
his life of 44 years, Marie, along with 4 children, 
13 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren. 


Mr. Tow was born on June 2, 1934, in 
Checotah, Oklahoma, but was raised in the 
Central Valley. As a teenager Don moved 
from Bakersfield to Selma, California, and 
graduated from Selma High School in 1952. 
Upon graduation from Selma High School he 
attended Reedley College prior to joining the 

U.S. Air Force in 1953. While in the Air Force 
Don proudly served his country in Korea. 
After returning from Korea he continued his 
education at Fresno State College, where he 
received his master’s degree in education. His 
first job was at Eric White Elementary in 
Selma, California, as a sixth grade teacher. 
After teaching for 13 years he went on to become 
a principal at Washington School in 
Kingsburg, California. In 1990, he moved on to 
Roosevelt Junior High, also as a principal. 

He was devoted to his community, serving 
on the Selma Unified School Board, the Selma 
City Council, and most recently as mayor of 
the city of Selma. Mr. Tow not only had a passion 
for education but also for sports and especially 
for baseball. His huge interest in 
sports drew him to coaching in the Selma Little 
League. One of his favorite pastimes was 
family outings to Morro Bay, and Dinkey 
Creek, and watching his grandchildren at their 
sporting events. 

It goes without saying that Mr. Donald Ray 
‘‘Don’’ Tow was an honorable man with a 
commitment to family, friends and the community 
that will forever live in the lives of the people 
he so graciously touched. His passion for 
family, education, and his community will be 
remembered by all who knew him. I am honored 
and humbled to join his family in celebrating 
the life of this amazing man who will 
never be forgotten.

TRIBUTE TO RACHEL JAGODA 
BRUNETTE 

HON. BART GORDON 

OF TENNESSEE 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. GORDON of Tennessee. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize a talented 
individual who has been a dedicated member 
of our committee staff—Rachel Jagoda Brunette. 


Rachel came to the committee at the beginning 
of the 109th Congress as a staff assistant 

for the Republican majority. Her talent was 
quickly recognized, and she was soon promoted 
to professional staff for the research 
subcommittee. As a staffer for that subcommittee, 
she handled math and science 
education issues. 

At the start of this Congress, the committee 
offered positions to several staffers of former 
Chairman Boehlert and we were fortunate that 
Rachel accepted our offer. She moved to the 
Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation 
and deftly transitioned to a broad portfolio of 
technology issues, from Homeland Security 
science and technology to surface transportation 
research and development. 

Her bachelor’s degree in physics from 
Georgetown University and a master’s in political 
management from the George Washington 
University were an excellent foundation for 
navigating the nexus between science and 
policy. Rachel also came to the committee 
with experience in this area, having worked at 
the Federation of American Scientists, the 
American Society for Engineering Education, 
and the American National Standards Institute. 

With intellectual curiosity and an appreciation 
for scientific knowledge, Rachel spent 
countless hours absorbing technical details 
and navigating the political and bureaucratic 
contexts of her issues. Rachel recognizes how 
science and technology can help communities 
meet their needs on the ground. 

Rachel performed valuable legislative and 
oversight duties for the committee. These legislative 
efforts included H.R. 5161, the Green 
Transportation Infrastructure Research and 
Technology Transfer Act and H.R. 3877, the 
Mine Communications Technology Innovation 
Act. Her oversight contributions included border 
security technologies and research and 
development for energy savings in transportation 
systems. 

Rachel has spent over 3 years working on 
the Hill and over 9 years in Washington. She 
is heading to Portland, and our loss is Oregon’s 
gain. She has been a wonderful asset 
to this committee and will be missed by both 
Members and staff. I want to thank her for her 
service to the committee and the science community 
at large, and I wish her—and her growing 
family—all the best.

FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION 
AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT 

SPEECH OF 

HON. VIRGINIA FOXX 

OF NORTH CAROLINA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, July 30, 2008 

Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose 
this 190-page bill, hastily offered under 
suspension of the rules, which establishes a 
new Federal authority for the regulation of the 
tobacco industry. This legislation adds another 
layer of bureaucracy to the already overburdened 
Food and Drug Administration, and another 
layer of regulation to American consumers’ 
lives. 

This bill includes more than $5 billion in new 
tax increases on tobacco companies and 
gives sweeping control of the tobacco market 
to the FDA. Chairman DINGELL, discussing the 
recent salmonella outbreak, was recently 
quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying 
that ‘‘there’s a total inability of the FDA to 


E1700 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

carry out its mission.’’ This isn’t the first Democrat 
to raise questions about the effectiveness 
of the FDA. Thus, it is highly hypocritical 
of them to extend the agency’s regulatory authority 
to a multi-billion dollar industry of which 
the FDA has no expertise. 

Furthermore, as FDA Commissioner Andrew 
von Eschenbach testified before the House 
Energy and Commerce Committee in October 
2007, the FDA is an agency intended to promote 
and protect the public health. In the 
Commissioner’s opinion, requiring the FDA to 
‘‘approve’’ tobacco products as a result of this 
bill would dramatically change the agency’s 
focus. Mr. von Eschenbach stated, ‘‘Associating 
any agency whose mission is to promote 
public health with the approval of inherently 
dangerous products would undermine its mission 
and likely have perverse incentive effects.’’ 


While establishing FDA authority to regulate 
tobacco products, this bill would also retain 
the FTC’s Federal authority to regulate tobacco 
advertising and circulation. It would provide 
only limited pre-emption of State laws, allowing 
more rigid State restrictions on tobacco 
advertising. These multiple layers of regulation 
will impose undue bureaucratic and logistical 
hardships on tobacco manufacturers. It is important 
to remember that the sale of tobacco, 
according to current law and expressly reinforced 
in this bill, is legal in the United States 
and can be credited with hundreds of thousands 
of jobs across the country. 

As Department of Health and Human Services 
Secretary Leavitt noted, this legislation 
could also be viewed by foreign governments 
as a hostile trade action. Many of the clove 
and other flavored cigarettes that are banned 
under this bill are manufactured in foreign 
countries. However, this bill expressly permits 
production of menthol cigarettes. This could 
lead Indonesia or other foreign governments 
to file complaints at the World Trade Organization 
claiming discrimination against their 
products. Ultimately, retaliatory measures 
could be taken against American-made products, 
which could lead to unnecessary trade 
disputes with a negative effect on economic 
growth. 

Finally, this legislation would have little impact 
on overall tobacco use. If this bill is enacted, 
the Congressional Budget Office has 
estimated that smoking by adults would decline 
only by 2 percent after 10 years. This 
marginal reduction does not warrant this legislation’s 
significant intrusion on free speech 
rights and expansion of government-run regulatory 
bureaucracy. Therefore, I strongly oppose 
this bill and urge my colleagues to vote 
against it.

THE DELAWARE TRIBE OF INDI


ANS JUDGMENT FUNDS DIS


TRIBUTION SETTLEMENT ACT 

HON. JOHN SULLIVAN 

OF OKLAHOMA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce H.R. 6786, the Delaware 
Tribe of Indians Judgment Funds Distribution 
Settlement Act. 

The Delaware Tribe was the first tribe to 
sign a treaty with the fledgling United States in 

1778, playing an important role in winning the 
Revolutionary War, and was called the 
‘‘Grandfather Tribe’’ by other tribes in and 
around the Delaware River valley. The Tribe 
was forced inexorably westward by the Colonies 
and then the United States from its aboriginal 
area further west and eventually into 
Cherokee territory in Oklahoma. 

The Tribe was recognized by the United 
States throughout the 20th century until it was 
terminated by the Department of the Interior in 
1979. The Department rescinded that decision 
in 1996, and the Tribe was recognized from 
1996 until 2004 when a Tenth Circuit Court 
decision ended the Tribe’s Federal recognition. 
The United States Solicitor General stated 
to the United States Supreme Court that 
the Tenth Circuit decision to end status of the 
tribe resulted in the need for Congress to address 
this issue. 

This legislation restores the rightful Federal 
recognition of the Delaware Tribe of Indians 
but also incorporates mechanisms for the 
Delaware Tribe of Indians and the Cherokee 
Nation to resolve issues between them in 
Eastern Oklahoma amicably. I am pleased to 
see not only Delaware restoration but also accord 
and cooperation between the two tribes.

HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to offer my heartfelt support and congratulations 
to the Bordentown Little League 
All-Stars who on Wednesday, won the New 
Jersey State Championship tournament and 
the right to now advance to the regional championship. 
Powered by some big bats—that 
turned in 17 hits and 4 home runs—the 
Bordentown Little League’s 11/12 year old 
team easily defeated Pequannock 14 to 3 to 
win the State Championship. By winning the 
New Jersey title, the team now moves onto 
Bristol, Connecticut, to participate in the Mid-
Atlantic Regional Tournament where they will 
take on Haverstraw, the New York State 
Champions. The A. Bartlett Giamatti Little 
League Leadership Training Center in Bristol, 
Connecticut, is hosting the Mid-Atlantic and 
New England tournaments. 

I especially want to recognize Manager Pat 
Welsh and Coach Dave Revay for their outstanding 
efforts developing this championship 
team. And of course, congratulations go out to 
the guys on the field who hustled throughout 
the season to win the New Jersey State 
Championship—Tommy ‘‘T-Walt’’ Walters, 
Zachary ‘‘Zack’’ Gakeler, Ryan ‘‘Shinny’’ 
Shinn, Patrick ‘‘Otrick’’ Welsh, Cole 
‘‘ColeTrain’’ Clauser, Tyler ‘‘Ty’’ Revay, Clarke 
‘‘Clarkey’’ Laba, Nick ‘‘Hammer’’ Callahan, Edward 
‘‘Eddie’’ Holmes, and the teams three 
Austin’s—Austin ‘‘Goke’’ Goeke, Austin ‘‘Char-
zar’’ Chaszar, and Austin ‘‘Big Pappi’’ Papp. 

Gratitude also has to be given to the 
Bordentown community for their spirit and the 
continuing support they offered which helped 
make fielding this outstanding team possible. 
Community leaders—Mayor George A. 
Chidley, Deputy Mayor Bruce Hill, Committeeman 
William J. Morelli, Committeeman Robert 

Delaney, and Committeeman Mark Roselli 
from Bordentown Township; and Mayor John 
William Collom III, Deputy Mayor James 
Lynch, and Commissioner John Wehrman 
from the city of Bordentown have to be recognized 
and thanked for making this State 
Championship possible. 

As the Bordentown Little League All-Stars 
now move onto the Regional Championship, 
we join with family and friends in the entire 
Bordentown and Burlington County communities 
to wish them good luck.

TRIBUTE TO STAN SMOYER 

HON. RUSH D. HOLT 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Stanley C. Smoyer for his years of 
extraordinary leadership in the family planning 
movement in the United States, his devoted 
service to Planned Parenthood Association of 
the Mercer Area in New Jersey, and for his 
extraordinary generosity to his community. 

For over 50 years, Stan Smoyer has been 
a champion of women’s reproductive rights. 
As former assistant general counsel for Johnson 
& Johnson, he was involved in reproductive 
rights litigation in the 1960s. Of particular 
note was his involvement in Griswold v Connecticut, 
the 1965 landmark case in which the 
Supreme Court of the United States ruled that 
the Constitution protected a right to privacy 
and that access to contraception could not be 
prohibited. In 1995, he and his late wife, Barbara, 
were awarded Planned Parenthood’s 
highest honor, the Sanger Circle Award, in 
recognition of their outstanding service and 
loyalty to Planned Parenthood and to the 
cause of reproductive rights. 

As a board member of Planned Parenthood 
I am particularly grateful to him for his years 
of participation. As Vice Chairman for Principal 
Gifts of Planned Parenthood’s 1991 capital 
campaign, Stan Smoyer demonstrated his 
commitment to the issues by helping the 
agency raise millions of dollars. In 2006, Stan 
Smoyer was recruited once again to help 
Planned Parenthood, this time as Honorary 
Co-Chair of Stand with Us: The Campaign for 
Responsible Choices. Thanks to his generosity, 
the capital campaign is well on its way 
to reaching its goal. 

Stan Smoyer has also been a benefactor of 
both Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts 
and Dartmouth University in New Hampshire. 
His most recent gift to Phillips Academy 
renovated and improved the soccer field, 
where his sons used to play. The field, now 
known as Smoyer Family Field, is named in 
honor of Mr. Smoyer’s sons, David, class of 
’59 and William, class of ’63, who was killed 
in Vietnam in 1968. 

A 1934 graduate of Dartmouth, Stan 
Smoyer has made a commitment to his alma 
mater for a new intercollegiate soccer facility. 
He has also been a donor to the school’s History 
Department programs and to other scholarship 
and athletic endeavors. 

Stanley C. Smoyer’s devotion to the causes 
and initiatives that he believes in makes him 
an outstanding friend, neighbor and community 
benefactor. He is worthy of our admiration 
and gratitude and continues to serve as a 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1701 

model for other philanthropists and volunteers 
who think of others and care about where our 
society is headed. 

It is with pride and pleasure I recognize 
Stanley C. Smoyer here today and ask my 
colleagues to join me in thanking him for his 
dedicated and generous service to Planned 
Parenthood, his community of Princeton, the 
schools he has chosen to support, and for 
teaching us all the lesson of giving and caring.

H. RES. 1355, SUPPORT DISABILITY 
PRIDE DAY 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 

OF MINNESOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. 
Res. 1355, a resolution to support the goals 
and ideals of Disability Pride Day. 

Over 18 years ago Congress passed the 
Americans with Disabilities Act into law to end 
discrimination against and provide equal opportunities 
for people living with disabilities. It 
was a historic and proud day for the United 
States. The significant contributions to American 
life, our economy and every aspect of our 
society by people with disabilities deserve to 
be recognized and honored. While great 
strides have been made to ensure all rights for 
people living with disabilities are respected, 
we must always celebrate the victories and act 
with vigilance and determination to protect, defend 
and advance those rights. 

This resolution expresses support for Disability 
Pride Day, and acknowledges the efforts 
of Chicago’s 5th Annual Disability Pride 
Parade organizers for raising awareness for 
the needs of those with disabilities. It also 
urges public officials and the general public to 
support and encourage understanding of persons 
with disabilities. 

We need to help support and encourage understanding 
of persons with disabilities in 
schools, the workforce, and in our communities. 
It is unacceptable that only one-third of 
Americans with disabilities are employed and 
people with disabilities are three times more 
likely to live in poverty. I believe all Americans 
should have the opportunity to achieve economic 
independence, which is why I support 
efforts to improve employment programs for 
individuals with disabilities. I also believe 
every child deserves a quality and affordable 
education, and we must ensure that our 
schools are adequately funded to promise a 
fair education for all children with disabilities. 
I support full funding the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act, IDEA, which is why I 
introduced the Achieving Our IDEA Act, H.R. 
1896. This bill will help ensure that the Federal 
Government contributes 40 percent to the 
cost of educating children with special needs. 

This year Congress also took action to ensure 
the rights of those with disabilities. The 
ADA Amendments Act, of which I was a cosponsor, 
passed the House with overwhelming 
support on June 25, 2008. This bill protects individuals 
from employment discrimination in 
the workplace for those who can and want to 
work, and restores the original intent of Congress. 
All Americans should be able to live 
and work in their communities without fear of 
being discriminated against. 

All people have the right to be active, contributing 
members of our society and fully engaged 
citizens. I will continue to support efforts 
to improve the quality of life for individuals 
with disabilities. 

I urge my colleagues to support this resolution 
and celebrate Disability Pride Day.

SUPPORTING NATIONAL NIGHT 
OUT 

SPEECH OF 

HON. BOBBY L. RUSH 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, July 29, 2008 

Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
voice my full and enthusiastic support for H. 
Res. 1324. With violence on the rise in many 
communities, including my home district of 
Chicago, I have committed myself to raising 
the issue of gun violence within the U.S. Congress. 
We must effectively address this issue 
and begin to repair the devastation that it has 
caused for countless families, communities, 
and neighborhoods. 

Since February, I have been speaking of the 
‘‘Daily 45s’’, the number of casualties the Department 
of Justice reports that our Nation suffers 
every day due to gun violence. Though 
the number of gun shot fatalities that Americans 
endure here in our own communities 
dwarfs the number of daily casualties our 
troops suffer in two war zones combined, in 
Iraq and Afghanistan, it saddens and frustrates 
me that this issue is not being discussed 
more here in Congress. 

As a country, we are not doing enough to 
address this deadly issue. That is why I proudly 
support H. Res. 1324, which asks the President 
to focus appropriate attention on neighborhood 
crime prevention and community policing, 
and to coordinate Federal efforts to participate 
in National Night Out on the first Tuesday 
in August. 

Additionally, like my Communities in Action 
Neighborhood Defense and Opportunity (CAN 
DO) bill, which I will soon be introducing, H. 
Res. 1324 provides Federal support to assist 
local efforts in addressing the issue of violence. 
This bill assists community watch 
groups by supporting local officials in an effort 
to promote community safety and help secure 
our homeland. 

It is past time for Americans of all races, 
classes, and geographic locations to come together 
and put an end to the senseless violence 
that is gripping our Nation. H. Res. 1324 
goes a long way in bringing this deadly subject 
into the light and forcing all of us to deal 
with this devastating problem. I urge all of my 
colleagues to support this measure as well.

SUNSET MEMORIAL 

HON. TRENT FRANKS 

OF ARIZONA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Madam Speaker, I 
stand once again before this House with yet 
another Sunset Memorial. 

It is August 1, 2008 in the land of the free 
and the home of the brave, and before the 

sun set today in America, almost 4,000 more 
defenseless unborn children were killed by 
abortion on demand. That’s just today, Mr. 
Speaker. That’s more than the number of innocent 
lives lost on September 11 in this 
country, only it happens every day. 

It has now been exactly 12,975 days since 
the tragedy called Roe v. Wade was first 
handed down. Since then, the very foundation 
of this Nation has been stained by the blood 
of almost 50 million of its own children. Some 
of them, Mr. Speaker, cried and screamed as 
they died, but because it was amniotic fluid 
passing over the vocal cords instead of air, we 
couldn’t hear them. 

All of them had at least four things in common. 
First, they were each just little babies 
who had done nothing wrong to anyone, and 
each one of them died a nameless and lonely 
death. And each one of their mothers, whether 
she realizes it or not, will never be quite the 
same. And all the gifts that these children 
might have brought to humanity are now lost 
forever. Yet even in the glare of such tragedy, 
this generation still clings to a blind, invincible 
ignorance while history repeats itself and our 
own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the 
most helpless of all victims, those yet unborn. 

Madam Speaker, perhaps it’s time for those 
of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves of 
why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson 
said, ‘‘The care of human life and its happiness 
and not its destruction is the chief and 
only object of good government.’’ The phrase 
in the 14th Amendment capsulizes our entire 
Constitution. It says, ‘‘No State shall deprive 
any person of life, liberty or property without 
due process of law.’’ Mr. Speaker, protecting 
the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional 
rights is why we are all here. 

The bedrock foundation of this Republic is 
the clarion declaration of the self-evident truth 
that all human beings are created equal and 
endowed by their Creator with the unalienable 
rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
Every conflict and battle our Nation has 
ever faced can be traced to our commitment 
to this core, self-evident truth. 

It has made us the beacon of hope for the 
entire world. Madam Speaker, it is who we 
are. 

And yet today another day has passed, and 
we in this body have failed again to honor that 
foundational commitment. We have failed our 
sworn oath and our God-given responsibility 
as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent 
American babies who died today without 
the protection we should have given them. 

So, Madam Speaker, let me conclude this 
Sunset Memorial in the hope that perhaps 
someone new who heard it tonight will finally 
embrace the truth that abortion really does kill 
little babies; that it hurts mothers in ways that 
we can never express; and that 12,975 days 
spent killing nearly 50 million unborn children 
in America is enough; and that it is time that 
we stood up together again, and remembered 
that we are the same America that rejected 
human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest 
the Nazi Holocaust; and we are still courageous 
and compassionate enough to find a 
better way for mothers and their unborn babies 
than abortion on demand. 

Madam Speaker, as we consider the plight 
of unborn America tonight, may we each remind 
ourselves that our own days in this sunshine 
of life are also numbered and that all too 
soon each one of us will walk from these 
Chambers for the very last time. 


E1702 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks August 1, 2008 

And if it should be that this Congress is allowed 
to convene on yet another day to come, 
may that be the day when we finally hear the 
cries of innocent unborn children. May that be 
the day when we find the humanity, the courage, 
and the will to embrace together our 
human and our constitutional duty to protect 
these, the least of our tiny, little American 
brothers and sisters from this murderous 
scourge upon our Nation called abortion on 
demand. 

It is August 1, 2008, 12,975 days since Roe 
versus Wade first stained the foundation of 
this Nation with the blood of its own children; 
this in the land of the free and the home of the 
brave.

HONORING BOB O’CONNELL 

HON. MARCY KAPTUR 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, today, I 
would like to recognize the legacy contributions 
of a great father, grandfather, athlete, 
teacher, and coach Mr. Bob O’Connell of Toledo, 
Ohio. Recently, Bob was acknowledged 
by a wonderful story published in the Toledo 
Blade tracing his many accomplishments. Our 
entire community applauds him for his life’s 
achievements, and thanks him. 

Bob has taught and mentored thousands 
and thousands of young athletes across our 
community in his chosen sport of tennis. For 
21 years, he coached students at Rogers and 
Ottawa Hills High Schools during the regular 
school year and summer. Truly, he has been 
a teacher’s teacher and a coaches’ coach and 
has been recognized in the Ohio High School 
Tennis Coaches Hall of Fame. Bob also 
taught history and worked to develop his students 
as well-rounded persons who are both 
academically and physically fit. I can personally 
attest to his skill and patience having been 
one of his many students so many years ago. 
Bob taught not just the skills of tennis and endurance, 
but also what it meant to be a good 
sport. He held his racket with distinction, kept 
focus, and airily breezed across the court with 
an ease that demonstrated this indeed was his 
sport. 

Bob raised another generation of 
O’Connell’s who follow in his footsteps, his 
son Kevin, Sr., was the No. 1 singles player 
for 3 years at St. Francis and earned a scholarship 
to college as a result. Now his children, 
Kevin Jr. achieved rank as an All-City League 
first team player all 4 years as a high school 
and Kelly O’Connell was the No. 1 singles 
player at St. Ursula for 3 years. 

It is hard to place an adequate value on a 
man who has played such a significant father-
figure role not just to his family but to our 
community, using his teaching and coaching 
abilities to rear the next generation. I feel personally 
honored to have been coached by Bob 
O’Connell and recognize his extraordinary accomplishments 
as an American who gave so 
much of himself, so quietly and effectively, to 
the next generation. He is the kind of man that 
deserves admiration for he exemplifies what it 
means to be a man for others. May he and his 
family enjoy many years together and may he 
and they know how truly our community expresses 
its gratitude to him. Onward. 

RECOGNIZING EVONIK DEGUSSA 
INDUSTRIES IN MOBILE, ALABAMA 
ON 35 YEARS OF SERVICE 
IN ALABAMA 

HON. JO BONNER 

OF ALABAMA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. BONNER. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor Evonik Degussa Industries located in 
Mobile, Alabama, on 35 years of business and 
service to our community. 

Founded as Degussa, the 160 acre site in 
Mobile was established 35 years ago. Last 
year, the German chemical company was purchased 
by Evonik Industries AG and is now 
operating as Evonik Degussa Industries. With 
44,000 employees in over 100 countries 
around the world, Evonik Industries is the 
global market leader in specialty chemicals 
and presently maintains several locations in 
the United States, Canada and Mexico. 

The Mobile plant manufactures a range of 
products from hydrogen peroxide to a binding 
agent used in more than 250 products ranging 
from ketchup to paint. The $1.2 billion complex 
is the company’s largest facility outside of 
Europe with approximately 700 employees. 
The Mobile plant has announced several new 
projects just in the last year. In October, 
Evonik Degussa announced it is adding a new 
biodiesel project, which will add production of 
a specialty chemical used to make alternative 
fuels. Once fully operational, the new plant will 
have the annual capacity to produce 60,000 
metric tons of alkoxides, a catalyst for biodiesel 
production. 

Evonik Degussa is also adding a $10 million 
expansion which will allow for the production 
of ROHACELL, which is high-tech foam used 
in a wide-range of products including airplane 
wings and skis. Earlier this year, Evonik 
Degussa announced it is considering a $65 
million expansion to make a chemical for 
chicken feed. 

Evonik Degussa not only creates essentials 
for everyday use, but the employees and the 
management team strive to make a positive 
impact on the citizens of Mobile County 
through heavy community involvement. The 
company supports numerous local causes 
through its ‘‘Essential to the Community’’ donation 
program and gives more than $100,000 
each year to the arts, schools, and charitable 
organizations. In 2006, the Mobile plant donated 
$115,000 to community activities. These 
contributions included $55,000 to Mobile civic 
organizations, $40,000 to educational activities, 
$10,500 to the arts, and $1,700 to environmental 
groups. 

It is evident Evonik Degussa is passionate 
about serving the Mobile community, and this 
dedication deserves recognition. Evonik 
Degussa exemplifies the spirit of volunteerism 
and serves as an outstanding corporate citizen 
of Alabama. Furthermore, their dedication to 
improving the lives of their fellow citizens sets 
them apart from many other companies. 
Evonik Degussa remains a strong supporter of 
our community and is a wonderful corporate 
role model. 

Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating both the employees and 
management team at Evonik Degussa Industries 
for 35 years of operations in the Mobile 
area. I know the employees, their friends, fam


ilies, and members of the community join with 
me in praising Evonik Degussa Industries for 
their many accomplishments. I extend my 
thanks for their continued service to the Mobile, 
Alabama business community, the First 
Congressional District, and the state of Alabama.

60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
FOUNDING OF THE STATE OF 
ISRAEL 

HON. RICK LARSEN 

OF WASHINGTON 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate the nation of 
Israel and her people on the recent 60th Anniversary 
of the founding of the state of Israel. 
The United States stood with Israel in 1948 as 
it took the first steps forward as a new nation 
and we proudly stand with her today. 

The United States and Israel are bound together 
by a shared history and shared values. 
We share thriving, plurastic democracies that 
allow for—and encourage—open political discourse 
and opposition. Both counties are governed 
by the rule of law and share fundamental 
freedoms such as the freedom of 
speech and religion. And our economies share 
an entrepreneurial spirit which gives those 
from all walks of life the opportunity to succeed. 


The United States has no better ally and 
friend in the Middle East than Israel. Both peoples 
strive to live in peace and protect our 
communities from those who would do us 
harm. The United States stands with Israel 
against any threats to the security and existence 
of your country, and we stand with you 
as you strive to secure a peaceful and lasting 
relationship with your neighbors. 

Madam Speaker, as we join with Israel to 
celebrate 60 years as an independent and 
free state, now is the time for the United 
States to reaffirm our support for our ally and 
friend. Thank you.

TRIBUTE TO AUGUSTINE 
OLIVENCIA 

HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. HIGGINS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the many personal and professional 
accomplishments of Augustine Olivencia. Mr. 
Olivencia, known by one and all as ‘‘Chito,’’ is 
a true leader for all western New Yorkers. 

Professionally, Chito has served for many 
years as Superintendent of Ellicott Creek Park 
in the town of Tonawanda, and his service in 
that role has been exemplary. But Chito has 
truly made his mark as a dedicated activist 
within his beloved Hispanic community. In fact, 
for public officials living throughout western 
New York, many conversations with Chito both 
begin and end with a playful but serious reminder 
that the Hispanic community remains a 
growing constituency in western New York, 
and that collectively the community remains a 
force with which to be reckoned. 


August 1, 2008 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1703 

Chito serves as Chairman of the Board at 
the Augustine ‘‘Pucho’’ Olivencia Community 
Center in Buffalo. Named for Chito’s late father, 
the Olivencia Center works to provide the 
community with educational and recreational 
services and preserve the culture of this proud 
community. Every year, Chito chairs the Community 
Center’s Annual Greased Pole Festival, 
a weekend of events. In addition, each January 
Chito hosts the annual Three Kings Day 
celebration to educate and entertain children 
from the throughout the community and beyond. 


In addition, Chito serves as President of 
Nosotros, the largest Hispanic political organization 
in western New York, which owns the 
Fiesta Latina show that airs in the evenings on 
WHLD–AM. Chito has also volunteered his 
time to the renowned Sts. Columba-Brigid 
Roman Catholic Church by hosting masses for 
a year after a fire destroyed the Church in 
2006. 

Chito’s desire to learn about other cultures 
is vast. In June 2004, Chito was the local 
Project Interchange Designee by the American 
Jewish Committee Buffalo-Niagara Chapter. In 
that capacity, Chito traveled to Israel as part 
of the cultural exchange program. During the 
trip, he met with civic and political leaders in 
Israel, briefing members of the local AJC 
chapter upon his return. 

Lastly, I cannot end this speech without a 
few words about Chito’s long career in Democratic 
politics. Chito has been a Democratic 
Committeeman in Erie County for longer than 
many current committee members have been 
alive, and his allegiance to the Democratic 
Party is legendary. From elections to the Buffalo 
School Board to Congress and the White 
House, Chito’s commitment to the political 
process and to enhancing suffrage throughout 
the Hispanic community has been remarkable. 

Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring Chito Olivencia for all that he has 
done for the western New York community, 
and join me in celebrating his retirement from 
active service in Erie County government.

remains an independent telephone service 
provider faithfully serving the people of south 
central Michigan. 

In 1908, the Sand Creek Telephone Company 
began doing business with one switchboard 
and operator in the back of the Tuttle 
family’s grocery store. Started by local farmers 
and business owners, the telephone company 
was created to serve the rural areas south of 
the city of Adrian. The original stockholders 
needed telephone service to check the weather, 
market prices, train schedules, and to 
order or sell goods. Purchased in 1912, its 
first telephones were old-fashioned, rectangular, 
wall-mounted wooden box telephones 
with a side crank and a Bakelite receiver. 
These telephones were used up until 1957 
when the company upgraded to an automatic 
dial system. 

In 1912, the Sand Creek Telephone Company 
moved from the Tuttle grocery store to a 
house on a property called Lot Six, which provided 
a central location within the town. From 
here, the company continued to experience 
enormous growth. By 1928, 270 households 
were serviced by Sand Creek Telephone 
Company and its lines connected to areas as 
far away as Lyons, Ohio. The massive web of 
wires that draped above the town were evidence 
of the rapid expansion of the company 
during this time. As Sand Creek Telephone 
Company changed hands over the years, the 
Board of Directors continued to hire families to 
run the company. Many times the husband did 
the maintenance and business work while the 
wife ran the switchboard. Children of the operating 
family also helped out when needed. 

With technological advances came changes 
for the Sand Creek Telephone Company. In 
1957, the company upgraded its system to 
Automatic Dial Operation. Customers received 
a letter detailing how calling procedures would 
change. New equipment from Stromberg-Carlson 
was purchased to support the new direct 
dial technology. The old wooden telephones 
were collected and replaced with updated 
ones. Switchboard operators were no longer 
needed; however, business was still conducted 
at the Lot Six location until 1995. 

The last twenty years brought more change 
for Sand Creek Telephone Company than 
throughout the previous eighty years. The 
company has prevailed in the struggle to keep 
up with ever-advancing technology. By 1990, it 
was able to provide cellular phone service to 
customers and in 1995 the company installed 
its first fiber-optic cable and was officially 
ready for the Internet age. By this time, the 
company had over nine hundred subscribers. 
In 1996, the company became Sand Creek 
Communications Company and expanded to 
its current location on the southeast corner of 
West Gorman Road and Sand Creek Highway. 


Sand Creek Telephone Company, a valued 
communications provider, has long been a 
source of pride in the Adrian community. In 
the old days, customers often stopped in to 

pay their bills in person and catch up on town 
news or gossip. One couple even decided to 
get married while they were sitting on the 
wooden plank in the front office. Although the 
company has changed with technological advances, 
it continues to be a part of the community 
that gave it a start, never forgetting its 
original purpose—connecting neighbor with 
neighbor. 

Madam Speaker, today I ask my colleagues 
to join me in recognizing Sand Creek Telephone 
Company for its one hundred years of 
service to the rural areas of south central 
Michigan. From one hundred subscribers in 
the beginning to over eleven hundred today, 
Sand Creek Telephone Company remains a 
treasured small-town success. May others 
know of my high regard for its esteemed service, 
as well as my best wishes for the future.

HONORING A GENUINE HEROINE, 

IRENA SENDLER, WHO RISKED 

HER LIFE FOR THOUSANDS 

HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, August 1, 2008 

Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
because every so often, an everyday person 
of not-so-everyday valor risks personal injury 
and livelihood—to little fanfare—for the good 
of humanity. Today, we provide that deserved 
fanfare to one of those unsung heroes, Irena 
Sendler, a woman of such rock-steady courage 
that she fearlessly saved lives in the face 
of Nazi opposition. The protection of even one 
life is immeasurably valuable, but Ms. Sendler 
rescued over 2,500 of them, mostly Jewish 
children languishing in Poland’s Warsaw ghetto 
during the Holocaust. Ms. Sendler died this 
past May at 98, but that giving spirit remains 
a shining exemplar of what humanity can accomplish, 
of what we all aspire to emulate. 

Such selflessness is not easy. She was arrested, 
tortured, and sentenced to death by 
the Gestapo for her heroic acts, ferrying children 
from run-down ghettos that had left them 
vulnerable to disease, execution, and deportation 
to concentration camps. She escaped 
from prison and continued to do her good— 
and remarkably dangerous—works. These are 
the glowing stories that, buried in the overwhelmingly 
horrific and dark period in history 
that was the Holocaust, remind us that although 
there can be unspeakable evil, we are 
always capable of combating it with good. 

Her death is a loss of a compassionate and 
awe-inspiring human being for this world, but 
her story is immortal. May it continue to warm 
our hearts and edify our lives.

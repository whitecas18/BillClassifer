United States 
of America PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATES OF THE 110th 
CONGRESS, FIRST SESSION 

Vol. 153 WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, MAY 1, 2007 No. 70 

House of Representatives 

The House met at 10:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tempore 
(Mr. WELCH of Vermont).

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 

The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before 
the House the following communication 
from the Speaker: 

WASHINGTON, DC, 

May 1, 2007. 

I hereby appoint the Honorable PETER 
WELCH to act as Speaker pro tempore on this 
day. 

NANCY PELOSI, 

Speaker of the House of Representatives.

MORNING HOUR DEBATES 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to the order of the House of January 
4, 2007, the Chair will now recognize 
Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning hour debates. The Chair will 
alternate recognition between the parties, 
with each party limited to not to 
exceed 30 minutes, and each Member, 
except the majority leader, the minority 
leader, or the minority whip, limited 
to not to exceed 5 minutes. 

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. COBLE) for 5 
minutes. 

f 

PAUL WOLFOWITZ 

Mr. COBLE. I thank the Speaker. 

Mr. Speaker, in this town when a 
Democrat screws up, Democrats are reluctant 
to criticize. By the same token, 
when a Republican screws up, Republicans 
are reluctant to criticize. Today, 
Mr. Speaker, I intend to depart from 
this accepted practice and direct attention—
if not criticism—to the World 
Bank matter. 

Mr. Paul Wolfowitz was one of the architects 
of the war in Iraq. He was generally 
awarded low marks for his Iraqi 

performance. Then he was subsequently 
elevated to the presidency of 
the World Bank. Allegations of mismanagement 
of the World Bank under 
Mr. Wolfowitz’s leadership have recently 
been prominently reported. 

The Congress may or may not become 
involved, and the two House committees 
on which I sit—Transportation 
and Judiciary—likely will not become 
involved, nor am I accusing Mr. 
Wolfowitz of wrongdoing. That is for 
the appropriate World Bank panel to 
resolve. 

Mr. Speaker, if it is determined in 
fact that mismanagement did occur on 
President Wolfowitz’s watch, I suppose 
two options would follow: his resignation 
or his retention. If the latter, the 
appropriate World Bank panel may 
consider attaching a shorter, tighter 
leash to Mr. Wolfowitz because the 
present leash—if there is a leash at 
all—appears to be inadequate. But 
based upon my limited familiarity with 
facts surrounding the World Bank matter, 
I opt for the retention of Mr. 
Wolfowitz in lieu of his resignation. 

His questionable and misguided leadership 
regarding the Iraqi War, plus the 
allegations of mismanagement at the 
World Bank under his watch notwithstanding, 
Paul Wolfowitz has made significant 
contributions during his years 
of public service and probably deserves 
another chance with the aforementioned 
leash permanently attached. 

Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, if Members 
of the Congress openly criticize members 
of our own party—especially members 
of our own party—when criticism 
is warranted, I believe our constituents 
will applaud such objectivity. And I 
furthermore believe, Mr. Speaker, that 
fewer accusations of screw-ups, mischief, 
mismanagement and scandal will 
be voiced and hopefully fewer acts of 
screw-ups, mischief, mismanagement 
and scandals will be practiced. 

Mr. Speaker, on that optimistic note, 
I conclude and yield back the balance 
of my time. 

IRAQ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to the order of the House of January 
4, 2007, the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. DEFAZIO) is recognized during 
morning hour debates for 5 minutes. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Well, President Bush 
and Vice President CHENEY have made 
much on the talk shows of the last 2 
weeks saying the Congress—the Democrats—
are trying change direction in 
Iraq and should listen to the military 
professionals. Now, if only this administration 
had taken its own advice. If 
they had listened to the military professionals 
and the intelligence professionals, 
we would never have gone to 
war in Iraq. The trail of this administration 
to the sad fourth anniversary 
of Mission Accomplished is littered 
with professional, military and intelligence 
advice that was either ignored, 
discarded or deliberately distorted. 
There were no links to 9/11 and al 
Qaeda. That was recently declassified 
in a report on April 6 of this year. 
There were no weapons of mass destruction, 
despite statements from the 
likes of Vice President CHENEY. ‘‘We 
believe Saddam has in fact reconstituted 
nuclear weapons.’’ 3/16/2003. 
The war has drug on for 4 long years 
since the President—dressed as a fake 
fighter jock—landed on the deck of an 
aircraft carrier and declared Mission 
Accomplished. Since that day, more 
than two U.S. soldiers have died every 
day for 1,460 days. Three thousand 

three hundred forty-two have died, 
3,205 since George Bush proclaimed 
mission accomplished. 

Now, they have been so wrong all 
along with their inside advice, their 
made-up intelligence, their own neocon 
theories. They were wrong about, 
again, ‘‘We will, in fact, be greeted as 
liberators. I think it will go relatively 
quickly, weeks rather than months.’’ 
Vice President CHENEY. 3/16/2003. 

‘‘We’re dealing with a country that 
can finance its own reconstruction and

relatively soon.’’ 3/27/2003, Deputy Secretary 
Wolfowitz, who was promoted to 
the World Bank so he could get his 
girlfriend a job. He was kind of wrong, 
too. 

Now the scandals are unfolding about 
what little reconstruction has been 
done and how poorly it was done. But 
Halliburton has benefited tremendously—
over $25 billion of no-bid contracts 
which has probably boosted Vice 
President CHENEY’s portfolio quite a 
bit. So there have been some successes 
in this effort. 

Our troops have done everything that 
was asked, many of them now on their 
second and third tour of duty. They are 
mired in the midst of a 1,400-year-old 
sectarian conflict—a civil war. The 
Iraqi government has delivered on no 
promises to take meaningful steps to 
end that civil war. There is not a singular 
military solution to this conflict. 
There must be a political solution in 
Iraq. There must be diplomacy in the 
region. And yes to the President and 
the Vice President—we need a new direction. 


And this Congress is listening to the 
professionals. Unfortunately, mostly 
we have to hear from the retired generals 
and the others because those who 
are still in uniform are being gagged by 
this administration from giving their 
true opinions about the changes that 
are necessary to extract our troops 
from the midst of that conflict. 

This is a sad fourth anniversary. But 
it is the first anniversary of attempts 
by this Congress to stand up for its 
constitutional obligations and begin to 
try and change course, to end the stay-
the-course, open-ended commitment of 
George Bush and DICK CHENEY who 
have been wrong every step of the way. 

Someone else needs to push for 
change in Iraq, because it will never 
come from this White House.

GEORGE SCHAEFER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to the order of the House of January 
4, 2007, the gentleman from Kentucky 
(Mr. DAVIS) is recognized during 
morning hour debates for 2 minutes. 
Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Thank you, 
Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a 
distinguished businessman, philanthropist, 
decorated military officer, 
fellow West Point graduate and a pillar 
of our community in northern Kentucky 
and Cincinnati. 
Next month Mr. George Schaefer will 
retire from his position at Fifth Third 
Bank. Beginning as a management 
trainee in 1971 after completing his 
service in the Army, George rose 
through the ranks at Fifth Third and 
helped the company to grow into one of 
the largest financial institutions and 
bank holding companies in the United 
States. 
As George’s career grew, so too did 
his commitment to making the entire 
Cincinnati metropolitan region a better 
place to live, work and go to school. 

He has raised millions of dollars for the 
United Way and the Cincinnati Fine 
Arts Fund. For 12 years, he sat on the 
board of trustees of the University of 
Cincinnati where he helped the University 
grow into one of the Nation’s premier 
educational institutions. 

George, while your talents and leadership 
will surely be missed at Fifth 
Third, I know that your inspired work 
in the community will continue. I wish 
to thank you and your wife Betty Ann 
for all of your service and wish you the 
best as you embark on this new chapter 
in your life. 

Thank you for your service to our 
Nation in uniform, for answering the 
Nation’s call. Thank you for your contributions 
to our community. Thank 
you for pouring yourself into so many 
aspects to improve the quality of lives 
for our communities in northern Kentucky 
and the greater Cincinnati area 
and every city where Fifth Third is involved. 


We are grateful for that commitment, 
for the example of service and 
your upholding the values that we both 
share of duty, honor and country.

HONORING NICK POLIZZOTTO 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to the order of the House of January 
4, 2007, the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. DONNELLY) is recognized during 
morning hour debates for 2 minutes. 

Mr. DONNELLY. Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. 

I rise today in tribute to Corporal 
Nick Polizzotto, 9-year veteran of the 
South Bend Police Department who 
gave his life in the line of duty. For the 
people of South Bend, Indiana, Corporal 
Polizzotto is our hero. 

On April 24th, 2007, a report of gunshots 
brought Corporal Polizzotto and 
his partner, Patrolman Michael Norby, 
to a local motel. There at 1:37 a.m. an 
armed suspect shot both policemen, 
killing Corporal Polizzotto and wounding 
Patrolman Norby. Patrolman 
Norby credits Corporal Polizzotto with 
saving his life. 

Our community has lost a beloved 
family member, a generous friend, a 
devoted father, and a dedicated protector. 
Often described as having a 
heart of gold, he proudly wore his uniform 
and bravely patrolled the streets 
of our city until making the ultimate 
sacrifice. 

Born and raised in South Bend, Nick 
always wanted to be a police officer. 
During his many years as a South Bend 
officer, he received 18 commendations 
and was officer of the month in 2006. 

Corporal Polizzotto leaves behind his 
parents, his wonderful son Joe and 
Joe’s mom Michelle, a brother Tony, a 
sister Amy and countless relatives and 
friends who loved him. South Bend has 
lost a brave guardian. 

Mr. Speaker, we grieve for our hero, 
Corporal Nick Polizzotto. May God 
welcome him home and give comfort to 
his family and friends.

Lord our God, great provider and bulwark 
of justice, listen to our prayers 
today as we pray for all those who by 
their daily labor build Your kingdom 
and establish relationships that will 
last. 

Created in Your image and commissioned 
to be stewards of creation, guide 
the judgments of our minds and the 
precision of our hands that the work of 
this day may give You glory and serve 
the needs of our sisters and brothers. 

Since we look upon the whole universe 
in relation to You, order all the 
endeavors of the human family to benefit 
the least in our midst and realize 
Your gracious plan at work in our 
humble service. 

To You be praise, glory, and honor 
now and forever. 

Amen.

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. COHEN. Today is the fourth anniversary 
of the President of the 
United States announcing ‘‘Mission Accomplished.’’ 
It is also the day of the 
publication of a book called ‘‘The Life 
and Times of Warren Zevon,’’ a biography 
of a dear friend of mine who was 
a late, great singer/song writer. I wanted 
to address both topics, and I think I 
can do it together. 
Four years ago, when the President 
announced ‘‘Mission Accomplished,’’ he 
was right if he was talking about Saddam 
Hussein’s government being toppled; 
but otherwise, he was wrong and 
he has been channeling Warren Zevon 
who said, ‘‘I’m caught between a rock 
and a hard place. Send lawyers, guns, 
and money. The Shiites have hit the 
fan.’’ 
Warren Zevon, requiescat in pace. 
Mr. President, please sign the bill the 
Congress has given you to end this war, 
to end the occupation, and to bring our 
troops home. 

f 

WE MUST PROVIDE FOR OUR 
TROOPS 

(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, just this morning we 
received reports that the al Qaeda leader 
in Iraq has been killed. Despite such 
signs that support for the terrorist 
group in Iraq is fading, Democrats in 
Congress continue to advocate retreat 
and defeat. Fortunately for American 
families and our troops in the battlefield, 
we have a Commander in Chief 
who understands that victory is essential. 
As the Washington Post has editorialized: 
‘‘America’s defeat will lead to 
catastrophic civilian deaths, the reestablishment 
of terrorist training 
camps, and possibly a regional war. We 
must face the terrorists overseas, or we 
will face them again in the streets of 
America.’’ 

Our Nation is at war. Our troops are 
bravely serving their country. We have 
a responsibility to provide for their 
well-being. I support President Bush’s 
pending veto and look forward to passing 
a clean supplemental bill that fully 
funds our soldiers’ mission of protecting 
American families. 

In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September 11. 

f 

A NEW DIRECTION 
(Mr. LARSON of Connecticut asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, 4 years ago, the President declared 
victory onboard the Abraham 
Lincoln. 

Indeed, our troops have performed 
valiantly and achieved military victory. 
There is no question about that 
or their performance. But 4 years later, 
we find ourselves still in a quagmire, a 
quagmire that even the head of the CIA 
said was now all trumped up with misinformation, 
misled the country, sacrificing 
brave men and women and their 
lives in Iraq. 

What we need is for the President to 
step up and recognize what the American 
people are calling for: a new direction. 
Refocus on Afghanistan, go after 
the terrorists where they are, go after 
Osama bin Laden, the people who actually 
took down the tower, and end this 
quagmire. And the only reason that we 
are there and continue to lose lives, because 
there is no mission other than 
arrogance and hubris that has led this 
President to stay this course in spite of 
the sacrifice by our brave troops and 
men, when 61 percent of the Iraqi people 
say it is okay to kill Americans, 
that sectarian violence is okay, and in 
the midst of the civil war is not where 
we belong. 

f 

IRAQ SUPPLEMENT 
(Mr. GINGREY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, indeed 
it is an anniversary. It’s about the 
80th-day anniversary since the President 
asked for funding for our troops. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong 
opposition to the theatrics the Democratic 
majority is trying to pass off as 
some kind of policy. 
Today, Speaker PELOSI will stage an 
elaborate and politically timed signing 
ceremony for the Iraq troop withdrawal 
bill Congress passed 5 days ago. 
As President Bush has already vowed 
to veto this irresponsible legislation, 
Speaker PELOSI’s theatrics are simply 
slowing down the process of getting 
much needed funding and money to our 
troops. 
Let me remind the American people 
that our warfighters have been waiting 
nearly 3 months for Congress to pass 
the President’s requested supplemental 
funding for the war. The Democratic 
leader might think a few days here 
don’t mean much, don’t matter much. 
Every day they stall to appease left-
wing activists is another day our military 
must wait for the funding it needs 
to win this war. 
Madam Speaker, I admonish Speaker 
PELOSI to quit playing politics with our 


H4214 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

national security. Let Congress vote on 
a clean funding bill for our troops. The 
Democratic leaders may be content to 
lose the war, but the troops are in 
harm’s way, and they certainly will 
not lose this war. 

f 

THE PRESIDENT NEEDS OUR HELP 
(Mr. KAGEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to remind everyone here and 
throughout the country that our President 
needs our help. The President 
needs our help to support our troops 
before, during, and after serving in 
harm’s way, and to guarantee our soldiers 
receive everything necessary to 
heal their wounds from battles fought 
on our behalf. 
The President needs our help to fulfill 
Abe Lincoln’s promise to our veterans, 
to care for him who shall have 
borne the battle and for his widow and 
orphans. The President needs our help 
to hold the freely elected Iraqi Government 
accountable to his own benchmarks. 
And the President needs our 
help to accept the new direction away 
from Iraq back towards al Qaeda. 
The people of Wisconsin urge the 
President to sign the Iraqi Accountability 
Act, for in doing so he will be 
able to once again tell our troops and 
all the American people: ‘‘Mission Accomplished.’’ 
Mr. President, the American people 
hope you will accept our help. 

f 

IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL—THE 
WRONG WAY FORWARD 

(Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 
minute.) 

Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, the 
Democrats’ Iraq supplemental bill is 
the wrong policy for America and the 
wrong signal to send our troops in 
harm’s way. 

The Democrats’ attempt to micromanage 
the war accomplishes nothing 
of strategic value. Rather, by meddling 
in the decisions which are best left to 
our commanders on the ground, they 
merely succeeded in telegraphing our 
plans to the enemy. 

Setting deadlines and tying the 
hands of our generals is not a plan for 
success and not a safe way to conduct 
this war. Congress, an inherent political 
body, should not be dictating military 
strategy. Rather than support a 
bill that leaves our troops in harm’s 
way for a cause Democrats believe cannot 
be won, a bill the President has 
promised to veto, the Democratic leaders 
should be willing to vote up or 
down on a clean bill that supports 
funding the global war on terrorism. 

f 

TIME FOR A CHANGE IN COURSE 

(Mr. DEFAZIO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 

Mr. DEFAZIO. The Republican minority 
would say take the advice of the 
professionals. Well, if this administration 
had taken the advice of the military 
professionals, remember General 
Shinseki, ‘‘400,000 troops on the ground 
or you’ll have an insurgency,’’ they 
fired him because he talked about reality. 


From day one they’ve been dumb: firing 
Shinseki; delusional: ‘‘we’ll be 
greeted as liberators’’ and the war will 
be short; and deliberately deceptive: 
Saddam Hussein had links to 9/11 and 
they had weapons of mass destruction. 

It’s time for a change in course. They 
want status quo, stay the course. It’s 
not working. Our troops are mired in 
the middle of a civil war. Someone 
needs to take the role of leadership 
here. It’s not going to be Bush and CHENEY. 
It can be the United States Congress 
reasserting itself as a third co-
equal branch of government and the 
only branch which has the authority to 
declare war and set limits. Yes, set 
limits on a war, and bring it to an end. 

f 

IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL 
(Mr. KLINE of Minnesota asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. KLINE of Minnesota. Madam 
Speaker, House Republicans believe 
that our commanders on the ground in 
Iraq deserve to have the resources and 
flexibility they need to lead our troops 
in harm’s way during this critical 
phase of their mission. 
On the other hand, Washington 
Democrats would rather use our troops 
to make a political statement than 
work in a bipartisan fashion to get our 
brave men and women in uniform the 
funding they need to succeed in their 
mission. 
I thought the San Diego Union Tribune 
made a good point in an editorial 
stating: ‘‘And even though this sham 
bill is merely a political show, the 
Democratic majorities in the House 
and Senate managed to lard it up in 
nearly $25 billion in wasteful pork, 
most of it entirely unrelated to war 
funding.’’ 
It’s time the Democratic leadership 
send the President a clean supplemental. 
It is simply unacceptable for 
Democrat leaders to restrict the necessary 
funds our troops need so political 
points can be scored with their defeatist 
base. 

f 

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED 
(Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, 4 
years ago, the President declared: 
‘‘Mission Accomplished.’’ I would ask 
the President, Madam Speaker, whose 
mission was accomplished by the invasion 
and occupation of Iraq? Was 
Halliburton’s mission accomplished? 

Was the oil companies’ mission accomplished? 
Was the defense contractors’ 
mission accomplished? 

I was at Arlington Cemetery this 
morning where so many of our brave 
young men and women responded to 
the call of duty. Their mission was to 
put their lives on the line for America. 
They accomplished their mission. This 
Congress has not accomplished its mission. 


We must stop funding the war. We 
must end the occupation. We must use 
the money in the pipeline to bring our 
troops home. We must reach out to the 
nations of the region to create an 
international peacekeeping and security 
force to stabilize Iraq. And we 
must bring to justice under our Constitution 
and under the laws of this Nation 
those in high office who took us 
into a war based on lies. Then we will 
have accomplished our mission. Then 
we will have restored America’s honor, 
America’s greatness.

U.S. COURTS VS. WORLD COURT 
(Mr. POE asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, teenagers 
Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pena 
were viciously raped, beaten, strangled 
and stomped to death by six gang members 
in Houston in 1993. One of these 
killers, Mexican national Jose Ernesto 
Medellin, was given the death penalty. 
But the World Court claims that 
Medellin was denied access to the 
Mexican consulate during his arrest. 
The U.S. administration sided with the 
World Court in Mexico and ordered 
Texas to hold a new hearing for 
Medellin based on a treaty the United 
States signed in 1969. But the Texas 
court, highest Texas court, ruled 9–0 
the administration had no constitutional 
authority to order Texas courts 
to do anything; upheld the conviction, 
ordered the execution, especially because 
Medellin never objected at trial 
that he did not see his consulate. The 
killer, with the support of the administration 
and Mexico, has appealed the 
Texas court decision to the United 
States Supreme Court. One wonders 
why the administration is siding with 
Mexico over the American court system. 
Madam Speaker, the ironic thing is 
the United States has withdrawn the 
consulate treaty provision. The United 
States justice system and the sovereignty 
of the United States Constitution 
should be paramount to the wishes 
of Mexico, the World Court and the administration. 
The Supreme Court 
should uphold this valid conviction and 
not give in to the wishes of Foreign 
Courts. 
And that’s just the way it is.

EITHER WE DO OUR JOB OR WE 
DON’T 
(Mr. WELCH of Vermont asked and 
was given permission to address the 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4215 

House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 

Mr. WELCH of Vermont. Last week, 
the Government Reform and Oversight 
Committee voted to subpoena Secretary 
Rice and it was faced, the committee, 
with a simple question. We 
could do our job or not. 

There is no question, no question 
that the intelligence used by the administration 
to justify the war in Iraq 
was dead wrong. Secretary Rice was 
the administration’s principal spokesperson, 
and under her leadership the 
administration was certain but wrong 
about the Niger claim; certain but 
wrong about the aluminum tubes, certain 
but wrong about the al Qaeda connection, 
about the mobile labs, about 
unmanned aerial vehicles. And there 
are now three questions that Congress 
must answer. How did the White House 
and Secretary Rice have such confidence 
they were so right when, in 
fact, they were so wrong? How can we 
protect the American people and U.S. 
military from such misinformation in 
the future? And was the administration’s 
active dissemination of bad intelligence 
premeditated and deliberate, 
done with the intention to deceive the 
American people, or was it reckless and 
cavalier, done to justify a decision to 
go to war that had already been made?

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED 

(Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. PENCE. As we’ve heard this 
morning, Madam Speaker, 4 years ago 
today, aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, 
President Bush gave a speech. 
Now, it has been characterized by 
Members of Congress this morning that 
the President ‘‘announced ‘mission accomplished.’’’ 
And one other speaker 
said that the President ‘‘declared ‘mission 
accomplished.’’’ Actually, here’s 
what the President said, and I am 
quoting: ‘‘We have difficult work to do 
in Iraq. We’re bringing order to parts of 
the country that remain dangerous.’’ 
But he added, ‘‘our mission continues. 
Al Qaeda is wounded, not destroyed. 
The enemies of freedom are not idle 
and neither are we, and we will continue 
to hunt down the enemy before 
he can strike.’’ 

The President said, ‘‘the battle of 
Iraq is one victory in a war of terror 
that began September 11 and still goes 
on.’’ 

As the President said 4 years ago, 
Madam Speaker, ‘‘our mission is not 
accomplished in Iraq or in the war on 
terror.’’ So now is not the time to tie 
the funding for our troops to deadlines 
and defeat. Now is not the time for 
politicians in Washington, D.C. to 
micromanage and make decisions for 
our commanders in the field. 

Mr. President, veto this bill. 

IT’S TIME FOR SOME 
ACCOUNTABILITY IN IRAQ 

(Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
today Congress will send President 
Bush an emergency war supplemental 
that finally begins moving this war in 
a new direction. 

Four years ago today, the Bush administration 
sent out a message of 
‘‘Mission Accomplished’’ in Iraq. But 
our mission was not accomplished. Instead, 
for 4 years, the President has 
stumbled, and past Republican Congresses 
refused to hold the administration 
accountable for its miscues and 
mistakes. Well, those days are over 
now. 

Our legislation brings real accountability 
to the war. It provides accountability 
to our soldiers who were sent 
into battle without proper equipment 
or a clear mission. It provides accountability 
to our veterans who are not getting 
the best medical care when they 
come home, and to our military that is 
stretched to the limits by the current 
Bush war policy. And it finally holds 
the Iraqi government accountable to 
meet the benchmarks the President 
has created. 

Madam Speaker, the American people 
want this war to move in a new direction. 
The President should sign the 
bill today.

DEMOCRAT DECLARATION OF 
DEFEAT 

(Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of California 
asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and 
to revise and extend his remarks.) 

Mr. DANIEL E. LUNGREN of California. 
Madam Speaker, we come to 
this floor as representatives of our constituents, 
of the American people. And 
I am astonished to hear some of the 
comments on this floor. We can disagree 
in terms of policies. We can disagree 
in terms of decisions, but to go 
from that to suggest lies, to suggest 
deception, to have a distinguished 
Member on the other side of the aisle 
say this past weekend that we ought to 
consider impeachment of the President, 
this declaration of defeat from 
the Democrats that is sent to the 
President’s desk today ought to be vetoed 
by this President. 

General Petraeus was here last week 
presenting to us his view of what’s happening. 
And, frankly, I think General 
Petraeus has a better idea what we 
need to do than any other erstwhile 
general sitting here in the halls of Congress. 


We can only have one Commander in 
Chief. We had a unanimous decision in 
the Senate to send General Petraeus 
there and yet, now you are trying to 
undercut his mission by this Democratic 
declaration of defeat. 

Let us have the President veto it as 
soon as possible. 

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED 

(Ms. SHEA-PORTER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 

Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Madam Speaker, 
4 years ago today, 4 long years ago 
today, we heard ‘‘Mission Accomplished.’’ 
What mission? We are not 
even sure what the mission is anymore, 
the President has changed the mission 
so many times. 

But I have to tell America the truth 
about this war. I sit on the Armed 
Services Committee, and I’m tired of 
hearing what I hear every hearing. 
What am I hearing? I’m hearing that 
the American military is strained to 
the breaking point. I’m hearing that 88 
percent of our National Guard is not 
ready to be sent. I’m hearing that 
we’re having problems with equipment. 
I’m hearing problems from military 
families. What I’m hearing is that at 
the top leadership, we have failed the 
military and we have failed the people 
of the United States. We need to get a 
grip on this. 

The Democrats have presented the 
White House with a responsible exit 
from Iraq. We need leadership here. 
The President has failed to show that 
leadership, but the Democrats are prepared 
now to give that responsible road 
map out of Iraq. 

I urge the President to sign this legislation.

WAR IS AN UGLY THING 

(Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 

Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, 
you know, nobody likes war. I don’t 
like it. My constituents from Fort 
Campbell that are fighting this war, 
they don’t like it. But they understand 
it. 

And we all know there are some 
things worth fighting for. Freedom is 
one of those things. Freedom is one of 
those things. 

Listen to this from British historian 
John Stuart Mill. He said back in the 
1800s, ‘‘War is an ugly thing, not the 
ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded 
state of moral and patriotic 
feeling which thinks that nothing is 
worth war is much worse.’’ People that 
don’t care, that is what is worse. 

Using our troops as a political tool 
during a time of war is not wrong. It is 
ugly. It is downright ugly. It is wrong, 
and it jeopardizes our national security. 
Just yesterday, Iraq’s Ambassador 
to the U.S. said American troops are 
critical to the success of that. 

Today we stand and recognize the demise 
of al Masri, the leader of al Qaeda 
in Iraq. Tenacity. Focus. That is what 
yields results. Our men and women are 
getting results. It should be the first 
priority. We should all be reading this 
bill. We should recognize war is ugly. 

Veto the bill, Mr. President.

HONORING THE CAREER AND RESEARCH 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF 
FRANCES E. ALLEN, THE 2006 RECIPIENT 
OF THE A.M. TURING 
AWARD 

(Mr. HALL of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 

Mr. HALL of New York. Madam 
Speaker, on a different subject, regarding 
H. Con. Res. 95, I thank my colleague, 
Ms. WOOLSEY from California, 
for introducing this resolution honoring 
Dr. Frances Allen. 

Through her years of groundbreaking 
work at IBM, Frances Allen has been 
described as a pioneer, teacher, mentor 
and friend, and I am proud to say a 
constituent of mine in New York’s 19th 
District. Now, the A.M. Turing award 
winner can be added to that last list. 

The A.M. Turing award is considered 
to be the Nobel Prize of computing, and 
I cannot think of an individual more 
deserving than Frances Allen. Her 
work has been groundbreaking; not an 
exaggeration to say it’s been part of 
one of the great technological revolutions 
in history. 

Over the course of her career, 
Frances Allen’s long journey took her 
from a teacher of FORTRAN to a nationally 
recognized leader in computer 
science. 

At IBM’s T.J. Watson Research Center 
in Hawthorne, New York, her research 
and development of program 
languages and algorithms helped to 
create the theory of optimization and 
laid the foundation for much of today’s 
compilers and high performance computing 
systems. 

Her work has been a bridge from the 
theoretical to the practical in the computer 
science. 

Just as her work has been pioneering, 
Frances herself has been a pioneer in 
advancing the role of women in computer 
science. 

An Advisory Council Member of the 
Anita Borg Institute for Women in 
Technology, whose goal it is to increase 
the participation of women in 
all aspects of technology, she has 
worked tirelessly to help more women 
enter the field, and has served as a role 
model for women and men hoping to 
make new breakthroughs in computing. 


In 1989, she was the first woman to be 
given prestigious title of IBM fellow. It 
would seem fitting then that she is also 
the first woman to receive the A.M. 
Turing award. 

Described as a strong mentor, and 
noted for her willingness to lend her 
expertise, advice and experience to 
anyone, from a struggling graduate 
student to a university president to an 

industry executive. Through it all, 
she’s been willing to stand up for what 
she believes in, and has had a remarkable 
career. 

Dr. Allen is a great source of pride 
for the Hudson Valley, and I congratulate 
her for receiving the prestigious 

A.M. Turing award.

OPERATION HOMEFRONT MAKING 
A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE 

(Mr. PRICE of Georgia asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 

Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, as the contentious and sometimes 
ugly debate over our strategy in 
Iraq continues here in Washington, it’s 
important to remember that there are 
patriotic Americans helping with positive 
activity abroad and at home. And 
today it’s my privilege to acknowledge 
the incredible work being done by some 
folks in my State of Georgia and all 
across this Nation. Operation Home-
front is a national nonprofit organization 
founded in the wake of September 

11. The decent and committed Americans 
at Operation Homefront are providing 
necessary assistance and comfort 
to our troops and their family. 
Through financial assistance programs 
and other goods and services, 
these tireless volunteers are helping 
America’s military families cope with 
the everyday difficulties that they 
face. They are truly making a difference. 


Our military families deserve nothing 
less than the unending gratitude 
and support of our entire Nation. 
Thanks to Operation Homefront for 
their efforts. I encourage every American 
to get involved. And let’s show our 
military men and women that we 
honor their sacrifice, and we will never 
forget all that they do to defend our 
freedom at home and abroad.

IRAQ 
(Mr. HOLT asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, 4 years 
ago, President Bush used soldiers and 
sailors as stage props to declare ‘‘Major 
combat operations in Iraq have ended.’’ 
Those combat operations indeed, 
should have ended, in fact, they should 
never have begun. This combat was 
constitutionally and strategically unjustifiable, 
operationally poorly executed 
with regard to armoring and deploying 
the troops, and politically and 
diplomatically disastrous. 
This war is not making anyone safer 
or more free and it cannot be won militarily. 
As retired General Odom said, 
‘‘The challenge we face today is not 
how to win in Iraq; it is how to recover 
from a strategic mistake: invading Iraq 
in the first place.’’ 
The President continues to squander 
American influence, blood and treasure. 
The President’s intransigence is 

why our Congress was forced to pass a 
spending bill that forces a change in 
course in Iraq. The President needs to 
know that the days of congressional 
blank checks in support of a failed policy 
are over. 

f 

IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL 
(Mr. LAMBORN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, 
time is running out to send our troops 
the funds and resources they need to 
continue their critical mission in Iraq. 
It is time to pass a porkless supplemental 
bill aimed at victory rather 
than defeat. 
The National Intelligence Estimate 
released in January warned of the perils 
of an early troop withdrawal stating, 
‘‘If coalition forces were withdrawn 
rapidly during the term of this 
estimate, we judge that this almost 
certainly would lead to a significant 
increase in the scale and scope of sectarian 
conflict in Iraq.’’ 
Many on the other side of the aisle 
urge Congress to heed the other warnings 
in this document, yet they willfully 
ignore this particular warning. 
They prefer a strategy that would tie 
the hands of our military commanders 
on the ground, removing our troops and 
continuing a defeatist policy of cut and 
run. 
It is obvious to me that Washington 
Democrats would exploit our troops to 
make a political statement rather than 
work in a bipartisan fashion to provide 
our brave men and women in uniform 
the funding they need. 
Madam Speaker, it is time we vote a 
clean supplemental to give our troops 
the support they must have.

NEW DIRECTION IN IRAQ 
(Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, 
it is absolutely correct: 4 years ago 
President Bush stood before this sign 
declaring ‘‘Mission Accomplished,’’ but 
today he insists on staying the course. 
To accomplish our own mission, President 
Bush needs to listen. He needs to 
listen to the retired military generals 
who support the approach of this Congress. 
Retired MG Paul Eaton said, ‘‘This 
bill gives General Petraeus great leverage 
for moving the Iraqi Government 
down the more disciplined path laid 
out by the Iraq Study Group. 
LTG William Odom said, ‘‘The bill 
gives the President a chance to pull 
back from a disastrous course, reorient 

U.S. strategy to achieve regional stability, 
and win help from many other 
countries, the only way peace will 
eventually be achieved.’’ 
Major General Montano said the bill 
‘‘not only reflects the thinking of the 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4217 

Iraq Study Group but puts teeth to the 
phrase of ‘supporting our troops.’’’ 

Madam Speaker, the President needs 
to listen. He needs to listen to these retired 
generals. 

And, Mr. President, I will not address 
you directly, but I would ask you, 
Madam Speaker, to allow me to say 
that the bill will be on his desk this 
afternoon.

URGING A CLEAN IRAQ 
EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL 

(Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee 
asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 

Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, here we are again. Another 
week has gone by, and we are 
still discussing the Iraq emergency 
supplemental. The Democrats were 
successful in forwarding a strategy of 
cut and run, knowing the entire time 
their strategy would be vetoed by the 
President. 

It is an ill-conceived idea to state 
you support the troops on the one hand 
while on the other hand you push forward 
with legislation that you know 
has no chance of gaining the President’s 
support. I believe the Democrat 
leadership owes the American people 
an explanation of why they would do 
this. 

Time is up and the Democrats need 
to come back to the realization that 
our troops don’t deserve to be caught 
in the political mess between the radical 
left and the rest of the Democrat 
Party. It is time for a clean supplemental 
to come to the floor so that we 
can send the President a bill that supports 
our troops without handcuffing 
our generals and withdrawing our 
troops before this critical mission is 
complete.

THE IRAQ WAR 

(Mr. MCDERMOTT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 

Mr. MCDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, 4 
years after the banner was unfurled, 
these are the missions that have been 
accomplished by the President: 

America is more divided than at any 
time since the Vietnam War. The Iraq 
Government has before it a sweetheart 
deal that benefits Big Oil that the U.S. 
brokered behind the scenes. Read Josh 
Holland’s investigative piece on 
alternet.com; 

America is increasingly isolated in 
the Arab world, and countries that 

looked up to America now look out or 
look the other way. Read Rami 
Khouri’s commentary published in the 
April 19 issue of the Daily Star in Lebanon; 


The number of Pentagon contractors 
in Iraq who are profiting in the spoils 
of war, raking in vast sums of U.S. taxpayer 
money, nearly equals the number 
of U.S. soldiers. Read ‘‘Iraq War: a Nice 
Little Earner’’ in the Asia Times newspaper 
dated April 19; 

Americans are so fed up with the 
President’s state of denial that they returned 
Democratic majorities to the 
House and Senate last November. Read 
the April 26 editorial in my hometown 
newspaper, the Seattle PI: ‘‘Iraq: Keep 
Speaking Out.’’ 

Missions accomplished? All but the 
most important one: getting U.S. soldiers 
out of Iraq. 

That is the will of the American people 
and the mission of the new Congress. 


f 

IT IS TIME THE DEMOCRAT LEAD


ERSHIP PUT OUR TROOPS, NOT 

POLITICAL STATEMENTS, FIRST 

(Mr. CARTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. CARTER. Madam Speaker, now 
that the Democrats have satisfied their 
base and passed a bill that is guaranteed 
to be vetoed and delayed the necessary 
funding for our troops, we need 
to get down to business and pass a 
clean supplemental. 

Yesterday I received a letter from a 
marine mom. She said she was embarrassed 
and saddened by the fact that 
somebody would leave her son and 
those fighting forces that are doing 
such a wonderful job in harm’s way 
without funding their needs as they 
fight the battle for freedom. This lady 
was heart broken that a portion of this 
Congress would vote not to provide a 
clean bill for her son’s protection. 

The Chicago Tribune editorial says 
that President Bush is going to veto 
this spending bill because it has a 
timetable for withdrawal, and it goes 
on to say: ‘‘He is right to do so.’’ 

We have a new commanding general 
on the ground and he has a plan, and 
that plan has not even started to be executed. 
We are already seeing modest 
improvements. 

I urge my colleagues, and that marine 
mom urges my colleagues, to support 
a clean supplemental. It is time 
the Democrat leadership put our 
troops, not political statements, first. 

f 

THE IRAQ WAR 
(Mr. MAHONEY of Florida asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, on Sunday in a speech at 
Miami Dade College, the President said 
to graduating students, ‘‘One of the 
great strengths of America is that the 

most important issues are decided by 
the will of the people.’’ 

Today, on the fourth anniversary of 
‘‘Mission Accomplished,’’ the President 
is faced with a choice: either listen to 
the will of the American people to 
refocus our strengths to win the war on 
terror by signing the emergency supplemental 
bill or continue to send our 
brave men and women into harm’s way 
to police a religious civil war. 

Madam Speaker, today the President 
will decide if he will veto our bill and, 
in doing so, deny critical funding for 
our troops and for our veterans. His 
veto will let our troops down by not 
giving them the rest, the equipment, 
and training they need. 

Madam Speaker, today all Americans 
need to pray for our President. We need 
to pray for wisdom. We need to pray 
that he listens to his advisers, his generals, 
the Iraqi people. And, most importantly, 
we pray that he will listen 
to the will of the American people.

SEND THE PRESIDENT A CLEAN 

BILL THAT GIVES OUR TROOPS 

THE MONEY THEY NEED 

(Mr. WESTMORELAND asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 

Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam 
Speaker, we’ve got the lights. We’ve 
got the cameras. We’ve got the characters 
for some fine political theater in 
the House of Representatives today. 

Last week this Congress passed an 
ill-conceived, wrong-headed, ill-fated 
war funding bill, even though every 
Member of this House knew the President 
would veto it, even though our 
troops are on the front lines of a war 
awaiting this funding. 

And while the troops face fire, the 
Democratic leaders fiddled. They 
slowed down the process even more by 
sitting on the bill for days. 

Madam Speaker, it’s time for the majority 
to change out of their costumes, 
take down the curtain, take their bow, 
and exit stage left because Americans 
don’t want to see the last act of this 
Democratic script that calls for waving 
the white flag of surrender. 

We owe it to our Nation and to our 
troops to change the ending of the 
story. Send the President a clean bill 
and give the troops the money they 
need to do the job. And they will be 
victorious.

URGING SUPPORT FOR A CLEAN 

IRAQ EMERGENCY SUPPLE


MENTAL BILL 

(Mr. SMITH of Nebraska asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 


H4218 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, it is my hope that we can 
come together and agree on an Iraq 
emergency supplemental that provides 
the resources our troops need without 
tying the hands of our generals and 
forcing them to adhere to unrealistic 
timetables. 

Last week in a Chicago Tribune editorial, 
they stated: ‘‘President Bush 
will veto the war spending bill approved 
by Congress this week because 
it contains a timetable for withdrawing 

U.S. combat troops from Iraq. He is 
right to do so.’’ 
With a new commanding general on 
the ground and the surge strategy still 
ramping up, our troops deserve this 
chance to make progress, and we are 
starting to see signs in Iraq that things 
are modestly improving. 

I urge my colleagues to support a 
clean supplemental and to encourage 
patience as we heard 4 years ago before 
we even went to Iraq that this would be 
a long time coming, that our ultimate 
goal in accomplishing victory in Iraq 
would take some time. We need to listen 
to those comments, and, again, I 
urge patience. 

f 

THE IRAQ EMERGENCY 
SUPPLEMENTAL 

(Ms. SUTTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) 


Ms. SUTTON. Madam Speaker, the 
American people have demanded a new 
direction in Iraq, and last week this 
Congress voted to put an end to the administration’s 
failed stay-the-course 
policy. 

The President should support our 
troops and sign this responsible bill instead 
of issuing veto threats that continue 
to ignore the reality of our 
troops’ being caught in the middle of a 
civil war. It is ironic that we are expecting 
the President to veto this bill 
to bring our troops home 4 years to the 
day after he declared the job done in 
Iraq. It is time for accountability from 
the administration and from the Iraqi 
Government. 

Our bill provides what the American 
people are demanding and what our 
troops need: a responsible policy that 
funds our troops, demands accountability 
from the administration and 
the Iraqi Government, and supports 
our veterans. 

The President should listen to Congress. 
Sign this bill, take the funding, 
and accept accountability. 

f 

TIME IS RUNNING OUT: SEND OUR 
TROOPS THE FUNDS THEY NEED 

(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 

Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, 
time is running out to send our troops 
the funds and resources they need to 
continue their critical mission in Iraq. 

The new congressional majority ensured 
the veto the President promised 

by submitting a supplemental loaded 
with pork and a timeline for retreat on 
our commanders in the field. Now it’s 
time to pass a clean supplemental. 

The National Intelligence Estimate 
released in January warned of the perils 
of an early troop withdrawal, stating: 
‘‘If coalition forces were withdrawn 
rapidly during the term of this 
estimate, we judge that this almost 
certainly would lead to a significant 
increase in the scale and scope of sectarian 
conflict in Iraq.’’ 

Many on the other side of the aisle 
urge Congress to heed the words in this 
document; yet they stare blindly at it 
as they force a strategy of retreat and 
defeat. This leads me to believe that 
the new congressional majority would 
rather use our troops to make a political 
statement than work in bipartisan 
fashion to give our brave men and 
women in uniform the funding they 
need. 

It’s time we vote on a clean supplemental 
and give the troops the support 
they deserve.

FOUR YEARS AGO IT WAS MISSION 
ACCOMPLISHED; NOW IT IS THE 
NEVER-ENDING, EVER-CHANGING 
MISSION 

(Mr. ELLISON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 

Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, 
today we insist, we ask, the President 
to fund the troops by not vetoing this 
bill. We ask the President to sign the 
bill. 

What has been described as pork is 
not pork. What it is, is money for traumatic 
brain injury. What it is, is 
money for veterans who are suffering, 
who have serious problems and serious 
needs for funding. 

The President has received more 
money than he even asked for for these 
troops, and we insist and ask him to 
sign the bill so that the troops can get 
the money that they need. It is going 
to be on his desk. The funds that the 
President needs will be on his desk. 
And if the President vetoes the bill, it 
will be the President who denies the 
troops the funds that they need. The 
President must accept responsibility 
for denying the troops the help that 
they need, veterans the help that they 
need. 

Madam Speaker, we urge the community 
to understand the truth about the 
situation, which is that a veto is undermining 
the troops.

IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL 

(Mr. SHUSTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 

Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Speaker, our 
enemies are listening, and they are 
planning on our actions today, just 
like the North Vietnamese did decades 
ago. And don’t believe me, but listen to 

the words of Colonel Bui Tin, who 
served on the general’s staff of the 
North Vietnamese Army and received 
the unconditional surrender of South 
Vietnam on April 30, 1975. 

In an interview with The Wall Street 
Journal in 1995, he drew some important 
parallels to the debate today. 
When asked how the North Vietnamese 
intended to defeat America, Colonel 
Tin responded, ‘‘by fighting a long war 
which would break their will to help 
South Vietnam.’’ He went on to quote 
Ho Chi Minh, who said, ‘‘We don’t need 
to win military victories, we only need 
to hit them until they give up and get 
out.’’ Colonel Tin said the American 
antiwar movement was essential to 
their strategy. He said it represented 
the conscience of America and the conscience 
of America was part of its war-
making capability, and we were turning 
that power in our favor. 

Through protests, America lost its 
ability to mobilize a will to win. That 
is what this supplemental does here 
today. Let’s listen to the past and not 
repeat its mistakes. Let’s pass a clean 
bill and give our soldiers what they 
need to win. 

f 

IRAQ TIMETABLE AND FUNDING 

(Ms. SOLIS asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) 


Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, I would 
just like to say that there has been a 
lot of talk about Democrats cutting 
and running and not helping our 
troops. Well, I would like to clarify the 
record on my own behalf. 

Just a month ago, I had an opportunity, 
with four other Members of 
Congress, to visit Iraq, to visit our soldiers. 
I met with many, many platoons 
and individuals representing my State 
of California. We are there working 
hard. We need to support those troops. 

Indeed, many of them said that they 
have been on their second and third 
tours. They were exhausted. They 
wanted to come home and see their 
families. One young man told me he 
hadn’t even seen his child, who had 
been born 18 months already. Several 
of them told me that they did not have 
adequate equipment. And I said please 
explain that. ‘‘Well, ma’am, we don’t 
have light bulbs.’’ ‘‘What do you need 
light bulbs for?’’ ‘‘We need light bulbs 
for our vehicles. When we go into town 
and we are checking for explosive devices, 
we have vehicles that are not 
adequately equipped.’’ 

In addition, with the escalation going 
on right now, they are having to share 
their equipment with the troops that 
are coming in. That is shameful. That 
is what this administration has done to 
our troops. 

Democrats are asking for a signature 
on the supplemental because we care 
about those troops and we care about 
the benefits that they deserve. 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4219 

FOUR YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF 
‘‘MISSION ACCOMPLISHED’’ 

(Mr. PASCRELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 

Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, 
1,460 days ago, we had lost 139 troops, 
brave men and women, in Iraq. 1,460 
days later, Sergeant Michael Hullender 
from my district, from Little Falls, 
New Jersey, died on Saturday when an 
IED detonated near his patrol. He is 
one of 3,214 more troops that have died 
since supposedly major operations 
would cease. 

The President made the Iraqi people 
believe that a new day of democracy 
was dawning and that brighter times 
lay ahead. Even the reconstruction of 
Iraq has gone awry. Even the reconstruction 
has been bought by the filthy 
hands of contractors who are concerned 
only for profit. 

The President made the American 
people believe that the war was over, 
that the thousands of sailors who stood 
on the deck of that aircraft carrier 
that day were coming home soon. They 
did not. 

The President has an opportunity to 
mend his ways this afternoon. Let’s see 
what he does.

HONORING THE CAREER AND RE


SEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF 

FRANCES E. ALLEN 

Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and agree to 
the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 

95) honoring the career and research 
accomplishments of Frances E. Allen, 
the 2006 recipient of the A.M. Turing 
Award, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the concurrent 
resolution. 
The text of the concurrent resolution 
is as follows: 

H. CON. RES. 95 
Whereas Frances Allen joined IBM in 1957 
early in the history of the computer industry 
and just after an IBM team developed 
Fortran, one of the first high-level programming 
languages; 
Whereas Frances Allen during her 45 year 
career at IBM rose from being a teacher of 
Fortran to highest level of IBM technologists; 
Whereas in 1989 Frances Allen was the first 
woman to be named an IBM Fellow and in 
1995 became President of the IBM Academy 
of Technology, a global organization of IBM 
technical leaders charged with providing 
technical advice to the company; 
Whereas Frances Allen made fundamental 
contributions to the theory and practice of 

program optimization, which translates the 
users’ problem-solving language statements; 

Whereas Frances Allen’s work led to remarkable 
advances in compiler design and 
machine architecture that are at the foundation 
of modern high-performance computing; 

Whereas Frances Allen’s unique dedication 
to meeting the needs of her customers led to 
IBM’s innovation model; 

Whereas Frances Allen is nationally renowned 
for her work in encouraging women 
to study computer science; 

Whereas the Association for Computing 
Machinery, an international organization of 
computing professionals, gives the A.M. 
Turing Award annually to individuals whose 
contributions in the field of computing are 
long-lasting and are of major technical importance; 
and 

Whereas Frances Allen has now been honored 
as the first woman recipient of the 
Turing Award, computer science’s most prestigious 
award, which is equated by some to 
the Nobel Prizes: Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved by the House of Representatives (the 
Senate concurring), That the Congress honors 
the pioneering life work of Frances Allen in 
computer research and development and salutes 
the Turing Award Committee for recognizing, 
through the selection of Frances 
Allen, that creative women have contributed 
mightily to the development of this important 
field. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WOOLSEY) and the gentleman 
from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH) 
each will control 20 minutes. 

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman 
from California. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to include 
extraneous material on H. Con. 
Res. 95, the resolution now under consideration. 


The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentlewoman 
from California? 

There was no objection. 

Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may consume. 


Madam Speaker, H. Con. Res. 95 honors 
a pioneer in the world of computing, 
Dr. Frances Allen, the first 
woman awarded the A.M. Turing 
Award by the Association for Computing 
Machinery, ACM. The Turing 
Award is widely considered to be the 
Nobel Prize of computing. By being the 
first female recipient, Dr. Allen has set 
the bar as a role model for women everywhere 
who aspire to a career in 
math and science. 

As a scientist at IBM since the early 
1960s, Dr. Allen pioneered new technologies 
which serve as the basis for 
complex theories which are widely used 
today throughout the computer industry. 
She is regarded as a pioneer in the 
field of optimizing compilers and has 
developed several programming languages 
that have advanced the field of 
computer science. 

Dr. Allen also helped create one of 
the first automatic debugging systems, 
and developed the advanced code-
breaking language known as Alpha, 

which revolutionized how computers 
talk to each other and make computer 
programmers more efficient. 

As computer science was ramping up 
in the early 1980s, Dr. Allen founded 
the Parallel Translation Group, the 
PTRAN, to study compiling for parallel 
machines. Subsequently, this group 
was recognized as one of the top research 
groups in the world dealing with 
this issue, and as a result, Dr. Allen 
was the first woman to be recognized 
as an IBM fellow in 1989. 

In addition to her outstanding scientific 
achievement, Dr. Allen has also 
been an inspirational mentor to younger 
researchers and a leader within the 
computing community. 

With the Nation’s information technology 
workforce suffering from a lack 
of qualified candidates, it is all the 
more important, Madam Speaker, that 
Dr. Allen be recognized as the first female 
recipient of the A.M. Turing 
Award to show what women can accomplish. 


It is certainly telling that women 
who earn more than half of all undergraduate 
degrees in this country and 
make up more than half of the professional 
workforce represent only 25 percent 
of all high-tech workers. In fact, 
the percentage of women graduating 
with degrees in computer science has 
fallen from 37 percent of total graduates 
in 1985 to just 15 percent in 2005. 
With grim statistics like these, it is 
clear that we are going to close the gap 
and ensure that information technology 
sectors have enough workers 
only if we get young women into this 
workplace. And Dr. Allen has done just 
that. 

As a member of the Advisory Council 
of the Anita Borg Institute for Women 
and Technology, her goal has been to 
increase the participation of women in 
all aspects of technology. With her accomplishments 
in computing, it is 
clear that Dr. Allen lives up to the 
goals she sets for others and is a role 
model for women in science and technology. 


Madam Speaker, Dr. Frances Allen 
has succeeded at the highest levels of 
math and science. It is clear that she 
deserves recognition for all of the tireless 
work she has done to promote 
women’s roles in computing. 

I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, not only in congratulating Dr. 
Allen on her success, but to show that 
this Congress supports an increased 
presence of women in science and technology. 


Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to honor and congratulate 
Frances E. Allen, the 2006 recipient 
of the A.M. Turing Award. 

The Turing Award, established in 
1966, is given annually by the Association 
for Computing Machinery to individuals 
whose work has been of lasting 
and major technical importance to the 
computer field. Fran Allen is richly deserving 
of this honor. She is also the 
first woman to receive the award. 


H4220 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

Fran Allen exemplifies the dedication 
and innovative spirit that has 
brought this country to the forefront 
of science, technology and commerce. 
As a researcher for IBM for nearly 45 
years, she played a key role in building 
the high-performance computing world 
we live in today. 

Her work on optimization of parallel 
processing has impacted all of our 
lives, for example, by setting the stage 
for today’s computer systems that 
forecast our weather and analyze DNA 
sequences. 

I would like to particularly commend 
Ms. Allen for her dedication to supporting 
and mentoring young men and 
women in her field. I note that after 
her retirement from IBM, she kept an 
office and has continued her work mentoring 
future leaders in computer 
sciences and, hopefully, future A.M. 
Turing Award winners as well. 

As this Congress looks to improve 
our Nation’s competitiveness and looks 
to provide for the next generation of 
scientists, engineers and business men 
and women, we should consider the 
great example that Fran Allen has 
given to us. 

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues 
to support H. Con. Res. 95 and 
join me in congratulating Fran Allen 
today. 

With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 

Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, as a 
member of the Committee on Science 
and Technology, I am proud to have 
brought H. Con. Res. 95 to the floor 
today. 

Dr. Allen has contributed much to 
the world of science and technology. 
She is most deserving of this honor, 
and we are extending to her today our 
congratulations. 

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
WOOLSEY) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, 
H. Con. Res. 95, as amended. 

The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the concurrent 
resolution, as amended, was 
agreed to. 

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

RECOGNIZING NOBEL PRIZE 
RECIPIENTS IN SCIENCE 

Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and agree to 
the resolution (H. Res. 316) recognizing 
the accomplishments of Roger D. 
Kornberg, Andrew Fire, Craig Mello, 
John C. Mather, and George F. Smoot 
for being awarded Nobel Prizes in the 
fields of chemistry, physiology or medicine, 
and physics. 

The Clerk read the title of the resolution. 


The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. RES. 316 
Whereas, according to the National Academies 
landmark report ‘‘Rising Above the 
Gathering Storm’’, the United States is in 
peril of losing its global competitive edge 
unless we make substantial investments in 
science, math, research, and innovation; 
Whereas breakthroughs in scientific research 
are the building blocks of a productive, 
competitive, and healthy society; 
Whereas the Nobel Prize is a prestigious 
international award administered annually 
by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden, 
and has since 1901 recognized the world’s 
most outstanding achievements in physics, 
chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, 
and peace; 
Whereas on December 10, 2006, in Stockholm, 
Sweden, the following five American 
scientists were awarded the three Nobel 
Prizes for science. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 
was awarded to Roger D. Kornberg from 
Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, 
for his studies of the molecular basis of 
eukaryotic transcription. The Nobel Prize in 
Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Andrew 
Fire from the Stanford University 
School of Medicine in Palo Alto, California, 
and Craig Mello from the University of Massachusetts 
Medical School in Worcester, 
Massachusetts, for their discovery of RNA 
interference through gene silencing by double-
stranded RNA. The Nobel Prize in Physics 
was awarded to John C. Mather from the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, 
Maryland, and the University of Maryland 
and George F. Smoot, a National 
Science Foundation grantee from the University 
of California at Berkeley for their 
discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy 
of the cosmic microwave background 
radiation; 
Whereas American scientists have not 
swept the Nobel Prize science awards since 
1983; 
Whereas Roger D. Kornberg, Andrew Fire, 
Craig Mello, John C. Mather, and George F. 
Smoot have represented the United States 
and have served as unofficial ambassadors of 
science overseas; and 
Whereas the accomplishments of these scientists 
are significant achievements in the 
field of scientific research and further promote 
the United States among the world 
leaders in science: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 


(1) recognizes Roger D. Kornberg, Andrew 
Fire, Craig Mello, John C. Mather, and 
George F. Smoot for advancing scientific discovery 
and dedicating their careers to scientific 
research; 
(2) recognizes the National Science Foundation 
and the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration for their support of 
the physics Nobel Prize winners; and 
(3) congratulates the achievement of Roger 
D. Kornberg, Andrew Fire, Craig Mello, John 
C. Mather, and George F. Smoot for being 
awarded Nobel Prizes in science. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCNERNEY) and the 
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH) 
each will control 20 minutes. 

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to in


clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
316, the resolution now under consideration. 


The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from California? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 

Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank Chairman GORDON and Ranking 
Member HALL for their support of this 
resolution and working so quickly to 
ensure that we recognize a very deserving 
group of scientists on their important 
achievements. 

b 1300 
The scientists will be honored tomorrow 
at a luncheon here in Washington, 
so the timing of this bill is perfect. I 
appreciate the opportunity to describe 
this legislation that highlights the 
contributions of American scientists. 

H. Res. 316 is significant not only because 
it applauds the breakthroughs of 
scientific work, but the bill also draws 
attention to many issues that we frequently 
work on in the Science and 
Technology Committee, putting a spotlight 
on scientific discovery as a way 
to get young people interested in fields 
they might otherwise ignore. 
For the first time in more than 20 
years, U.S. researchers have swept the 
scientific categories of the Nobel Prize 
by winning the awards for chemistry, 
physiology and medicine, and physics. 
It is fitting that we recognize the contributions 
of these individuals, and I 
am pleased we are doing so here today. 

In December of last year, the Nobel 
Prize in chemistry was awarded to 
Roger Kornberg from Stanford University 
in my home State of California; 
the physiology prize went to Andrew 
Fire, who also works at Stanford in the 
School of Medicine; and the physics 
award went to John Mather from 
NASA’s Goddard Space Center and to 
George Smoot from the University of 
California at Berkeley. Mr. Smoot also 
has the distinction of adding his name 
to the list of more than 170 grantees 
from the National Science Foundation 
who have been granted the Nobel 
Prizes over the years. 

I am sure that with the improvements 
we will be making in the NSF 
program tomorrow and the Congress’ 
dedication to expanding education opportunities, 
Mr. Smoot will certainly 
not be the last recipient of NSF funding 
to receive the Nobel Prize. 

H. Res. 316 officially recognizes the 
accomplishments of these scientists 
and their contributions to improving 
society. 
Madam Speaker, I can’t think of a 
better way to honor these individuals, 
and I commend them for helping the 

U.S. sweep the Nobel Prizes in science 
for the first time in 30 years. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to add my whole-hearted 
thanks and admiration for the skill 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4221 

and effort shown by the five individuals 
we are honoring here today. Since 1901, 
the Nobel Prize has recognized the 
world’s finest minds in the fields of 
physics, chemistry, physiology and 
medicine, literature and peace. In 2006, 
five American scientists were chosen 
for this prestigious award. These five 
men join 763 previous men and women 
and 19 organizations recognized at the 
pinnacle of their fields. 

Roger Kornberg received the Nobel 
Prize in chemistry for his studies on 
transcription, a fundamental cellular 
process that uses information encoded 
in genes to produce proteins. Dr. 
Kornberg’s award comes 47 years after 
his father, Arthur Kornberg, received 
the 1959 Nobel Prize in physiology and 
medicine. In 2006 that prize was awarded 
to Andrew Fire and Craig Mello for 
their influential work on RNA interference, 
a process that uses RNA to 
control the production of proteins. 

John Mather and George Smoot 
share the Nobel Prize in physics for 
their pioneering work in cosmology, 
discovering fluctuations in the cosmic 
microwave background that help explain 
the formation of galaxies, stars, 
and the Earth itself. 

Drs. Roger Kornberg, Andrew Fire, 
Craig Mello, John Mather, and George 
Smoot deserve our thanks and sincere 
appreciation for their efforts supporting 
the greatest innovation economy 
in the world. Without men and 
women like them committed to the 
often arduous task of scientific discovery, 
we would not enjoy the economic 
prosperity that has graced our 
Nation. 

This resolution signals this body’s 
commitment to supporting and 
strengthening the scientific enterprise. 
While this resolution, unfortunately, 
does not match the $10 million prize 
awarded to these Nobel Laureates, we 
can do better by ensuring that we support 
funding for the science and technology 
efforts of the Federal Government. 


Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues 
to support House Resolution 
316. 

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCNERNEY) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, 
H. Res. 316. 

The question was taken; and (two-

Whereas John Glenn served several years 
as a test pilot on Navy and Marine Corps jet 
fighters and attack aircraft; 
Whereas, as a test pilot, John Glenn set a 
transcontinental speed record in 1957 by 
completing the first flight to average supersonic 
speeds from Los Angeles to New York; 
Whereas John Glenn was a pioneer in the 
realm of space exploration and was selected 
in 1959 as one of the original 7 astronauts in 
the United States space program, entering 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s 
(NASA) Project Mercury; 
Whereas John Glenn was assigned to the 
NASA Space Task Group at Langley Research 
Center in Hampton, Virginia; 
Whereas, in 1962, the Space Task Group 
was moved to Houston, Texas, and became 
part of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center; 
Whereas, on February 20, 1962, John Glenn 
piloted the Mercury-Atlas 6 ‘‘Friendship 7’’ 
spacecraft on the first manned orbital mission 
of the United States; 
Whereas, after launching from the Kennedy 
Space Center in Florida, John Glenn 
completed a 3-orbit mission around the planet, 
reaching an approximate maximum altitude 
of 162 statute miles and an approximate 
orbital velocity of 17,500 miles per hour; 
Whereas John Glenn landed Friendship 7 
approximately 5 hours later, 800 miles southeast 
of the Kennedy Space Center near Grand 
Turk Island; 
Whereas, with that pioneering flight, John 
Glenn joined his colleagues Alan Shepard 
and Virgil Grissom in realizing the dream of 
space exploration and engaging the minds 
and imaginations of his and future generations 
in the vast potential of space exploration; 
Whereas, after retiring from the space program, 
John Glenn continued his public service 
as a distinguished member of the Senate, 
in which he served for 24 years; 

Whereas John Glenn has continued his 
public service through his work at the John 
Glenn Institute at Ohio State University, 
which was established to foster public involvement 
in the policy-making process, 
raise public awareness about key policy 
issues, and encourage continuous improvement 
in the management of public enterprise; 


Whereas, in March 1999, Secretary of Education 
Richard W. Riley appointed John

House Resolution 252, recognizing the 
45th anniversary of John Herschel 
Glenn, Jr.’s historic achievement in becoming 
the first United States astronaut 
to orbit the Earth. 

This resolution recognizes John 
Glenn’s distinguished career as a military 
officer in the United States Marine 
Corps, during which he served in 
combat in the South Pacific and the 
Korean conflict and received many 
honors for his military service, as a 
test pilot on Navy and Marine Corps jet 
fighters and attack aircraft, and especially 
as an astronaut on the first 
manned orbital mission of the United 
States. 

Madam Speaker, on February 20, 
1962, John Glenn piloted the Mercury-
Atlas 6 Friendship 7 spacecraft on the 
first U.S. manned orbital space mission, 
completing three orbits of the 


H4222 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

Earth and landing some 5 hours later 
800 miles southeast of Kennedy Space 
Center near Grand Turk Island. With 
that pioneer flight, John Glenn joined 
his fellow Americans, Alan Shepard 
and Virgil Grissom, in realizing the 
dream of space exploration and engaging 
the minds and imaginations of his 
and future generations in the vast potential 
of space exploration. 

This resolution recognizes that John 
Glenn, having retired from the space 
program, continued his public service 
as a distinguished Member of the Senate 
for 24 years and through his work 
at the John Glenn Institute at the Ohio 
State University, which fosters public 
involvement in the policy-making 
process. 

In 1998, John Glenn returned to space 
after 36 years as a member of the crew 
of the Space Shuttle Discovery, helping 
researchers study how weightlessness 
affects the body of an older person. 

Madam Speaker, I urge you and my 
colleagues to support House Resolution 
252, to honor this 45th anniversary of 
John Herschel Glenn, Jr.’s landmark 
mission, piloting the first manned orbital 
mission of the United States, and 
to recognize the profound importance 
of his achievement as a catalyst to 
space exploration and scientific advancement 
in the United States. 

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of 
House Resolution 252, which honors the 
45th anniversary of John Herschel 
Glenn, Jr.’s historic mission as the 
first American to orbit the Earth 
aboard the Mercury spacecraft Friendship 
7. This was truly a landmark event 
in our human space flight program. 
These early successes captured the 
minds and imaginations of people 
around the world and were an inspiration 
to all Americans at a time when 
we were the underdog in a technological 
race with the Soviet Union. 

Prior to his service with NASA, John 
Glenn had already received numerous 
honors for his military service during 
World War II and the Korean War. He 
set a transcontinental speed record in 
1957 by completing the first flight between 
Los Angeles and New York at an 
average speed greater than the speed of 
sound. 

John Glenn was selected as one of the 
original Mercury 7 NASA astronauts in 
1959 and logged over 218 hours in space. 
After retiring from the space program, 
John Glenn continued to serve his 
country as a distinguished Member of 
the United States Senate for 24 years. 
In 1998, John Glenn returned to space 
after 36 years as a member of the crew 
of the Space Shuttle Discovery, serving 
as a subject for basic research into the 
effects of weightlessness on the body of 
an older person. 

John Glenn is truly an American 
hero. I am proud to support this resolution 
honoring such a prominent American 
citizen, military veteran and astronaut. 
I urge my colleagues to support 
H. Res. 252. 

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. SPACE). 

Mr. SPACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H. Res. 252, a resolution 
commemorating the 45th anniversary 
of John Herschel Glenn, Jr.’s 
historic first orbit around the Earth. 

John Glenn’s accomplishments and 
service to his country made him an inspiration 
to a generation of young men 
and women like me. He was a source of 
pride for our Nation. His contributions 
to space exploration helped to change 
our Nation’s way of thinking about the 
new frontier and taught a generation of 
Americans to dream big. I am honored 
that this true American hero was born, 
raised and educated in Ohio’s 18th District. 


Born in 1921 in Cambridge, Ohio, and 
raised in nearby New Concord, John 
Glenn attended New Concord High 
School and earned a bachelor of science 
degree from Muskingum College in 
New Concord. 

John Glenn began his distinguished 
military career by enlisting in the 
Naval Aviation Cadet Program, going 
on to become a Marine pilot, earning 
the Distinguished Flying Cross on six 
occasions and the Air Medal with 18 
clusters. After leaving the military, 
John Glenn became a test pilot for the 
Naval Air Test Center. In 1957 he set a 
speed record by flying from Los Angeles 
to New York in 3 hours 23 minutes. 

While these achievements are without 
question remarkable and cause for 
celebration, Madam Speaker, they are 
not what bring us here today. We are 
here to appreciate John Glenn’s accomplishments 
in a space flight that revolutionized 
how Americans viewed space 
exploration. 

In the 1950s, the concept of sending a 
man into space was foreign to most 
Americans. A mere 50 years after the 
Wright brothers made their first brief 
attempts at manned flight, the prospect 
of propelling a human being into 
outer space was daunting. 

In 1959, John Glenn volunteered to 
become one of the original seven astronauts 
in the Mercury program, the 
first manned space flight program in 
the United States. Several years later, 
John Glenn embarked on his mission. 
In February of 1962, he became the first 
man to orbit the Earth, completing 
that feat three times over. 

Madam Speaker, I understand that 
Senator Glenn knew there was a significant 
chance he would not survive 
the flight. I had the pleasure of a conversation 
with Senator Glenn recently 
where he told me that he chose to go 
on the mission because it was the right 
thing to do, knowing full well he may 
not return. And it was the right thing 
to do not for himself, but for America. 

A year earlier than that, President 
Kennedy announced a bold new mission 
to place a man on the Moon. The success 
of John Glenn’s flight helped bring 
credence and merit to President Kennedy’s 
goal. 

b 1315 

Americans saw that what was once 
impossible was now possible. The possibilities 
suddenly seemed endless. 

Following the end of his career in 
aeronautics, Ohio was the fortunate 
benefactor of John Glenn’s public service 
when he became a United States 
Senator. He served the State with dignity 
and honor for 28 years before retiring. 


Of course, space exploration was 
never far from his heart. After retiring 
from the Senate, he joined the crew of 
the Space Shuttle Discovery and became 
the oldest man to ever venture 
into space. 

Madam Speaker, I have had the privilege 
of meeting this American hero. I 
am struck by his humility and his passion 
for service to his country. Time 
and again, he risked his life for the 
benefit of the American people. He 
prioritized the good of the whole over 
the good of the one, and for that I will 
always admire him. 

As a freshman Member of Congress, I 
often look for examples to follow. For 
me, John Glenn, along with his beautiful 
wife, Annie, represent the absolute 
best this country has to offer. 
They have shown courage in the face of 
adversity and selflessness for the sake 
of making our country better pride. 
They have instilled in all of us the 
hope and inspiration and pride that 
swells the heart and enriches our 
world. 

Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues 
to support this resolution to 
commemorate an achievement that 
was the catalyst for space exploration 

and scientific advancement in the 
United States. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 

Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 

Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. KUCINICH). 

Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for yielding me 
this time. 

I rise in support of this resolution 
honoring the 45th anniversary of John 
Glenn’s historic flight, making him the 
first American to orbit the Earth. 

His journey in the Mercury-Atlas 6 
Friendship 7 spacecraft was made all 
the more incredible by the complications 
that ensued during the flight. 
Scheduled for three orbits, the final 
two had to be piloted on manual control 
after a malfunction in the automatic 
controls. Still on manual control, 
Mr. Glenn piloted the capsule during 
reentry into the earth’s atmosphere. 


The spacecraft also sent a signal to 
the ground that the heat shield, designed 
to prevent the craft from burning 
up on reentry, was loose. Though 
ground control did not tell him, Mr. 
Glenn quickly deduced there was a 
problem. An external piece of the craft 
called a retropack, which was supposed 
to be jettisoned before reentry was left 
on to try to keep the heat shield in 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4223 

place. During the reentry, pieces of 
retropack flew past the capsule’s window 
in flames. Still, Colonel Glenn 
landed safely in the Atlantic Ocean to 
the relief of the Nation. During the 
flight, John Glenn was subjected to 7.7 
Gs and traveled 76,000 miles. 

His success helped lay the groundwork 
for the continuous string of successes 
NASA has since accumulated. 
John Glenn went on to continue his 
lengthy record of public service as a 

U.S. Senator from Ohio, even returning 
to space flight in 1999. 
When we stand here and look back 45 
years, it is almost impossible to imagine 
that a man would step into a small 
container with a huge rocket behind it 
that would propel him into an orbit. 
And when you think of the kind of 
courage that he demonstrated then, 
what is interesting about John Glenn is 
that all of the attention, the fame and 
adulation that came after that didn’t 
affect him one bit. He was basically 
someone who served his country in the 
military, then went on to serve his 
country as a U.S. Senator, and while 
this historic occasion is being recognized, 
I think also we pay tribute to 
John Glenn the man, who has demonstrated 
that it is possible to be able 
to walk with kings and never lose the 
common touch. 

And also, we celebrate his wife, 
Annie, who has been a constant companion 
at Senator Glenn’s side and has 
always represented the finest tradition 
of American couples. John and Annie 
Glenn have so much to be proud of, and 
this Nation owes both of them a debt of 
gratitude, and I am glad to see that we 
are honoring the 45th anniversary of 
his historic flight. Also, I am so 
pleased that so many of my colleagues 
from Ohio are here to join in paying 
tribute to John Glenn. 

Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
REGULA). 

(Mr. REGULA asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. REGULA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for the time. 

Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
John Glenn, a fellow Buckeye, 
on the 45th anniversary of becoming 
the first astronaut to orbit the earth. 

John Glenn is a pioneer in the field of 
space exploration and science, and his 
achievements serve as an inspiration 
for students studying math, engineering, 
science and technology. 

His landmark journey propelled other 
missions and projects such as the first 
moon landing, NASA’S Hubble Space 
Telescope, and the International Space 
Station. Our economic prosperity depends 
increasingly on science and technology, 
and it is because of explorers 
like John Glenn that America remains 
on the cutting edge of science and technology 
research and discovery. 

I would also add that John’s wife, 
Annie, has always been a wonderful, 
supportive partner in the success of 

John’s endeavors. She also deserves our 
appreciation. 

Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. SUTTON). 

Ms. SUTTON. I thank the gentleman 
for the time. 

Madam Speaker, today I join my colleagues 
from Ohio and across the country 
in the celebration of the 45th anniversary 
of John Herschel Glenn Jr.’s 
historic journey around our planet. 

Senator Glenn, a proud Ohio native, 
carried the hopes and dreams of an entire 
country with him on his February 
20, 1962 trip. He carried those dreams in 
the tiny Friendship 7 space capsule, no 
more than 9 feet high and 6 feet wide 
atop the Atlas rocket. He carried those 
dreams into orbit at the astonishing 
speed of 5 miles per second. 

Senator Glenn piloted the Friendship 
7 capsule around the globe three times, 
becoming the first American to orbit 
the earth, an accomplishment that 
raised the spirits of all Americans. 

When speaking about the historic 
journey, Glenn recounted later saying, 
‘‘I don’t know what you can say about 
a day in which you have seen four 
beautiful sunsets, three in orbit and 
one on the surface after I was back on 
board the ship.’’ 

While Glenn was witnessing sunset 
from the window of the space capsule, 
the country was witnessing the sun rising 
on America’s fledgling space program, 
and our Nation’s hunger for 
space exploration. 

I had the tremendous honor of meeting 
Senator Glenn when I was in high 
school. I distinctly remember being in 
awe of his lifetime of accomplishments. 
He has led this country in almost every 
way possible, as a pioneering adventurer, 
as a scientist, as a military hero, 
as an elected leader, and as a champion 
of education. 

Senator Glenn and all of his accomplishments 
are an embodiment of our 
country’s can-do attitude. It is in recognition 
and eternal gratitude that I 
join my colleagues in rising today to 
honor this great man and the 45th anniversary 
of his momentous voyage 
into the great beyond. 

Thank you, Senator Glenn, and may 
your continued journey through life be 
a lesson in adventure and bravery to us 
all. 

Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in proud recognition of the 45th Anniversary 
of Senator John Glenn’s mission piloting 
the first manned orbital mission of the United 
States. This event spawned decades of 
manned space missions for the United States 
and eventually a manned mission to the moon 
with the Apollo 11 mission in July of 1969. 
Senator Glenn has served this Nation proud 
as a Marine Corps Pilot, a U.S. Senator, and 
an Astronaut. He was the third American in 
Space and the first American to orbit the Earth 
aboard Friendship 7. He also holds the honor 
of being the oldest person ever to go into 
space in 1998 aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery 
mission STS–95 at age 77. John Glenn 
was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1974, 
and served the State of Ohio proudly until 

1999, and was a recipient of the Congressional 
Space Medal of Honor. The NASA 
Glenn research center, which is located at 
Lewis Field in Cleveland, OH, adopted Senator 
Glenn’s name in 1999. I am proud to say 
that this institution has produced decades of 
aeronautics research and has become of vital 
part of our community. It is in no small part to 
Senator Glenn that this institution will remain 
a major research center for NASA. 

I am especially proud to be able to say that 
Senator John Glenn comes from my home 
State of Ohio, he is an icon and a role model 
for millions of youths in our State. His accomplishments 
provide inspiration for every young 
person from our Great State of Ohio. 

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H. Res. 252, recognizing the 
45th anniversary of John Glenn and his historic 
1962 orbital flight aboard Friendship 7. 

I commend my colleague, the Honorable 
ZACH SPACE for his efforts on this resolution 
and am honored to be an original cosponsor. 

John Glenn’s orbital flight and his many extraordinary 
achievements in war and peace 
are appropriately enumerated and memorialized 
in this resolution—and it is an amazingly 
long account. Without doubt it is an unsurpassed 
record of accomplishment that includes 
six Distinguished Flying Crosses, the 
Congressional Space Medal of Honor, and the 
only Ohioan to serve four consecutive terms in 
the U.S. Senate. 

At Cape Canaveral on February 20, 1962, 
John Glenn blasted into space and became 
the first American to orbit the Earth. After several 
excruciatingly long launch pad delays, 
people all over the world and every school 
child in America heard Scott Carpenter’s lift off 
directive—Godspeed John Glenn—soon to be 
followed by the cool voice of the pilot: ‘‘Roger. 
Zero Gs and I feel fine. Capsule is turning 
around. Oh, that view is tremendous!’’ 

As he reached an altitude of 162 miles at a 
velocity of 17,500 miles an hour, the excitement 
quickly turned to tension and apprehension 
when the flight instruments indicated that 
a loose heat shield threatened a safe return. 
While the capsule skated back through the atmosphere, 
Friendship 7 reported a real fireball 
outside. To our great relief the plume of parachutes 
and splashdown told us that after a 
nearly 5 hour flight, Glenn was safe and 
sound back on Earth. 

On February 26, 1962, John Glenn was received 
with a standing ovation before a Joint 
Session of Congress in this chamber. Parades 
in Washington, New York, and New Concord, 
Ohio, soon followed. Friendship 7 is now 
prominently displayed in the Smithsonian’s Air 
and Space Museum near Orville and Wilbur 
Wright’s 1903 Flyer, Charles Lindbergh’s Spirit 
of St. Louis and Apollo XI. 

John and Annie Glenn celebrated their 64th 
wedding anniversary on April 6th. Annie is a 
true American hero for her extraordinary personal 
efforts to overcome stuttering. Her public 
efforts to help others with speech and communication 
disorders are nationally recognized. 
She received the first national award of the 
American Speech and Hearing Association for 
inspiring those with communicative disorders. 
The National Association for Hearing and 
Speech Action annually presents the Annie 
Glenn Award to an individual achieving distinction 
despite a communication disorder. She is 
a national treasure. 

In 1941, John Glenn was on his way to 
Annie’s organ recital at Muskingum College 


H4224 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

when he heard over the car radio that Pearl 
Harbor had been attacked. His patriotic public 
service began shortly thereafter when he volunteered 
for military service and continues 
today through his work at the John Glenn 
School of Public Affairs at the Ohio State University. 


In a lifetime of accomplishment he found in 
adventure and challenge he met with courage. 
John Glenn is an American hero. He has 
proudly served his Nation as soldier and 
statesman and he still likes to fly. 

I join my colleagues in urging the passage 
of the resolution. 

Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commend our able colleague, Congressman 
ZACK SPACE of Ohio for recognition of our beloved 
former Ohio Senator John Glenn, who 
began his distinguished career as a World 
War II and Korean War fighter pilot. Glenn 
was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross 
six times and holds the Air Medal for his service 
during both of these conflicts. 

As the beginning in a long line of firsts, Senator 
and Colonel Glenn went on to set a transcontinental 
speed record from Los Angeles to 
New York in July 1957. In February 1962, 
Glenn piloted the Mercury-Atlas 6 Friendship 7 
spacecraft on the first manned orbital mission 
of the United States. After his distinguished 
service in these two wars and following the 
first phase of his career as an aviator, John 
Glenn continued his public service as a Senator 
representing our home State of Ohio from 
1974–1999. 

Completing his career of firsts, I was proud 
to see our former colleague Senator Glenn 
bring his career of public service full circle in 
his triumphant 1998 return space voyage; this 
time as a senior citizen. Today I rise to honor 
his hard work and lifetime of dedication to 
public service. He and his devoted wife have 
inspired all the world with their commitment to 
family, community, state, nation and the future. 
Their spirit of patriotism, courage, discovery 
and self sacrifice cut a path all can 
emulate and hope to achieve. Godspeed to 
them for all they have done for others. 

Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 

Mr. WILSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WILSON) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
agree to the resolution, H. Res. 252. 

The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolution 
was agreed to. 

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I request 5 legislative 
days during which Members may insert 
materials relevant to H. Res. 334 into 
the RECORD. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentlewoman 
from New York? 

There was no objection. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 

(Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York asked 
and was given permission to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank 

my colleague from North Carolina (Mr. 
MILLER) for introducing this resolution 
and for the work he has done. 

This month is recognized as National 
Community College Month. Community 
colleges represent much of what is 
great about America. Diverse, dynamic 
and innovative, open and inclusive, 
they are one of America’s greatest inventions. 


The first community college, Joliet 
Junior College, opened its doors almost 
100 years ago in Illinois. It was one of 
the many that sprung up in the early 
20th century amid worries that America 
could not remain competitive without 
a better educated workforce. 

Policymakers and educators sensed 
that one of the barriers keeping students 
from keeping their education was 
that they were unable or unwilling to 
leave home. And so a network of community 
colleges was set up to encourage 
more students to earn college degrees 
or obtain specialized training. 
Today, over 11 million students are enrolled 
in America’s 1,200 community 
colleges. 

Community colleges educate over 
half of the country’s undergraduate 
students. Community college open enrollment 
policies mean that they welcome 
all students regardless of wealth, 
heritage, or previous academic experience. 
As a result, community colleges 
are more diverse in terms of age, income, 
race and ethnicity than traditional 
colleges and universities. They 
enroll students from all over the world. 

About 40 percent of all international 
undergraduates in the United States 
attend our community colleges. By 
bringing people from all walks of life 
together to learn from one another, 
these schools enrich and enhance our 
communities. 

Community colleges educate over 
half of the new nurses and 65 percent of 
new health care workers. They are also 
responsible for the education of 50 percent 
of teachers and close to 85 percent 
of our emergency responders. 

Community colleges retrain workers 
who have lost their jobs, those looking 
to change fields mid-career or reenter 
the workforce after an extended absence, 
and high school students hoping 
to get a head start on college credit or 
take a course not offered in the regular 
curriculum. 

Because of all that they have done 
for this country, on this day we would 
like to thank our Nation’s community 
colleges and recognize the dedication 
of their facilities and staff for helping 
to educate our Nation’s students. 

I urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution. 

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, 
yield myself such time as I may consume. 


I rise in strong support of this resolution 
to support the goals and ideals of 
National Community College Month. 

Community colleges are centers of 
educational opportunity. For over 100 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4225 

years, they have been inclusive institutions 
that welcome all who desire to 
learn, regardless of wealth, heritage or 
previous academic experience. 

b 1330 
Since their creation, community colleges 
have grown tremendously in 
numbers and have changed with the 
times. According to the American Association 
of Community Colleges, there 
are over 1,000 community colleges in 
this country serving about 11 million 
students. No other segment of higher 
education is more responsive to its 
community and workforce needs than 
the community college. 
The community colleges help provide 
the country with professionals in fields 
like computer technology, law enforcement, 
homeland security, nursing and 
other health care fields. About 50 percent 
of new nurses are educated at 
community colleges, and close to 80 
percent of firefighters, law enforcement 
officers, and emergency medicine 
technicians received their credentials 
from community colleges. 
Not only do community colleges 
serve a unique role in graduating students 
with specific skills, but they are 
also extremely affordable. Tuition and 
fees at public community colleges average 
less than half of those at public 
4-year colleges and one-tenth the tuition 
and fees at independent 4-year colleges. 
In my congressional district, the 
Harrisburg Area Community College is 
a shining example of the important and 
successful role of community colleges 
in our Nation’s higher education system. 
In fact, I am fortunate to have 
two branches of the Harrisburg Area 
Community College in my congressional 
district, in York and Gettysburg. 
Graduates from HACC begin careers 
in fields currently experiencing 
shortages such as nursing, early childhood 
education, and law enforcement. I 
have seen firsthand the successful partnerships 
created between the community 
college and local businesses. 
We hope to continue to build on the 
support being given to community colleges 
through the reauthorization of 
the Higher Education Act. The reauthorization 
is an opportunity to look 
at every program individually and determine 
if it is helping us meet our 
goal of providng a quality and affordable 
post-secondary education to every 
American. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution honoring the goals and 
ideals of National Community College 
Month. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 
3 minutes to my colleague, the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. WU). 
Mr. WU. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman from New York. 
As cochair of the House Community 
College Caucus, I rise in strong support 
of H. Res. 334, a bill that recognizes the 

goals and ideals of National Community 
College Month; and I thank Congressman 
BRAD MILLER, the gentleman 
from North Carolina, for his leadership 
and for introducing this legislation. 

Almost 50 percent of undergraduate 
students are enrolled in community 
colleges. It is the tradition of community 
colleges to serve nontraditional 
students. Many students work either 
part-time or full-time while they take 
classes. Others are seeking job training 
to allow them to better support their 
families. Some are returning to the 
workplace after a few years, and some 
are single parents. Increasingly, many 
are high school students who attend 
community college before a 4-year institution. 
This saves them, and frequently 
taxpayers, tuition, fees and financial 
aid dollars. In other words, we 
have no sector of education that serves 
a wider spectrum of our citizens every 
day. 

As we look to what this new century 
holds for us, we know that employers 
seek people who not only are well 
versed in science and technology concepts 
but are also adept at learning 
through experimentation, inquiry, critical 
examination, and discovery. In 
other words, employers are seeking a 
highly trainable workforce, rather 
than just a highly trained workforce. 

Community colleges are at the forefront 
of this effort. They are a cornerstone 
of our system of undergraduate 
education, particularly in mathematics 
and the sciences. As we all know, these 
areas of study are ever more critical 
for our Nation and our State to maintain 
an economic edge in the global 
economy. 

I strongly support this resolution and 
urge my colleagues to do so as well. 

Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 8 minutes to 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. MILLER), the sponsor of this resolution. 


Mr. MILLER of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today as the 
sponsor of this resolution to support 
and celebrate the ideals of National 
Community College Month. 

I am very proud to offer this resolution 
as one of the cochairs of the House 
Community College Caucus, and I am 
pleased to be joined with three cosponsors, 
the other three Chairs of that 
caucus, Mr. WU of Oregon, who just 
spoke, Mr. CASTLE of Delaware and Mr. 
WICKER of Mississippi. I would also like 
to thank Chairman GEORGE MILLER and 
Ranking Member MCKEON of the Education 
and Labor Committee, both of 
whom are also original cosponsors of 
this resolution, and without whose support 
this measure would not be before 
us today. 

Madam Speaker, there are now 11 
million Americans enrolled in more 
than 1,200 community colleges across 
the country; and in the past century 
since the first community college 
opened its doors, more than 100 million 

Americans have taken courses at community 
colleges. Community colleges 
have developed a tradition and a purpose 
that is distinct from that of traditional 
4-year colleges and universities. 

Community colleges are distinct 
from 4-year colleges in many respects. 
They are regionally accredited, post-
secondary schools. The highest credential 
awarded by a community college is 
that of an associate degree. In fact, 
Madam Speaker, many Americans who 
did not get a high school diploma go 
back to community colleges to get 
their GED. 

The community college system in my 
State, and in most States, offers a 
comprehensive curriculum, including 
transfer, technical and continuing education 
programs. The community college 
system in North Carolina has 58 
separate community-based institutions 
that collectively offer more than 2,200 
curriculum programs. 

Beyond that curriculum, Madam 
Speaker, what most distinguishes community 
colleges from 4-year colleges is 
their accessibility or affordability, 
their location, their diversity and how 
intensely relevant the training and the 
education community colleges provide 
for the ability of working Americans to 
improve their job skills, particularly in 
a changing economy as we go through 
a painful economic transition, certainly 
in my State but also in the entire 
country. 

The distinctions between community 
colleges and 4-year colleges are fundamental 
to the core mission and success 
of America’s community colleges; and 
with the month of April, we have the 
chance to celebrate those distinctions 
and recognize Community College 
Month. 

Community colleges are frequently 
referred to as ‘‘the people’s colleges’’ 
because they have open-door admission 
policies; and while that is true, they 
are accurately described as people’s 
colleges for many reasons. 

Madam Speaker, students that attend 
community colleges are more diverse 
than those enrolled in any other 
kind of college or university. Of the 

11.6 million students enrolled in community 
colleges across the country 
today, more than one-third are members 
of racial or ethnic minority 
groups, and roughly 60 percent are 
women. Of the more than 5 million or 
so students who are enrolled full-time 
at community colleges, 76 percent, or 
more than three-quarters, are working; 
and about one-third are working full-
time while carrying a full-time community 
college course load. There is an 
equal number or greater number of 
community college students who are 
going to community colleges attending 
community colleges part-time also 
while working full-time and fulfilling 
the responsibilities of their family and 
of their home. 
Community colleges are affordable. 
The average annual tuition at a community 
college is only about half that 


H4226 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

of a 4-year public. In addition, community 
colleges are close to home and students 
can stay at home, live at home. 
They do live at home so they save 
money on room, board, transportation, 
all the other expenses associated with 
community colleges. 

Students at community colleges mirror 
the communities that support 
them, and that is nowhere more evident 
than in the age of the students. 
The average age of a community college 
student is almost 30. More than 57 
percent of those enrolled in community 
colleges are older than 22, the traditional 
age that students graduate from 
college, and more than 16 percent are 
past the age of 40. In North Carolina, 
there are 368,000 students between the 
ages of 25 and 50 enrolled in community 
colleges. 

Community college curricula are intensely 
relevant to the needs of American 
business and to the needs of American 
workers in having the skills that 
they need to support themselves and 
support their families, whether it is 
construction trades, the skills needed 
to do construction trades or computer 
programs, computer spreadsheet, all 
the different computer programs that 
any American officer worker is going 
to need, and frequently when they need 
to learn a new one, they can go part-
time to a community college nearby 
and learn the skills they need for their 
job. 

In North Carolina, almost every community 
college has a curriculum that 
is specifically geared, designed for an 
industry, a major employer in that 
area. When I was first elected to Congress, 
I visited the extrusion campus of 
Wake Technical College. Extrusion is a 
process by which plastic is pulled like 
taffy. In just the 5 years or 41/2 years I 
have been in Congress, that technology 
has lost jobs. In just the 41/2 years I 
have been in Congress, extrusion technologies 
have taken a hit. 

We have lost jobs; but at that same 
community college, they now have a 
program in computer gaming. Americans 
will spend more on computer gaming 
this year than they will spend on 
movie box offices. Computer gaming is 
becoming more and more important in 
providing educational opportunities in 
a format that most Americans, younger 
Americans, are very familiar with. 
That industry is developing around 
Wiley. The community college curriculum 
is going to be part of what attracts 
new gaming companies to that 
area as well as supporting the ones 
that are there now. 

So community colleges through open 
admission, affordability, community-
based training are playing an amazingly 
important role in the American 
economy and have to do even more so. 

I have asked two chairmen of the 
Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan 
and Ben Bernanke, about how we can 
close the income inequality of Americans; 
and both of them have mentioned 
specifically community colleges in the 
role they need to play in providing 

Americans the skills that they need to 
demand better wages, to be able to get 
better wages in the American economy 
and in the world economy. 

Despite that importance, in the 41/2 
years I have been here, it has been a 
fight to get support for community colleges; 
and it has been 25 years since we 
have even had a resolution like this on 
the floor of Congress honoring the role 
of community colleges. It was 1985 during 
the 99th Congress that this Congress 
specifically recognized and honored 
community colleges. 

So I am pleased to be here, and I urge 
all to be here in support of this resolution, 
and I encourage all of my colleagues 
to join me today. 

Mr. PLATTS. Does the gentlewoman 
have other speakers? 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. We 
have one more speaker. 

Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time 
then. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. HARE). 

Mr. HARE. I thank the gentlewoman 
for yielding. 

Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H. Res. 334, honoring the goals 
and ideals of National Community College 
Month. I am proud to have the opportunity 
today to acknowledge all the 
community colleges in my district, and 
I want to thank them for the invaluable 
contributions that they make to 
education, to the communities that I 
serve, to our State and to our Nation in 
general. 

Community colleges offer affordable 
opportunities for students of all ages to 
receive a higher education, retraining 
for new jobs and other university preparation 
courses. In my district alone, 
our community colleges work directly 
with workforce development one-stop 
centers, providing critical computer 
literacy courses, technical training and 
basic education that are needed for 
newly emerging jobs. In particular, 
Richland Community College in Macon 
County in my district is in the process 
of pioneering a course to prepare workers 
for the biofuels sector that is 
quickly becoming a major industry in 
my home State of Illinois. 

b 1345 
As factories and other companies 
leave to go overseas, or as new industries 
emerge, creating new jobs that require 
unique skills, community colleges 
become increasingly important to 
educate, train and equip the new workforce 
that will fill these jobs. Additionally, 
they cannot allow students who 
cannot afford to go to a 4-year university, 
but who have the ambition and 
talent to succeed at one, the opportunity 
to complete the first 2 years of 
courses at affordable prices, and then 
allow those students to transfer to 
larger schools. 
For these reasons and many more, I 
am happy to stand today to honor 

Community College Month. As a member 
of the Community College Caucus, 
I am working hard with my other colleagues 
to make sure community colleges 
have the resources and funding 
they need to continue to offer the services 
that are so critical to all of our 
communities across our country. 

I urge my colleagues to join me in 
celebrating Community College Month 
by passing H. Res. 334. 

Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, 
again urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote and want to 
commend the sponsor, Mr. MILLER, and 
others supporting this, and my chairwoman, 
Mrs. MCCARTHY, for her advocacy 
here on floor. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 

Mr. HINOJOSA. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H. Res. 334. 

Community colleges are the institutions that 
make things happen for our communities. 
They are the gateway to higher education for 
most of our students. They provide the opportunities 
that give lifelong learning real meaning. 
They are central to workforce development. 


In short, they are the rapid response system, 
the innovators, and the engine for economic 
development for communities across 
the Nation. 

I know first hand what a difference a community 
college can make. it was my great 
privilege to be the founding chair of South 
Texas College. When I was first elected to 
Congress in 1996, the unemployment rate in 
my district topped 22 percent. 

In 1996, South Texas College was a couple 
of years old and just beginning to build from 
its initial enrollment of 800 students. Today, 
our unemployment rate is less than 6 percent, 
and South Texas College is enrolling over 
18,000 students each year. That is the difference 
a community college can make. 

Community colleges have also stepped up 
to offer new and exciting opportunities for students 
while they are still in high school. Community 
colleges are on the cutting edge of 
high school reform. 

For example, in my district, Texas State 
Technical College in Harlingen is hosting a 
new Early College High School that will enroll 
its first class of 100 freshmen this fall. Students 
graduating from this new school will 
have a head start in college, earning a possible 
60 credit hours along with their distinguished 
achievement high school diplomas. 

In our rural communities community colleges 
are critical pieces of the economic infrastructure. 


Consider the results of an economic impact 
study that found that the instruction provided 
by Coastal Bend College, in Beeville, Texas 
resulted in an accumulated contribution of 
$48.5 million in annual earnings to the Rural 
Coastal Bend Economy. That is roughly the 
equivalent of 2,087 jobs, which is a significant 
number in our rural economies. 

I would like to thank my colleague from 
North Carolina, Congressman MILLER, for 
bringing this resolution forward. 

I wholeheartedly join him in supporting the 
goals and ideals of National Community College 
month. I urge my colleagues to support 
H. Res 334. 

Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
Bucks County Community College in celebration 
of National Community College Month. By 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4227 

providing a gateway to higher learning for 
those who would otherwise be unable to continue 
their education, community colleges, like 
Bucks County, are improving our society and 
our communities. We need to continue to work 
to make college more accessible, so that we 
continue to build a more competitive workforce. 
Madam Speaker, by supporting these 
important institutions of higher education we 
can ensure their ability to serve students 
eager for knowledge and a path to a successful 
future. 

Madam Speaker, I am a strong advocate of 
community colleges because I am the product 
of a community college. After graduating from 
high school, I enrolled at Bucks County Community 
College, in Newtown, Pennsylvania, 
where I gained the ability and confidence to 
achieve. My year at Bucks County Community 
College was very important. It prepared me for 
King’s College, Widener University School of 
Law and eventually to serve as an educator 
myself at West Point. My love of learning and 
teaching blossomed at Bucks County Community 
College—an experience no doubt shared 
by so many across our great Nation. 

For more than 40 years, Bucks County 
Community College has provided a critical 
service to Bucks County. Whether students 
are there as a stepping stone to another college 
or university, or preparing for jobs in business, 
public service or health care, Bucks provides 
a high quality education and a great environment 
in which to learn. The college has 
expanded its services by opening two campuses 
in addition to its main campus in New-
town. This has increased accessibility, especially 
for those continuing their education while 
working full-time. As one of the oldest community 
colleges in Pennsylvania, Bucks County 
Community College has established itself as a 
leader in education, not just among other community 
colleges, but among all colleges and 
universities. 

If not for Bucks County Community College, 
I would not be where I am today. I know that 
mine is not the only case in which a community 
college changed the life of a young student. 
With 11 million students enrolled at more 
than 1,200 community colleges nationwide, 
these schools provide an invaluable service to 
a large portion of our community. Madam 
Speaker, these affordable, local institutions 
give every student, of every background, the 
ability to experience the benefits of higher 
education. 

It was at Bucks County Community College 
that I learned how hard I could work and how 
much I could achieve. Like millions of other 
students, all I needed was an opportunity, and 
I took advantage of it. Madam Speaker, this is 
the unique and necessary function of our community 
colleges. They give every student a 
chance to succeed. 

Madam Speaker, my appreciation for the 
opportunity provided by our community colleges 
is personal and near to my heart. I Urge 
my colleagues to join me in supporting H. 
Res. 334. 

Mr. WICKER. Madam Speaker, I rise in support 
of this resolution celebrating National 
Community College Month. 

For more than a century, community colleges 
have offered millions of Americans an 
affordable means of education close to home. 
Today 11 million students are enrolled in 
these institutions, and the reach of this educational 
opportunity goes far beyond serving 

the traditional high school graduate. Many 
adults are taking classes to pursue a college 
degree, gain continuing education for their 
present jobs, learn skills for new careers, and 
earn high school diplomas. 

Community colleges are also playing key 
leadership roles today in support of economic 
development activities. The unique ability of 
these institutions to adapt workforce training 
programs to meet specific needs in the areas 
they serve is a powerful resource. These 
schools have been partners in attracting new 
industry and helping existing businesses expand 
operations. 

As co-chair of the bipartisan Community 
College Caucus, I am proud to join this effort 
to support the goals of National Community 
College Month and congratulate these institutions, 
their students, faculty, and staff for their 
contributions to education. 

Our caucus was created in 2006 to help 
educate Members of Congress and focus national 
attention on the activities community colleges 
are undertaking to provide educational 
options and improve the quality of life in the 
areas they serve. 

I am also proud of the role the State of Mississippi 
has played in the development of this 
important educational opportunity. In 1922, 
Mississippi became the first State to create a 
statewide system of junior colleges. It brought 
affordable and accessible post-secondary educational 
choices to all of our citizens. Today, 
more than 70,000 full-time students are enrolled 
at 15 community colleges in my home 
State. 

I stand in strong support of our community 
colleges and salute their work to educate a diverse 
group of Americans spanning all age, income, 
race, and ethnic categories. The enhanced 
opportunities provided by these institutions 
are educating millions of people and 
helping provide a more skilled workforce to 
compete in our global economy. 

Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, on that I demand the 
yeas and nays. 

The yeas and nays were ordered.

SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND 

IDEAS OF A NATIONAL CHILD 

CARE WORTHY WAGE DAY 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the 
rules and agree to the concurrent resolution 
(H. Con. Res. 112) supporting the 
goals and ideas of a National Child 
Care Worthy Wage Day. 

The Clerk read the title of the concurrent 
resolution. 

The text of the concurrent resolution 
is as follows: 

H. CON. RES. 112 
Whereas approximately 63 percent of the 
Nation’s children under 5 are in nonparental 
care during part or all of the day while their 
parents work; 
Whereas the early care and education industry 
employs more than 2,300,000 workers; 
Whereas the average salary of early care 
and education workers is $18,180 per year, 
and only 1/3 have health insurance and even 
fewer have a pension plan; 
Whereas the quality of early care and education 
programs is directly linked to the 
quality of early childhood educators; 
Whereas the turnover rate of early childhood 
program staff is roughly 30 percent per 
year, and low wages and lack of benefits, 
among other factors, make it difficult to retain 
high quality educators who have the 
consistent, caring relationships with young 
children that are important to children’s development; 
Whereas the compensation of early childhood 
program staff should be commensurate 
with the importance of the job of helping the 
young children of the Nation develop their 
social, emotional, physical, and cognitive 
skills, and to help them be ready for school; 
Whereas providing adequate compensation 
to early childhood program staff should be a 
priority, and resources may be allocated to 
improve the compensation of early childhood 
educators to ensure that quality care and 
education are accessible for all families; 
Whereas additional training and education 
for the early care and education workforce is 
critical to ensuring high-quality early learning 
environments; 
Whereas child care workers should receive 
compensation commensurate with such 
training and experience; and 
Whereas the Center for the Child Care 
Workforce, a project of the American Federation 
of Teachers Educational Foundation, 
with support by the National Association for 
the Education of Young Children and other 
early childhood organizations, recognizes 
May 1 as National Child Care Worthy Wage 
Day: Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved by the House of Representatives (the 
Senate concurring), That the Congress supports 
the goals and ideas of National Child 
Care Worthy Wage Day, and urges public officials 
and the general public to honor early 
childhood care and education staff and programs 
in their communities and to work together 
to resolve the early childhood care 
and education staff compensation crisis. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. MCCARTHY) and the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
PLATTS) each will control 20 minutes. 

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman 
from New York. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I request 5 legislative 
days during which Members may insert 
material relevant to H. Con. Res. 112 
into the RECORD. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentlewoman 
from New York? 

There was no objection. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself as 
much time as I may consume.

and was given permission to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 


H4228 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, on May 1 of each year, 
child care providers and other early 
childhood professionals nationwide 
conduct awareness and education efforts 
highlighting the importance of 
good early childhood education for our 
Nation’s young children. 

In support of these actions, I have introduced 
H. Con. Res. 112, a bipartisan 
resolution in support of National Child 
Care Worthy Wage Day. This resolution 
is an effort to support these initiatives 
and to help develop greater public 
awareness in this area. Every day, approximately 
13 million children are 
cared for outside the home so that 
their parents can work, including some 
who work in our congressional offices. 

The committed individuals who nurture 
and teach these young children 
are undervalued, despite their important 
work. We know that children 
begin to learn at birth, and that the 
quality of care they receive will affect 
their language, development, math 
skills, behavior and general readiness 
for school. However, the inadequate 
level of wages for child care staff, 
roughly $18,000 a year, has led to difficulties 
in attracting and retaining 
high quality early childhood caretakers 
and educators. 

In addition to low wages, less than 
one-third of child care workers have 
health insurance, and even fewer have 
pensions. As a result, the turnover rate 
for child care providers is 30 percent a 
year. This high turnover rate interrupts 
consistent and stable relations 
that children need to have with their 
caregivers. 

Please join me in recognizing the important 
work of child care providers 
and support the efforts to provide them 
with a worthy wage. The Nation’s child 
care workforce and the families that 
depend on them deserve our support. 

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of House Concurrent Resolution 
112, supporting the goals and ideas of a 
National Child Care Worthy Wage Day. 
I would like to thank my colleague 
from New York (Mrs. MCCARTHY) for 
her leadership on this issue and for introducing 
the resolution we are considering 
here today. 

Child care is an integral part of the 
daily routine of millions of families 
with young children. Working parents 
depend on child care so they can earn 
the income needed to support their 
families, as well as ensure that their 
children are well cared for in safe environments 
while they are working. As a 
result, approximately 63 percent of 
children under 5 years of age are in 
some type of regular child care environment 
each week. 

High-quality child care, care that 
provides a stable, safe, stimulating environment, 
helps children enter school 
prepared to learn. Research has repeat


edly shown that children who receive 
high-quality child care demonstrate 
greater mathematical ability, greater 
attention and thinking skills and fewer 
behavioral problems than children who 
receive low-quality care. 

Quality care is directly linked to the 
quality of the educators, helping children 
to grow, learn and gain new skills 
is rewarding. However, it’s very physically 
and emotionally taxing, as educators 
work long days, must be constantly 
alert, deal effectively with disruptive 
children, anticipate and prevent 
trouble, and provide firm but fair 
discipline. As a result, many child care 
workers leave the profession. The turnover 
rate in this industry is roughly 30 
percent per year. 

Compensation and additional training 
are important variables to ensure a 
high quality child care environment for 
our children. We need to attract and 
retain educators who have the caring, 
consistent relationships that are critical 
to children’s development. I am 
pleased to commend our Nation’s child 
care providers for their dedicated service 
to our Nation’s children and their 
families. 

I think it’s important that we are 
taking time to recognize the critically 
important work of child care providers 
and the importance of doing better 
when it comes to their pay and benefits. 


As a parent myself, my children, now 
second grade, fourth graders, went 
through a preschool program that was 
exceptional, it was certified. In that facility, 
we had both the preschool program 
and a very high-quality child 
care center as well. We saw the benefits 
to our children personally of that professional 
setting. An important part of 
being able to retain professional workers, 
staff, in those settings, is the pay 
and benefits. 

When we look at the quality of these 
facilities, if we don’t reduce that turnover 
rate, that 30 percent turnover 
rate, we will continue to be challenged 
to get somebody new in and get them 
up to speed. That impacts the quality 
of the care provided. 

So I, again, commend the sponsor of 
the resolution for helping to raise national 
recognition and the importance 
of this issue, and urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 


I want to thank the ranking member, 
Mr. PLATTS from Pennsylvania. Working 
with him on the committee has certainly 
been a joy. We do work very well 
together. 

As the gentleman has said, passing H. 
Con. Res. 112 is extremely important. I 
stand by the words that my colleague 
has spoken. But I think that this Nation 
really has to start looking at how 
we prepare, certainly for the few future 
and for the global economy that we are 
all facing. Certainly having high-qualified 
teachers, day care workers to 

make sure that our children are getting 
the best education they possibly 
can at the earliest age possible. We 
look at the other countries and see 
what they are doing. I have to say that 
many times we are shortchanging our 
children. 

Madam Speaker, I am asking that 
our Members vote for H. Con. Res. 112. 

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
MCCARTHY) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, 
H. Con. Res. 112. 

The question was taken. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, on that I demand the 
yeas and nays. 

The yeas and nays were ordered. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to clause 8 of rule XX and the 
Chair’s prior announcement, further 
proceedings on this question will be 
postponed.

COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF 
FLORIDA GATORS FOR THEIR 
HISTORIC WIN IN THE 2007 NCAA 
MEN’S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT 


Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution (H. 
Res. 298) to commend the University of 
Florida Gators for their historic win in 
the 2007 National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Division I Men’s Basketball 
Tournament. 

The Clerk read the title of the resolution. 
The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. RES. 298 
Whereas, on April 2, 2007, the University of 
Florida Gators defeated the Ohio State 
Buckeyes 84–75 in the final game of the 
NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament 
in Atlanta, Georgia; 
Whereas the Gators’ became the first team 
since 1991–92 to win back-to-back national titles 
and just the 7th school ever to be repeat 
champions; 
Whereas the Gators became the first team 
ever to repeat as champions with the same 
starting lineup; 
Whereas Florida’s overall athletic program 
has proven to be one of the best in the Nation, 
now having won 21 national champions 
in all sports combined; 
Whereas the University of Florida remains 
the only program to hold both football and 
men’s basketball championships at the same 
time and the first school in NCAA history to 
hold both the basketball and football championship 
titles in the same calendar year; 
Whereas the Gators’ head basketball coach 
Billy Donovan became the 12th coach to win 
multiple men’s basketball championships 
and one of four active coaches to win multiple 
titles; 
Whereas Donovan became the third youngest 
coach to win more than one NCAA title; 
Whereas the Gators finished their season 
with an impressive record of 35–5, including 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4229 

winning the final 10 games of the season, and 
have an 18-game win streak in the post-season, 
including sweeps at the Southeastern 
Conference tournaments the last two years 
and 12–0 in the NCAA Tournament; 

Whereas the Gators contributed Corey 
Brewer, Al Horford, and Lee Humphrey to 
the All Tournament Team, joining Greg 
Oden and Mike Conley, Jr., of Ohio State; 

Whereas each player, coach, trainer, manager, 
and staff member of the University of 
Florida Gators dedicated this season and 
their efforts to the common goal of repeating 
as NCAA men’s basketball champions; 

Whereas the Gators’ players, coaches, and 
everyone associated with the men’s basketball 
team represent the University and the 
State of Florida with exemplary sportsmanship

Whereas residents of Florida and Gator 
fans worldwide are to be commended for 
their longstanding support, perseverance,

New York (Mrs. MCCARTHY) and the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
PLATTS) each will control 20 minutes. 

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman 
from New York. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I request 5 legislative 
days during which Members may insert 
material relevant to H. Res. 298 into 
the RECORD. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentlewoman 
from New York? 

There was no objection. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 

(Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York asked 
and was given permission to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank 
Congressman STEARNS for introducing 
this resolution. I rise in support of 
House Resolution 298, a bill to commend 
the University of Florida Gators 
for their historical win in the 2007 
NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball 
Tournament. 

On April 22 the Florida Gators defeated 
the Ohio State Buckeyes 84–75 in 
the final game of the Division I Men’s 
Basketball Tournament in Atlanta, 
Georgia. The Gators became the first 
team since 1992 to win back-to-back national 
titles and just the seventh 
school ever to be repeat champions. 

They were also the first team in history 
to complete this feat with the 
same starting lineup. The University of 
Florida’s athletic program has proven 

to be one of the best in the Nation, now 
having won 21 national championships 
in all sports combined. They are the 
only program to hold both football and 
men’s basketball championships at the 
same time, and the first school in 
NCAA history to hold both the basketball 
and football championship titles in 
the same calendar year. 

The Gators’ basketball team was led 
by their great coach, Billy Donovan, 
who became the 12th coach to win multiple 
basketball championships and one 
of four active coaches to win multiple 
titles. On top of that, Donovan became 
the third youngest coach to win more 
than one NCAA title. Coach Donovan is 
also a native of the Fourth Congressional 
District, originally hailing from 
Rockville Centre, in my district on 
Long Island. 

The Gators finished their season with 
an impressive record of 35–5, winning 
the final 10 games of the season. Every 
player, coach, trainer, manager and 
staff member of the University of Florida 
Gators dedicated this season and 
their efforts to the common goal of repeating 
as men’s NCAA basketball 
champions, and did so with class and 
sportsmanship. 

I urge my colleagues to show their 
support for the Florida Gators and vote 
for House Resolution 298. 

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the distinguished gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. STEARNS) as much time as 
he may consume. 

(Mr. STEARNS asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. STEARNS. Let me thank, first of 
all, my colleagues, for bringing this 
resolution to the floor. I certainly appreciate 
the gentlelady from New 
York, I believe, Long Island, for her 
gracious comments, to know that Billy 
Donovan also resided in her district. I 
think that is something that many of 
us did not know. 

Madam Speaker, I do have a little 
feeling of modesty here and graciousness 
coming here again to the floor. 
It’s almost like a great case of de´ja`vu 
again, because it seems like only a few 
months ago that I came to the floor to 
honor the University of Florida, which 
I represent, for winning the national 
football title. 

Yet here I am again, feeling a great 
deal of humbleeness, coming to the 
House floor to honor the Gators men’s 
basketball team, as pointed out, for becoming 
the first team since 1991–1992 to 
win back-to-back national titles. Of 
course, I am honored to represent the 
University of Florida, because it’s in 
my congressional district. As we say in 
Gainesville, ‘‘Go Gators.’’ We do indeed 
hope for another championship. 

With their win over the Ohio State 
Buckeyes on April 2, as mentioned, 
they became only the seventh school 
ever to repeat championships. In addition, 
Florida remains the only school 
in NCAA history to hold both the 

men’s basketball and football championship 
titles in the same year, which 
is an arduous feat, to say the least. 
This is quite an accomplishment, and 
one the entire university community 
should take a great deal of pride in, 
which they do. 

Many of the so-called experts said 
that the Gators would not be able to 
repeat as champions. However, all 
throughout the season, Coach Billy 
Donovan kept his team focused and on 
track and eventually proved the pundits 
wrong. The Gators were chasing 
history, so to speak, and they would 
not be denied. 

b 1400 
The Gators finished their season with 
an impressive 35–5, winning the final 10 
games of the season. Furthermore, my 
colleagues, they have an 18-game winning 
streak in the post-season, including 
sweeps at the Southeastern Conference 
tournament the last 2 years 
and a 12–0 in the NCAA tournament. 
By winning the championship, Coach 
Donovan became the 12th coach to win 
multiple men’s basketball championship 
and one of four active coaches to 
win multiple titles. He also became the 
third youngest coach to win more than 
one NCAA title. 
Now, Florida’s overall athletic program 
has proven to be one of the best 
in the Nation, now having won 21 national 
championships in all sports combined. 
Ten Gator athletic teams turned 
in top 10 finishes in 2005–2006. Florida is 
one of two schools to appear in the top 
10 in each of the last 23 national all-
sports ranking. 
I appreciate your indulgence here as 
I brag a little bit more. Gator athletes 
excel in the classroom as well. UF 
boasts a 91 percent graduation rate 
among its athletes, making it only one 
of four programs in the national all-
sports top 10 to achieve a graduation 
success rate above 90 percent. Furthermore, 
in the 2002–2003 season, UF 
placed a record of 193 student athletes 
on the SEC academic honor role, making 
six consecutive years UF placed 100 
or more student athletes on the SEC 
honor role. 
The University of Florida is more 
than just athletics. It ranks fifth 
among Kiplinger’s top 10 colleges and 
is among the Nation’s most academically 
diverse public universities. It is 
home to 16 colleges and more than 150 
research centers and institutes. And 
during the 2005–2006 school year, they 
awarded a little over $500 million in 
sponsored research to do such things as 
to find diverse research in health care, 
citrus production including the world’s 
largest citrus research center. 
In addition, my colleagues, more 
than 300,000 Gator alumni are located 
throughout the world. Famous alumni 
include two current NASA astronauts, 
actress Faye Dunaway, and home improvement 
expert Bob Vila. Just a little 
bragging there. 
UF’s faculty are among the best and 
most decorated in the world, winning 


H4230 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

awards such as the Fields medal, two 
Pulitzer Prizes, NASA’s top award for 
research, and the Smithsonian Institution’s 
Conservation award. Along with 
the faculty, the Gator students are 
among the brightest. UF admitted 
about 1,049 international baccalaureate 
students for the 2004–2005 academic 
year, more than any other university 
in the world. 

So the Florida men’s basketball team 
are excellent representatives of both 
the university and the great State of 
Florida in their focus, their persistence, 
and unassailable desire to succeed. 
I take great pride, my colleagues, 
in representing the University of Florida 
in Congress and congratulate Coach 
Billy Donovan and the entire university 
on this great accomplishment and 
hope for the best for next year. Go 
Gators. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield as much time as the 
gentleman may consume to another 
distinguished member of the Florida 
delegation, Mr. KELLER. 

Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 

Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
the University of Florida’s 
men’s basketball team on their second 
consecutive NCAA, Division I championship. 
On April 2 of this year, they 
joined only six other teams in NCAA 
history to win back-to-back championships. 
My congratulations also go out 
to Coach Billy Donovan, who has done 
a fine job with these young men, not 
only leading them to back-to-back 
championships but also for preparing 
them for what lies ahead in life. 

The University of Florida is a fine institution 
with many standout athletes. 
My home State of Florida and I are tremendously 
proud of their accomplishments 
on and off the field. The University 
of Florida is the only Division I 
college in history to win the national 
championship in basketball and football 
in the same calendar year. In fact, 
between the Gator championships in 
basketball and football, I don’t think 
there will be an athlete on campus who 
has not met the President by the time 
they graduate. 

Now, so many of these Gator basketball 
and football will be heading off to 
the NBA and NFL where they will have 
to struggle to make due on their multi-
million dollar salaries. The good news 
for many of these other schools is that 
a lot of the starters will be moving on. 
The bad news, of course, is I am hearing 
they are having their best recruiting 
classes ever in both football and 
basketball. Ohio State was such a worthy 
opponent both in football and basketball 
and handled themselves with so 
much class, much praise is warranted 
to the Buckeye fans as well. Congratulations 
on a job well done. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, we 
have got a great group of very proud 
Floridians here today. I am pleased to 
yield again as much time as the gentleman 
may consume to the gentleman, 
Mr. BILIRAKIS, from Florida. 

Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, it 
is with great Gator pride that I rise 
today to support this resolution honoring 
my alma mater, the University of 
Florida, on winning the 2007 NCAA 
men’s basketball championship. 

The Gators began this season looking 
to become the first team since 1992 to 
repeat as national champions. Everyone 
in the Gator nation anxiously anticipated 
this season’s tip-off, as all 
five starters unselfishly returned to 
school in hopes of making history. And 
they did. They became the only team 
in history to repeat as champions with 
the same starting lineup. 

Last year, this Gator team came 
from obscurity to win the championship. 
However, this year the Gators 
were expected to win, which made 
them a target for every school they 
played. These young men not only handled 
the pressure and scrutiny, but 
they used it to fuel another amazing 
title run through both the SEC and the 
NCAA tournament. 

Madam Speaker, I believe that this 
basketball team represents the true 
embodiment of sportsmanship and 
teamwork. For the last 2 years, these 
young men won with class, not selfishness. 
The five starters gave up their 
very lucrative NBA contracts to return 
to the school they loved. How refreshing. 
In today’s society, this an act that 
is remarkable. Believe it or not, it is 
remarkable. I want to commend all of 
them for their hard work and discipline. 


I also want to recognize Coach Billy 
Donovan and all of his assistants for 
the tremendous job they have done 
over the years. We are very lucky to 
have them, and I am glad he stayed at 
the University of Florida. 

Finally, I want to thank president 
Bernie Machen and athletic director 
Jeremy Foley, whose leadership made 
it possible for the Gators to be the only 
team in NCAA history to hold both the 
football and basketball titles simultaneously. 


I wish the University of Florida the 
best of luck in continuing this remarkable 
trend. And on behalf of my entire 
family, including my sons Michael, 
Teddy, Manuel, and Nicholas, thanks 
for making our dream come true, 
Gators. 

Madam Speaker, it truly is great to 
be a Florida Gator. 

Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may consume. 


The Florida Gators team will certainly 
go down as one of the best teams 
in the history of college basketball. 
After winning back-to-back championships 
this year, Coach Billy Donovan 
said, ‘‘I sit up here very, very humbled, 
because I think I was fortunate enough 
over the last 2 years to coach a group 

of guys that has to go down in history 
as one of the greatest teams of all 
time.’’ 

The love for the game and each 
other, the hustle and hard work that 
the players exemplified the past 2 years 
is something they certainly learned 
from their head coach, Billy Donovan. 
At the young age of 41, Coach Donovan 
is now in some elite company being one 
of only four active coaches to have won 
multiple championships. 

I extend my heartiest congratulations 
to Head Coach Donovan, all of 
the hardworking players, their fans, 
and all members of the University of 
Florida family, including another distinguished 
graduate of the University 
of Florida who I would be in trouble 
with if I didn’t mention when I go 
home tonight. My next oldest brother, 
Mark Platts, graduated in 1987 with a 
master’s degree from the University of 
Florida. 

I am happy to join with my chairwoman 
as well as my colleagues from 
Florida in honoring this exceptional 
team and all of its accomplishments 
and wish them continued success, unless 
they are playing my alma mater in 
the years to come. 

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, again I encourage my 
colleagues to pass H. Res. 298. And congratulations 
again and certainly may 
they have a great future. 

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
HARMAN). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. MCCARTHY) that the 
House suspend the rules and agree to 
the resolution, H. Res. 298. 

The question was taken.

CONGRATULATING CHARTER 

SCHOOLS FOR THEIR ONGOING 

CONTRIBUTIONS TO EDUCATION 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution (H. 
Res. 344) congratulating charter 
schools and their students, parents, 
teachers, and administrars across the 
United States for their ongoing contributions 
to education, and for other 
purposes. 

The Clerk read the title of the resolution. 
The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. RES. 344 

Whereas charter schools deliver high-quality 
education and challenge our students to 
reach their potential; 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4231 

Whereas charter schools provide thousands 
of families with diverse and innovative educational 
options for their children; 

Whereas charter schools are public schools 
authorized by a designated public entity that 
are responding to the needs of our communities, 
families, and students and promoting 
the principles of quality, choice, and innovation; 


Whereas in exchange for the flexibility and 
autonomy given to charter schools, they are 
held accountable by their sponsors for improving 
student achievement and for their financial 
and other operations; 

Whereas 40 States and the District of Columbia 
have passed laws authorizing charter 
schools; 

Whereas charter schools improve their students’ 
achievement and stimulate improvement 
in traditional public schools; 

Whereas charter schools must meet the 
student achievement accountability requirements 
under the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act of 1965 in the same manner as 
traditional public schools, and often set 
higher and additional individual goals to ensure 
that they are of high quality and truly 
accountable to the public; 

Whereas charter schools give parents new 
freedom to choose their public school, routinely 
measure parental satisfaction levels, 
and must prove their ongoing success to parents, 
policymakers, and their communities; 

Whereas charter schools nationwide serve 
a higher percentage of low-income and minority 
students than the traditional public 
system; 

Whereas charter schools have enjoyed 
broad bipartisan support from the Administration, 
Congress, State Governors and legislatures, 
educators, and parents across the 
United States; and 

Whereas the eighth annual National Charter 
Schools Week, to be held April 29 through 
May 5, 2007, is an event sponsored by charter 
schools and grassroots charter school organizations 
across the United States to recognize 
the significant impacts, achievements, and 
innovations of charter schools: Now, therefore, 
be it 

Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 


(1) acknowledges and commends charter 
schools and their students, parents, teachers, 
and administrators across the United States 
for their ongoing contributions to education 
and improving and strengthening our public 
school system; 
(2) supports the eighth annual National 
Charter Schools Week; and

people of the United States to conduct appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities 
to demonstrate support for charter 
schools during this weeklong celebration in 
communities throughout the United States.

from New York. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I request 5 legislative 
days during which Members may insert 
material relevant to H. Res. 344 into 
the RECORD. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentlewoman 
from New York? 

There was no objection. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 

(Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York asked 
and was given permission to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. 
BOUSTANY for introducing this resolution 
to honor National Charter School 
Week. He has been the sponsor of this 
resolution for the past 3 years, and we 
appreciate his leadership on this issue. 

Charter schools across the country 
are marking this occasion by opening 
their doors to the community and inviting 
them to learn about the role of 
charter schools in public education. 
With over 3,600 charter schools educating 
nearly 1.1 million children, 
charter schools have changed the landscape 
of public education. Almost 250 
schools are created each year. Committed 
parents and students and community 
leaders have led the way, creating 
charter schools to meet the needs 
of the local community. 

Charter schools are free from regulations 
but not accountability. There are 
model charter schools that are producing 
good outcomes for their students. 
The public school system in this 
country continues to generate innovative 
strategies for educating all children. 
Quality charter schools represent 
one model for this innovation. 

On the occasion of National Charter 
School Week, I want to commend the 
90,000 public schools in this country 
that are working hard to provide opportunity 
for children across the country. 
I urge my colleagues to support 
our Nation’s charter schools and to 
vote for this resolution. 

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
my friend and colleague from Louisiana 
(Mr. BOUSTANY). 

Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Pennsylvania 
for yielding time to me. 

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of House Resolution 344, congratulating 
charter schools and their students, 
parents, teachers, and 
administrars across the United States 
for their ongoing contributions to educational 
excellence. 

Charter schools are public schools 
that are created by teachers, parents, 
and other members of the community 
as innovative means to educate students 
and to stimulate reform in the 
public school system. As public 
schools, they must serve students from 
all backgrounds and educational abilities. 


In exchange for greater accountability 
for student achievements, these 
schools are exempt from many local 
and State regulations. Grassroots support 
for charter schools continues to 
grow, from one school in the 1992–1993 
school year, to over 4,000 schools serving 
over 1 million students in the 2006– 
2007 school year. 

b 1415 
The demand is simply remarkable. 
The charter model itself is playing a 

critical role in these schools’ success. 
Its flexibility and accountability are 
allowing individuals with nontraditional 
backgrounds and relentless attitudes 
to create high achievement cultures. 
These charter schools are setting 
new standards about what’s possible 
and about what we should expect from 
all our public schools. Indeed, charter 
schools are shattering low expectations 
and breaking through long standing 

barriers that have prevented large 
numbers of at-risk students from 
achieving educational success. 

Charter schools are usually among 
the top performers in big city school 
districts and often rival the highest 
performing schools in surrounding suburban 
districts. These high performers 
are setting important examples about 
what public schools can achieve with 
disadvantaged students. 

More and more data indicates that 
charter schools deliver promising results 
for student achievement. In an 
analysis of almost three dozen charter 
school studies, a vast majority found 
that overall gains in charter schools 
were larger than in other public 
schools, sometimes in certain significant 
categories of schools such as elementary 
schools, high schools or 
schools serving at risk students. 

Yet, even with these outstanding results, 
of the 40 States that have passed 
charter school laws, 25 States and the 
District of Columbia have some type of 
legislative cap on charter school 
growth. These caps serve as blunt instruments 
that do not lead to high 
quality schools. Instead of stifling 
growth, States should focus on providing 
the resources, oversight and accountability 
that helps charter schools 
thrive. 

We know what produces high quality 
charter schools—dedicated students, 
parents, teachers and principals, rigorous 
approval processes, conscientious 
oversight and sufficient resources, including 
facilities funding. We should 
work to replicate these models of best 
practices and apply them to local 
school districts throughout the country. 


It is my hope that the charter community 
will continue to build on its 15-
year history of providing a high quality 
option in public education that is 
based on innovation, freedom from red 
tape, and partnership between parents 
and educators, an option that is giving 
new hope to disadvantaged and minority 
families across the country. 

I also appreciate the contribution 
charter schools have made in ongoing 
efforts to rebuild and strengthen my 
home State of Louisiana after Hurricanes 
Rita and Katrina, particularly in 
New Orleans. 

For these reasons, it is my honor to 
congratulate charter schools and their 
students, parents, teachers and 
administrars across the United States 
for their ongoing contributions to education, 
as well as recognizing this week 
as National Charter School Week. I 
commend President Bush for his recent 


H4232 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

proclamation, ‘‘recognizing the important 
contributions of charter schools,’’ 
as well as my good friends and colleagues, 
Mr. PLATTS and Mrs. MCCARTHY 
for bringing this resolution to the 
floor. 

I urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 
2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman 
from Connecticut, Mr. CHRIS 
MURPHY. 

Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from 
New York and the gentlemen from 
Pennsylvania and Louisiana for bringing 
this resolution before us. 

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of this resolution to recognize the 
contributions of charter schools to education. 
So often we talk about the crisis 
of America’s schools and our educational 
system, but it’s equally important 
to take some time to recognize 
the good that’s being done. That’s why 
I welcome this opportunity to acknowledge 
the impact that charter schools 
are making in our education system 
nationally. 

In congratulating charter schools, I 
want to also acknowledge the work of 
all of our administrators and our educators 
in our public school system and 
our public charter school system as 
well. Noncharter public schools remain 
the bedrock of our educational system, 
and we need to make sure that we are 
doing everything here in Congress and 
at our State level to make sure that 
our public schools have the opportunity 
to succeed. 

But charter schools are growing because, 
when done right, they’re working. 
They represent a network of committed 
and innovative administrators, 
teachers and parents whose great determination 
and resolve complement 
the public education system. This national 
network of 4,000 charter schools 
infuses hope and possibility into communities. 
In Connecticut alone, there 
are 16 charter schools educating over 
2,500 students. 

Charter schools are infused with an 
imagination. Moreover, these schools 
are effectively engaging students 
around innovative and aggressive curriculum. 
They are setting the bar high 
and they are getting results. As we 
consider solutions for improving math 
and science education and increasing 
the number of high school graduates 
and students matriculating to colleges 
and university, we should remember 
the contributions that charter schools 
are making to the education of our Nation’s 
children. 

Again, Madam Speaker, I commend 
the tremendous dedication of all educators. 
Their unsung sacrifices are critical 
to ensuring the success of America’s 
youth today and the skill of tomorrow’s 
workforce. 

I urge all Members to support this 
resolution. 

Mr. PLATTS. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to support House Resolution 

344, congratulating charter schools and 
their students, parents, teachers and 
administrators across the United 
States for their ongoing contributions 
to education. 

Charter schools are innovative public 
schools with a simple interest in providing 
a quality education to children 
in their communities. They explore 
new educational approaches, such as 
longer school days or extended school 
years, and are free from most rules and 
regulations governing conventional 
public schools. 

These schools meet the student 
achievement and accountability requirements 
under No Child Left Behind 
in the same manner as traditional public 
schools and they often set higher individual 
goals to ensure that they are 
of high quality. 

Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join 
with my colleagues from New York, 
Louisiana, Connecticut, elsewhere 
around the country in recognizing 
these innovative public schools, and I 
am proud to recognize this week as National 
Charter Schools Week. 

I commend President Bush for his recent 
proclamation stating, quote, ‘‘recognizing 
the important contributions 
of charter schools,’’ as well on the executive 
branch side; and again urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote for this resolution. 

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 

Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, again, I would like to 
thank the gentleman from Louisiana 
(Mr. BOUSTANY) for introducing this 
legislation, and I urge my colleagues to 
support House Resolution 344. 

As you can tell, today we have been 
talking about the children of this Nation 
on so many of our different issues. 
And again, I am very happy to work 
with my colleague on the committee, 
Mr. PLATTS from Pennsylvania. 

When we talk about our children and 
the future of the Nation, obviously, 
education is the most important thing. 
So, again, it has been a pleasure introducing 
these resolutions. 

Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, as 
we celebrate charter schools I want to recognize 
the Youth Connection Charter School 
(YCCS) operating in my Congressional District. 
The Youth Connection Charter School 
(YCCS) has a unique mission and purpose. It 
has been said that education is the great 
equalizer—it is the key to success. 

The mission of YCCS is to provide individuals 
who have dropped out of school an opportunity—
to drop back in and receive a quality 
education. Since its creation in 1997, 
YCCS has graduated more than 5,700 students 
who had previously dropped out of traditional 
high schools. Just think, what would 
have happened to those students if YCCS 
was not available to them. They likely would 
have become another statistic. 

Clearly, the data shows that students who 
drop out are more likely to be unemployed. In 
fact, the unemployment rate nationally for high 
school drop-outs was 29.8 percent in 200. 
(Dept. of Labor). We know that students who 
drop out are more likely to be candidates for 
prisons. A total of 75 percent of America’s 

state prison inmates are high shool drop-outs, 
with only 59 percent of America’s federal prison 
inmates completing high school (Harlow, 
2003). We also know that high school drop-
outs are more likely to be receiving public assistance 
and living in poverty. These negative 
consequences lead to the destruction of a 
community and country. Students who drop 
out are less likely to be married or see a doctor 
on a regular basis. The benefits of a high 
school education move society forward economically 
and socially. A person with a high 
school diploma is more likely to be employed, 
live longer, and become a productive part of 
society. 

The impact of YCCS and its involvement as 
the only charter school in Illinois providing alternative 
educational services focused primarily 
on drop-outs can be seen throughout 
education. In 2005, YCCS placed in the upper 
third for school performance in reading by 
CPS in comparison to all of the other 76 high 
schools in the city of Chlcago. 

Conversely, we know that a quality education 
opens the doors of opportunity and provides 
hope for a brighter future. An investment 
in the education of young people who have 
dropped out of school saves our city and state 
taxpayers’ money. The Alliance for Excellent 
Education reports that a 1 percent increase in 
high school gradution rates would save approximately 
$1.4 billion in incarceration costs 
yearly. Additionally, a 1-year incease in average 
education levels would reduce arrest rates 
by 11 percent. 

I am pleased to honor the outstanding work 
of the Youth Connection Charter School. 

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
MCCARTHY) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 344. 

The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolution 
was agreed to. 

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

COMMEMORATING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE ABOLITION OF 
THE TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE 
TRADE 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 272) commemorating 
the 200th anniversary of the abolition 
of the transatlantic slave trade, 
as amended. 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4233 

The Clerk read the title of the resolution. 
The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. RES. 272 

Whereas the United Kingdom outlawed the 
African slave trade in 1807 by passing the 
Slave Trade Abolition Act which recognized 
that ‘‘the African Slave Trade, and all manner 
of dealing and trading in the Purchase, 
Sale, Barter, or Transfer of Slaves, or of Persons 
intended to be sold, transferred, used, or 
dealt with as Slaves, practiced or carried on, 
in, at, to or from any Part of the Coast or 
Countries of Africa, shall be, and the same is 
hereby utterly abolished, prohibited, and declared 
to be unlawful’’; 

Whereas the transatlantic slave trade entailed 
the kidnapping, purchase and commercial 
export of Africans, mostly from West 
and Central Africa, to the European colonies 
and new nations in the Americas, including 
the United States, where they were enslaved 
in forced labor between the 15th and late 
19th centuries; 

Whereas the term ‘‘Middle Passage’’ refers 
to the horrific part of the transatlantic slave 
trade when millions of Africans where 
chained together and stowed by the hundreds 
in overcrowded ships where they were forced 
into small spaces for months without relief 
as they were transported across the Atlantic 
Ocean to the Americas; 

Whereas historians claim that it is not 
possible to give an accurate number of slaves 
imported to the Americas from Africa, but 
scholars estimate that, at minimum, between 
10,000,000 and 15,000,000 Africans survived 
the Middle Passage, were imported as 
chattel through customs houses and ports 
across the Americas, and were sold into slavery; 


Whereas historians agree that many slaves 
arrived in the Americas ill with infections 
and diseases, disabled from the iron chains 
that bound them or from the physical abuse 
they endured, or traumatized by rape; 

Whereas historians estimate that 10 to 50 
percent of the Africans who were shipped 
from the continent perished during the Middle 
Passage as a result of physical abuses, 
torture, malnutrition, disease, infection, suicide 
or repercussions from their resistance to 
their bondage; 

Whereas Africans’ resistance to the transatlantic 
slave trade culminated in revolts— 
collective acts of rebellion—against slave 
ships and their crews during the Middle Passage, 
and rebellions against slavery occurred 
frequently on colonial and post-colonial 
plantations throughout the Americas; 

Whereas historians estimate that 1,200,000 
men, women, and children were later separated 
from their families and displaced from 
their communities by being sold to 
slaveholders in other regions, colonies, 
States, and nations in the inter-American 
and domestic slave trade that took place 
through much of the 19th century; 

Whereas the transatlantic slave trade is 
commonly recognized by historians as the 
largest forced migration in world history; 

Whereas, as a result of the slave trade, an 
estimated 80,000,000 to 150,000,000 persons of 
African descent live in Latin America and 
the Caribbean, making them the largest population 
of persons of African descent outside 
of Africa; 

Whereas the institution of slavery, which 
enslaved Africans, their progeny and later 
generations for life, was legally sanctioned 
by the colonial governments and later the 
nations and States engaged in slavery, including 
the Government of the United 
States, through most of the 19th century; 

Whereas slavery in the United States, during 
and after British colonial rule, included 

the sale and acquisition of Africans and African 
Americans as chattel property in interstate 
and intrastate commerce; 

Whereas enslaved Africans and African 
Americans were defined as property that 
passed to heirs under inheritance laws of the 
British colonial rule and later under the laws 
of the various States; 

Whereas enslaved Africans adapted to their 
environment and created a new, rich culture 
that marked the development of the African 
American community and continues to 
strongly impact culture and society in the 
United States today; 

Whereas the slavery that flourished in the 
United States constituted an immoral and 
inhumane dispossession of human life, liberty, 
and citizenship rights and denied Africans 
and African Americans the fruits of 
their own labor; 

Whereas the treatment of enslaved Africans 
and African Americans in the colonies 
and the United States included the deprivation 
of their freedom, exploitation of their 
labor, psychological and physical abuse, separation 
of families, and the targeted efforts 
to repress their culture, language, and religion 
through legal and social restrictive 
measures; 

Whereas enslavement has been defined as a 
crime against humanity pursuant to the 
Nuremberg Charter (Agreement for the Prosecution 
and Punishment of the Major War 
Criminals of the European Axis, entered into 
force on August 8, 1945 (82 U.N.T.S. 279)), and 
subsequent international tribunals for war 
crimes; 

Whereas the United Nations has adopted 
various treaties, declarations, and conventions 
and hosted conferences that condemn 
slavery and the slave trade, including the 
transatlantic slave trade, and has acknowledged 
that such acts were barbaric in their 
nature and were appalling tragedies; 

Whereas the slave trade and the legacy of 
slavery continue to have a profound impact 
on social and economic disparity, hatred, 
bias, racism, and discrimination, and continue 
to affect people of African descent 
throughout the Americas today; and 

Whereas March 25, 2007, marked the 200th 
anniversary of the Slave Trade Abolition Act 
enacted by the British Parliament: Now, 
therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 


(1) recognizes the historical significance of 
the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the 
transatlantic slave trade to the people of the 
United States and to the world; 
(2) respects the memory of those who died 
as a result of slavery, including through exposure 
to the horrors of the Middle Passage 
and in revolt against, and resistance to, enslavement; 
(3) supports the preservation of historical 
records and documents in private collections, 
local and State governments, shipping 
ports, and corporations in the United States 
and throughout the Americas relating to the 
transatlantic slave trade and the centuries 
of slavery that followed; and 
(4) urges increased education of current 
and future generations about slavery and its 
vestiges by honoring their significance in 
United States history and the history of 
other nations of the Americas with appropriate 
research, scholarship, curriculum, 
textbooks, museum exhibits and programs, 
library resources and programs, and cultural 
programs and activities. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE) and the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. ROS-
LEHTINEN) each will control 20 minutes. 

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the resolution under 
consideration. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from New Jersey? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of this resolution and 
yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 

I would like to first commend our 
distinguished colleague and former 
member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, 
Ms. LEE of California, for introducing 
this very important resolution. 

I am honored and humbled to commemorate 
the 200th anniversary of the 
abolition of transatlantic slave trade 
with this resolution, for its legacy continues 
to reflect the racial biases and 
socioeconomic disparities that still 
exist in this country and throughout 
the Americas. 

As we consistently admonish the 
prevalence of modern-day slavery 
worldwide, because it still exists in 
some parts of the world, it would be 
hypocritical if we did not acknowledge 
the history of transatlantic slave trade 
which existed for so long in this country, 
and therefore it is appropriate that 
we speak about it at this time, its 200th 
anniversary. 

For over 300 years the United Kingdom 
and other European countries kidnapped 
and sold millions of Africans 
into slavery. The transatlantic slave 
trade is known as the largest forced 
migration in the history of the world. 
Estimates range from 25 to 50 million 
Africans were forcibly brought to the 
United States, the Caribbean, Central 
and South America and to Europe. 
Sharks migratory patterns were 
changed because these predators followed 
the ships in the Middle Passage 
because when a slave died they were 
thrown overboard, or if they were 
killed because they were protesting, or 
if they committed suicide, the sharks 
knew that they could follow the ships, 
and it changed the migratory patterns 
of sharks during this period of time. 

African labor was an essential feature 
of economic development in Europe 
and her former colonies, including 
the United States. All of the nations 
involved flourished economically as a 
result of slave labor. 

The fact that slavery was not abolished 
in the United States until Abraham 
Lincoln declared to end slavery in 
the Confederacy in 1863 with the Emancipation 
Proclamation. However, slavery 
was really not abolished in the 
Union. 

Interestingly enough, in my State of 
New Jersey, slavery continued until 
1866. In New Jersey, a mother, a woman 
could become free at the age of 21, and 
a man at the age of 25, but their children 
had to continue in slavery. And so 


H4234 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

the emancipation only freed slaves in 
the Confederacy, and did not free 
slaves in the Union. And so, as I have 
indicated in New Jersey, there were 
still slaves a year after the end of the 
Civil War in 1866. 

The dignity of our Nation demands 
our recognition of this tragic part of 
American history. I extend my highest 
respect and appreciation for the contributions 
and struggles of African 
Americans to create an equitable and 
just society from which we all benefit 
today. 

I strongly support this resolution, 
and urge my colleagues to do the same. 

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 

Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, 
thank you for bringing up this important 
resolution to this floor today. 
And I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of House Resolution 272, which 
recognizes the historical significance 
of the abolition of transatlantic slave 
trade. It respects the memory of those 
who perished as a result of slavery. It 
supports preservation of related historical 
documents, and it urges greater 
education about this sad period in history 
for both current and future generations. 


b 1430 
While addressing the Community of 
Democracies’ opening plenary in Chile 
on April 29, 2005, Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice stated: ‘‘We at the 
Community of Democracies must use 
the power of our shared ideals to accelerate 
democracy’s movement to ever 
more places around the globe. We must 
usher in an era of democracy that 
thinks of tyranny as we thought of 
slavery today: a moral abomination 
that could not withstand the natural 
desire of every human being for a life 
of liberty and of dignity.’’ 
While Secretary Rice’s remarks were 
specifically on the promotion of democracy 
around the world, she reminded 
us of a very unsettling fact. 
Even 200 years after the abolition of 
the slave trade in the United Kingdom 
and nearly 145 years after the Emancipation 
Proclamation in our United 
States, slavery still exists in the modern 
world. It exists through tyranny. It 
exists through oppression. It exists 
where human rights and freedom are 
systematically repressed. 
Secretary Rice’s statement serves as 
a call to action for those of us who 
would seek to break the shackles of 
tyranny and promote human dignity 
around the world. 
I appreciate the bipartisan fashion by 
which we have sought to heed the Secretary’s 
call and to recognize the significance 
of the abolition of the transatlantic 
slave trade, as evidenced by 
our consideration today of both this 
resolution by the Congresswoman from 
California (Ms. LEE) and House Resolution 
158, offered by the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. PITTS). Collectively, 

these resolutions remind us of the 
courage and the fortitude of those who 
came before us to fight the scourge of 
slavery, while helping us come to 
terms with our own shameful past. 

I believe that there would be no better 
way to respect the memory of those 
forced to suffer under the horrors of 
the transatlantic slave trade, or to 
honor those who dedicated themselves 
to its abolition, than to stand together 
today in a bipartisan fashion and publicly 
recommit ourselves to the eradication 
of slavery and the promotion of 
human rights around the world. 

Madam Speaker, I again thank you 
for bringing this important resolution 
to the floor. 

Madam Speaker, because I know that 
the gentleman from New Jersey and 
the gentlewoman from California have 
many speakers on their side, except for 
the 2 minutes that I would like to yield 
to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. 
BURTON) to comment on this important 
resolution, I yield the balance of my 
time to the gentleman from New Jersey 
(Mr. PAYNE), and I ask unanimous 
consent that he be allowed to control 
that time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from New 
Jersey will control the balance of the 
time except for 2 minutes. 

There was no objection. 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her generosity. 


Madam Speaker, at this time I would 
like to yield 7 minutes to the sponsor 
of the resolution, Representative BARBARA 
LEE from the Ninth District of 
California, member of the Committee 
on Appropriations. 

Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, let me 
thank the gentleman from New Jersey 
for yielding and for your leadership, 
Mr. PAYNE, in making sure that this 
resolution came to the floor today in a 
bipartisan way and also for making 
sure that the history of African Americans, 
which, of course, started during 
the Middle Passages, is told not only 
here on the floor of Congress but in our 
public schools. So thank you very 
much. 

Let me thank our ranking member, 
Congresswoman ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, 
and also Mr. LANTOS for their leadership 
and for their assistance. 

And let me take a moment to acknowledge 
our staff, because they have 
worked very diligently. And not only 
do they work for us. They really do believe 
in what we are doing, Madam 
Speaker: Kristin Wells, Pearl Alice 
Marsh, Joan Condon, Genora Reed, and 
Ven Neralla from my office. They have 
done remarkable work in a bipartisan 
fashion to get this resolution to the 
floor. 

This resolution, Madam Speaker, H. 
Res. 272, commemorates a very somber 
and very serious occasion, the 200th anniversary 
of the abolition of the transatlantic 
slave trade by the United 
Kingdom. Two hundred years ago on 
March 25 in 1807, Great Britain abol


ished the transatlantic slave trade in 
England and its colonies. This act 
began a worldwide revolt against the 
trade of human beings by other European 
nations. 

This is a very important milestone 
because it represents the beginning of 
the end of one of the most deplorable, 
deplorable chapters in human history. 

Madam Speaker, on several occasions, 
like many of my colleagues, I 
have had the overwhelmingly heart-
wrenching, and I mean heart-wrenching, 
experience of traveling to the 
areas from where slaves were captured 
and put on ships for that deadly passage 
to America from Africa. And this 
is called, of course, the Middle Passage. 
One of my most distinct memories was 
standing on several occasions at the 
‘‘doors of no return’’ in Ghana and in 
Senegal. Every slave castle has such a 
door. This door represents so many 
things to me. At this door my ancestors 
stood on the shores of their homeland 
for the last time in their lives. At 
this door a fate awaited them that I 
wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. And 
over 400 years later, there I was standing 
in the doors as one of their descendants 
who survived and returned. 

Standing in front of those doors, it is 
really impossible for me to ignore the 
fact that those who walked chained 
through those doors laid the foundation 
of many modern nations that have 
a colonial past, including the United 
States of America. 

The slave trade was vital to England 
and other European colonial powers. It 
provided the basis for modern capitalism 
to take root, generating immense 
wealth for business enterprises 
in colonial America and Europe. In 
many ways the industrial strength of 
our Nation was built on the blood, 
sweat, and tears of African American 
free labor. Free labor. Today, this 
great country of ours, the United 
States of America, reaps the fruits of 
labor of these enslaved Africans, and 
we cannot forget that. 

However, in spite of the considerable 
riches enslaved Africans created for 
others, what the slave trade also represented 
was really the lowest expression 
of humanity, and I mean the lowest 
expression. Captured Africans were 
subjected to the worst forms of cruelty 
and inhumanity. Millions were 
crammed in the hulls of slave ships 
like sardines in a can. The stench of 
filth and death reeked from the ships. 
Disease ran rampant through the ships. 
Traders used any means of violence to 
subdue insurrection, including torture, 
mutilations, and rape. The death rate 
during transport would reach as high 
as 50 percent. The world will never 
know really the exact number of 
enslaved Africans transported to America, 
but it is estimated that between 10 
to 15 million were brought here to the 
United States, making it the largest 
forced migration in history. 

Given its immense significance, it is 
unfortunate that the transatlantic 
slave trade is a subject only briefly discussed 
in our Nation’s classrooms, and 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4235 

the study of the transatlantic slave 
trade really, if you ask me, should be a 
requirement for all of our public 
schools. It is essential that we acknowledge 
how slavery created attitudes 
of racism that persist in our society 
today. 

Sadly, the legacy of the slave trade 
and slavery are with us to this day. 
Just consider these facts: nearly one 
quarter of African Americans in the 
United States live in poverty. African 
Americans have one of the highest unemployment 
rates at 9.6 percent, and of 
the 46 million who lack health insurance, 
about 20 percent are African 
American and many of these are children. 


Slavery may be over, at least legalized 
slavery may be over, but in many 
ways the vestiges remain. That is why, 
Madam Speaker, it is important that 
we are considering this resolution 
today. We must honor the memory and 
the legacy and the courage of those 
who died in slavery and those who 
worked to end it. But at the same time, 
we must use this occasion to recommit 
ourselves to eliminating the disparities 
that exist in our society. We must not 
let their sacrifices be in vain. 

Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to claim my 2 
minutes, and then I will yield to my 
colleague. 

First of all, let me just say that this 
is a very important resolution. I don’t 
think many people in America really 
understand or remember all of the horrible 
things that occurred during the 
slave trading that took place in the 
past. 

There is a movie out right now that 
talks about the slave trade and how 
horrible it was. It is called ‘‘Amazing 
Grace.’’ And I don’t tout movies very 
much, but I would submit to all of my 
colleagues they ought to go see that 
movie. It is about William Wilberforce, 
who has been a hero of mine for a long 
time since I was a State legislator, and 
he led the fight in England to abolish 
slave trading; and it took him, I think, 
18 years to get it done. But he was a 
real crusader for the rights of man and 
for the ending of slave trading. 

So I would say to my colleague, Ms. 
LEE, I think this is a great bill you introduced. 
I whole heartedly support it, 
and I hope everybody in this House 
will. And as I said before, we ought to 
remember the horrible fight, the great 
fight that took place in ending slavery 
in England and in subsequent years. 

So this is a great resolution. I really 
appreciate your bringing it forward. 

And I hope everybody will remember 
William Wilberforce and the fight he 
made to end slavery and slave trading 
in England. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman 
from New Jersey will control 
the remainder of the time, and there 
are 231/2 minutes remaining in this debate. 


Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas, Representative EDDIE BERNICE 

JOHNSON, chairman of the Transportation 
and Infrastructure’s Subcommittee 
on Water Resources and Environment. 


Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of 
Texas. Madam Speaker, let me say 
thanks to Mr. PAYNE and Ms. LEE for 
bringing this forth. 

I rise today in support of this resolution 
to commemorate the 200th anniversary 
of the abolition of the transatlantic 
slave trade. 

This anniversary marks a significant 
moment in not only American history 
but the history of the world. For 300 
years the transatlantic slave trade represented 
one of the most horrific periods 
in the history of human events. 
During this time, 12 million Africans 
were captured and brought to America 
as slaves. Millions more did not survive 
this horrific trip overseas, which could 
have lasted as long as 3 months. These 
individuals forcibly gave their lives 
and freedom to build the economic future 
of America, which includes this 
Capitol. 

While nothing can replace lives or 
freedom, it is important to acknowledge 
that the consequences of slavery 
still exist. While 200 years may have 
passed since the end of the transatlantic 
slave trade, the legacy of racism 
still persists. Today we take a step 
forward in healing those wounds by 
recognizing the past and acknowledging 
the impact it still has on our 
Nation. 

I would like to thank Representative 
LEE for writing this and bringing it 
forth. Because all too often, we think 
nobody remembers but us, those who 
still suffer from this horrific period in 
our history. 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina, Representative G. K. 
BUTTERFIELD, the vice chairman of the 
Energy and Commerce Subcommittee 
on Energy and Air Quality. 

Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, 
I also want to thank the gentleman 
from New Jersey, my friend Congressman 
DONALD PAYNE, for his tireless efforts 
on behalf of the continent of Africa 
and other related issues. I also want 
to thank the gentlewoman from California 
for her work on this resolution. 
And, hopefully, we will pass this resolution 
and move forward with greater 
work of this Congress. 

Madam Speaker, this Nation has yet 
to fully come to terms with and recognize 
the institution of slavery that existed 
in this country for so long. Slavery 
is perhaps the most underrecognized 
crime against humanity in the 
history of the world. 

Madam Speaker, I am often asked 
about my light complexion. Some people 
do it out of curiosity and it does 
not offend me, but I am often asked 
about my complexion. It is a fact that 
I am indeed an African American. My 
great-grandmother was a slave. 

b 1445 
And my great grandfather was the 
slave master. And my situation is not 

unique. The enslavement of millions of 
people who were taken from the west 
coast of Africa still affects millions of 
Americans today. 

I represent the First Congressional 
District of North Carolina. My area of 
the country was one of the destinations 
of the slave trade. My congressional 
district today suffers from the effects 
from slavery. My constituents, half of 
whom are African American, suffer 
from disparities across the spectrum. I 
can trace directly these conditions to 
the fact that their foreparents were legally 
denied citizenship and the benefits 
of citizenship. Even after slavery 
ended, the United States continued to 
disrespect black citizens and forced 
them to endure inferior schools, health 
care, income and the like. 

In my hometown of Wilson, North 
Carolina, my mother did not have access 
to a public education beyond the 
sixth grade. Had she lived in the rural 
area of my county, she would not have 
had the benefit of any education, save 
only a token opportunity offered by 
black churches. When my mother left 
the sixth grade, she was given an opportunity 
to move to another city to 
get an education, and it made a difference. 
She returned to our home community 
and became a teacher for 48 
years and instilled in my generation 
the importance of education. There 
were hundreds of thousands who were 
denied educational opportunities, and 
their descendants today continue to 
suffer. 

Madam Speaker, we have a tremendous 
responsibility as a Nation to remedy 
past wrongs. This resolution commemorating 
the 200th anniversary of 
the abolition of the transatlantic slave 
trade is a step in the right direction. 
We must do more. Poverty is pervasive. 
This Congress must set the tone and 
begin the process of healing and remedy 
the cruelty of slavery and racial 
discrimination. 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentlewoman from the 
11th District of New York, Representative 
YVETTE CLARKE, a member of the 
Commerce and Small Business Committee. 


Ms. CLARKE. Thank you very much 
to Representative PAYNE and to the 
gentlelady from California. 

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 272, a resolution commemorating 
the 200th anniversary of 
the abolition of the transatlantic slave 
trade. 

The abolition of the trade was an important 
milestone in the fight against 
slavery, but that campaign continued 
throughout the 19th century and it still 
continues today. 

Currently, 27 million people are held 
in slavery around the world. Like the 
slaves of the past, slaves of today are 
controlled by violence, and suffer the 
theft of their labor and humanity. 

Our commemoration today rings hollow 
if we do not learn from the lessons 
of the abolition movement of the past. 
That botched emancipation of 1865 


H4236 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

forced four million ex-slaves into the 
economic social society with no access 
to education, political participation or 
equal citizenship, nor a true recognition 
of their humanity. 

As I reflect on my own history as a 
descendant of African slaves who were 
survivors of the Middle Passage, my 
ancestors, kidnapped, brutalized and 
brought to the island Nation of Jamaica 
West Indies where centuries 
later my parents were born, who then 
migrated as subjects of the Queen to 
Brooklyn, New York, where I was born. 

The history of Africans in the Americas 
has been suppressed as evidenced 
by the lack of presence in our school’s 
curriculums. Today, we see the results 
of granting freedom without dignity. 
People of African descent still face economic 
inequality, social inequality and 
racism. 

Slavery can be brought to an end 
within our lifetime. Madam Speaker, it 
is my prayer that someday soon this 
body will be celebrating of the global 
eradication of slavery. And in the spirit 
of the liberation and suffrage of my 
ancestors, the Civil Rights movement, 
human rights for every man, woman 
and child will be recognized. The liberty 
and the dreams of all will be attained 
through their collective will 
will not go unnoticed. We are not going 
to achieve true liberty unless and until 
we all embrace our collective and diverse 
humanity together. 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from the 
Seventh District of Illinois, chairman 
of the Oversight and Government Reform 
Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, 
Postal Service and the District 
of Columbia, Representative DANNY K. 
DAVIS. 

Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of H. Res. 
272, commemorating the 200th anniversary 
of the abolition of the transatlantic 
slave trade. I also rise in 
honor of my forefathers and 
foremothers who were captured 
through raids and kidnappings, sold to 
Europeans and subjugated to four and a 
half centuries of the transatlantic 
slave trade. 

The transatlantic slave trade is 
sometimes called ‘‘Maafa,’’ meaning 
‘‘holocaust’’ or ‘‘great disaster’’ in 
Kiswahili by African and African 
American scholars because it resulted 
in a vast loss of life for African captives 
both in Africa and in America. It 
is believed that 50 percent of African 
deaths, 10 million, occurred in Africa 
as a result of wars between native 
tribes. 4.5 percent, around 900,000 
deaths, occurred in large forts called 
factories. Around 2.5 million Africans 
died during voyages through the infamous 
Middle Passage, where they were 
packed into tight, unsanitary spaces on 
ships for months at a time. 

While estimates of the number of 
slaves brought to North America vary 
from a few hundred thousand to a few 
million, the slave population in the 
United States had grown to 4 million 

by the 1860s. From the latter 18th century, 
and possibly before that even, 
until the Civil War, the rate of natural 
growth of North American slaves was 
much greater than the population of 
any nation in Europe and was nearly 
twice as rapid as that in Europe. In 
North America, the treatment of slaves 
was very harsh and inhumane. Whether 
laboring or walking about in public, 
slaves were regulated by legally authorized 
violence. On large plantations, 
slave overseers were authorized to whip 
and brutalize noncompliant slaves. Significantly, 
slave codes authorized, indemnified 
or even required the use of 
violence and were denounced by abolitionists 
for their brutality. 

In the present phase of society, we 
must recognize the historical significance 
of the 200th anniversary of the 
abolition of the transatlantic slave 
trade to the world. More broadly, respect 
the memories of those who gave 
their lives in the fight for freedom, and 
make sure that no generations yet to 
come will ever experience this kind of 
inhumane brutality. 

And so I commend Representative 
LEE for introducing this resolution, 
commend Representative PAYNE for his 
tremendous leadership in human 
rights. 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the 
Representative from the Sixth District 
of California, Representative LYNN 
WOOLSEY. 

Ms. WOOLSEY. I want to thank 
Chairman PAYNE and Congressman 
BARBARA LEE for bringing this important 
issue before us today. 

Madam Speaker, I rise as a cosponsor 
and in support of H. Res. 272, which 
celebrates the end of what was one of 
the most horrific and immoral human 
rights abuses in history, slavery. 

The slave trade must be remembered. 
It has to be remembered for its brutality, 
for its inhumane cruelty, and 
for the injustices that it caused millions 
of families. I say families, because 
for every one of the more than 12 
million Africans forced from his or her 
homeland, subjected to the Middle Passage, 
that terrifying journey on slave 
ships, overwhelmed by disease and left 
in famine, every one of those folks left 
a family behind in grief or they were 
separated by slave traders. These 
human beings taken from their homeland 
and stripped of their freedom suffered 
more than a loss of their humanity 
and of their families, however; 
many times they lost their very culture, 
their language, their religion and 
their true homeland. 

It is important to remember that 
many of those captured in the slave 
trade did not survive the journey. Indeed, 
for every 100 slaves who reached 
the new world, another 40 died in Africa 
or during the Middle Passage. 

This resolution, H.R. 272, is important 
because it recognizes the injustices 
of the transatlantic slave trade 
and the historical significance of its 
abolition. In order to come to terms 

with slavery and the impression of 
black Americans in our past, it is also 
important that we acknowledge not 
only the historical events of the slave 
trade and of slavery, but also its legacy, 
its lasting effects on the lives of 
every single American. 

We see even today the long-term consequences 
of slavery in the persistent 
inqualities between black and white 
Americans, the economic disparities, 
poverty rates, and the discrimination 
that still lives in our country today. 
Educating and teaching future generations 
about the historical wrongs of 
the slave trade can help because it 
could help prevent such crimes against 
humanity in the future, but it will also 
identify many forms of slavery that 
still exist, forms that we pretend aren’t 
there. 

So I urge my colleagues, support H.R. 
272. 

Mr. PAYNE. I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlelady from the 18th District of 
Texas, Representative SHEILA JACKSON-
LEE, chairwoman of the Homeland Se


curity Subcommittee on Transportation, 
Security and Infrastructure 
Protection. 

(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked 
and was given permission to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Let me 
thank the distinguished gentleman 
from New Jersey, the chairman of the 
Africa Subcommittee on the Foreign 
Affairs Committee. I thank the author 
and sponsor of this legislation, it is 
historic. And certainly, I thank the 
ranking member of the full committee 
for her leadership and presence here on 
the floor today and our full committee 
Chair. 

This is a day that really emphasizes 
the long and diverse history of this Nation. 
It is a day that I hope that members 
of this body will unanimously pass 
this legislation, H. Res. 272. 

Certainly, the historic aspect of it 
has already been noted, some 10 million 
to 15 million Africans were transported 
as slaves across the Atlantic. It does 
not, however, add all of the history 
when you look at the broadness of this 
question of slavery and America. What 
it really did to America was carve out 
this issue of race. And Judge 
Higgenbotham made it very clear as he 
rendered decisions on segregation and 
separation, that in this Nation, race 
matters. This historical perspective 
now puts all of this horrible legacy in 
place, and it does so as America. It 
does so, it speaks to America about the 
horribleness of the slave trade. It adds 
that this was not a very positive part 
of America’s history, but it is part of 
America’s history. It does so in the 
backdrop of the commemoration of the 
400th year of Jamestown, 1607. And the 
first slaves that came over were actually 
from Angola. The person who 
fought against the slaves who were 
being taken was a woman warrior of 
the tribes in that part. 

Just a few weeks ago, I saw the reenactment 
or the refilming, if you will, 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4237 

or the reshowing of Roots, the Alex 
Haley Roots, on TV1, interestingly 
enough, a station and a company 
owned by an African American woman. 
And it brought home again the fierceness 
of slavery, the violence of slavery, 
and in fact, that these slaves were 
taken and violated and abused. And 
those that came over and made it here 
were infected with disease, they were 
suffering from rape and they had been 
brutalized. 

b 1500 
This is an important statement. But 
a more important statement is the 
vestiges of slavery, and I am glad to 
have joined the Honorable Congresswoman 
BARBARA LEE and a number of 
others who went to South Africa to the 
Conference on Racism, organized by 
the United Nations in 2001. That was a 
very, very important effort, and I am 
glad that Members of Congress did not 
accept the administration’s rejection 
of going to that conference. It was 
vital for us to be there. It was a vital 
part of the healing process, because it 
had to do with racism around the 
world. In fact, we know today that 
slavery still exists around the world. 
So as we stand here today, we acknowledge 
the horribleness of the slave 
history of this country, but we also 
condemn slavery that exists today 
around the world, in parts of Asia, in 
parts of Africa, in parts of South and 
Central America, in parts of all aspects 
of the world, possibly even in Europe, 
where people are held against their 
will. 
But the United Nations conference 
was to speak to the issue of stamping 
out the vestiges of slavery, so that we 
could do it in unity, so that we could 
respect each other for our dignity and 
for where we have come from, our religious 
difference, our racial difference, 
even our regional and country differences. 
That is why this resolution is so important, 
because it says to the world 
that the United States House of Representatives 
accepts and acknowledges 
the wrongness of slavery, but we are 
going forward. We also recognize the 
vestiges of slavery, and we must go forward 
to end that separation on the 
basis of race. We must be able to say 
that race matters in a positive way. 

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. 
Res. 272, commemorating the Abolition of the 
Transatlantic Slave Trade. 

When slavery was introduced into the European 
colonies in 1619, the dark days that followed 
ignited the faith and hope of our ancestors 
that one day their descendants would live 
in freedom and helped them bear the unbearable 
burden of bondage. For over 300 years, 
the United Kingdom and other European countries 
kidnapped and sold millions of Africans 
into slavery; contemporary historians estimate 
that between 9.4 and 12 million Africans arrived 
in the new world. Although on March 25, 
1807, the United Kingdom outlawed the African 
Slave trade by passing the Slave Trade 
Abolition Act, the road to freedom was a perilous 
one, and without Abolitionist movements, 

protests, and opposition, would not have been 
realized. 

Madam Speaker, it is important to commemorate 
this occasion so that the world will 
not quickly forget the incorrigible injustices African-
Americans suffered as slaves and the 
humiliation and degradation they bore when 
they were taken and adjudged to be real estate, 
the same category as livestock, household 
furniture, wagons and goods. 

Although slavery was long, vicious and arduous, 
African slaves were instrumental in the 
economic development of this Nation and allowed 
Europe and the United States of America 
to be built. Slaves were the foundation of 
the country—today we recognize the end of 
this heinous trade of human cargo. It was from 
the institutional slave trade of Africans that the 
strong African-American people who have survived 
despite racism and second class citizenship 
emerged in the United States. 

As we condemn the atrocities, human rights 
abuses, and modern-day slavery worldwide, it 
would be hypocritical if we did not acknowledge 
the history of the transatlantic slave 
trade and slavery that existed not long ago in 
our country. 

The end of slavery did not come to pass 
until 1865, when the United States ratified the 
13th amendment to the constitution. But the 
fight for equality against injustices, though 
easier today, still carries on. The consequences 
of the slave trade have been profound 
and the scars that it produced still have 
not healed. The most serious legacy is the endurance 
of racism in various forms that keep 
changing, but do not seem to dissipate. 

Madam Speaker, we are committed to overcoming 
this legacy and assuring a just world 
society. The dignity of African-Americans demands 
recognition of the tragic history of the 
slavery era. It is for that reason that I rise in 
strong support of H. Res. 272, commemorating 
the 200th Anniversary of the Abolition of 
the Transatlantic Slave Trade. I urge all members 
to do likewise. 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlelady from California 
(Ms. SOLIS), a member of the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce. 

Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman of our subcommittee, and 
I stand in strong support of House Resolution 
272. 

As the daughter of immigrants, I understand 
very clearly what it means 
when individuals are brought to a 
country either of their own free will or 
against their will. In the case of Latin 
American immigrants coming to this 
country, many fled because of poverty 
and injustices, sometimes civil wars. 

In the case of our brothers and sisters 
from Africa, many were brought here 
as slaves and were indentured and 
never were paid for the hard work that 
they provided. In fact, a large number, 
hundreds of thousands, reside in the 
Caribbean and in Latin America. We 
are also descendants of those individuals, 
and we should proudly proclaim 
that we not forget that part of our history 
and that it go down and be noted 
and that we do everything in our power 
to help educate future generations 
about the injustices that exist, existed, 
and continue to exist in this country 
now. Whether it be forced slave labor 

in our sweatshops or whether it be the 
maquiladoras in Mexico or Central 
America, there are many people who 
are still suffering from enslavement. 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
31/2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
the 13th District of Michigan (Ms. KILPATRICK), 
the chairperson of the Congressional 
Black Caucus and a member 
of the Appropriations Committee. 

Ms. KILPATRICK. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 

Madam Speaker, I also want to thank 
my colleague, Congresswoman BARBARA 
LEE from the great State of California, 
for offering this resolution, 
House Resolution 272, commemorating 
the 200th anniversary of the end of the 
transcontinental slave trade for our 
country. Awesome that it is, we thank 
the President who signed that proclamation 
and that we began to work as 
one country with many ethnicities in 
our country. 

Slavery is a cruel, unusual, inhumane 
treatment. Many of us just returned 
from overseas and were in the 
slave dungeons, and to see the inhumane 
treatment that many of our ancestors 
felt then and some vestiges of 
it today is awesome. But we are still 
here. We are still here running businesses, 
contributing to America. We 
are still here attending universities 
and in the Halls of this Congress of the 
United States of America. 

We have much work to do, 200 years, 
and we hope thousands of years from 
now, because, you see, Africans 
brought the gifts of civilization, religion 
and science to the world, documented 
in anthropological studies, the 
first man. 

So it’s unfortunate but it’s past, 
chattel slavery, but we have much 
work to do. We need better schools. We 
have got to be the best that we can be, 
first class, no exceptions, and we accept 
that responsibility. 

To my young sisters and brothers 
across this Nation of all ethnic persuasions, 
rise up and be the very best that 
you can be. Never let anyone take the 
intellect, the intelligence or the mastery 
that God has given you to be the 
very best. Slavery is an abominable 
crime that we must never have again 
for any race of people, and in vestiges 
around the world, we see pockets of it. 

But we rise today to support House 
Resolution 272, and to ask as Americans 
and people of the world that we 
build together a stronger America, 
where people have access to quality 
education that helps us to compete 
with the Chinas and the Taiwans and 
the Indias of the world, that we rise as 
a Nation of Americans and that we 
never again forget that all people are 
created by one God known by many 
names. 

So I stand here as Chair of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, one of 435 
Members of this Congress, one of 43 
members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, to say to America, we are still 
the best country in the world. We still 
have a lot to achieve, and as we improve 
our schools, as we invest our 


H4238 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

moneys, this $3 trillion budget that we 
have in this country, make sure that 
this Congress, this administration, the 
people rise up to have a fair immigration 
policy, to have fair schools that 
are funded, that are technologically 
sound to compete. 

And we pledge to you as African 
Americans, we will produce young people 
and others who are rising up, owning 
their own businesses, doing what 
we need to do to do our part so that our 
children know that we are the best, we 
intend to be the best, and we want the 
doors of opportunity to stay open so 
that access will be there. 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

Madam Speaker, let me thank the 
gentlelady from California once again. 
As she said, we hope that the history 
will be integrated into our textbooks. 
In New Jersey, I am proud to say, William 
Payne, assemblyman, passed 
Amistad legislation that will integrate 
the history of African Americans in the 
history of New Jersey. Our current 
Member of Congress, ALBIO SIRES, was 
the Speaker of the Assembly when that 
great legislation was brought through 
with his assistance. 

When we read about Patrick Henry, 
who said, ‘‘Give me liberty or give me 
death,’’ or Nathan Hale, who said ‘‘I regret 
that I only have one life to give 
for my country,’’ we will read about 
Crispus Attucks, the first person killed 
in the Revolutionary War on March 3, 
1770. We will read about Peter Salem 
and Salem Poor at the Battle of Bunker 
Hill, that fired the shot. They said, 
‘‘Don’t fire until you see the whites of 
their eyes.’’ They killed Major Pitcairn, 
who led the Boston Massacre. 

When we hear about the Civil War, 50 
percent of the Navy were African 
Americans, once Frederick Douglass 
convinced President Lincoln to allow 
them. 

In the Spanish-American War, as I 
conclude, we hear about the Rough 
Riders of Teddy Roosevelt, but it was 
the Buffalo Soldiers at the Battle of 
San Juan Hill that saved the Rough 
Riders of Teddy Roosevelt from annihilation, 
which has been kept from our 
history. 

I could go on and on, but since the 
time has expired, at another time I will 
hope to be able to get through World 
War I and World War II and to the 
present time. 

Mr. HONDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H. Res. 272, a resolution offered 
by my fellow Californian Representative BARBARA 
LEE to commemorate the 200th anniversary 
of the elimination of the transatlantic 
slave trade. I commend my colleague for introducing 
the resolution and I am proud to be a 
co-sponsor. 

As Chair and Founder of the Congressional 
Ethiopian American Caucus, I am particularly 
interested in the history of the African Diaspora. 
My experience has taught me that the 
history of the Diaspora is as complex and divergent 
as the communities themselves. Our 
challenge is to educate ourselves about the 
Diaspora and to understand how African 

Americans embrace and explore their heritage. 


To tell the story of African immigration to the 
United States, we have a moral and cultural 
obligation to acknowledge the transatlantic 
slave trade. Today, the House is recognizing 
an important milestone in world history by considering 
H. Res. 272, Commemorating the 
200th Anniversary of the Abolition of the 
Transatlantic Slave Trade. On March 25, 
1807, the transatlantic slave trade was abolished 
by the British Parliament, and the United 
States Government followed suit a year later. 
The transatlantic slave trade was the largest 
forced migration in the world history, and it accounted 
for nearly 12,000,000 people transported 
in bondage from their African homelands 
to the Americas. 

On this day, we pay our respects to those 
who died as a result of slavery, including 
through exposure to the horrors of the Middle 
Passage and in resistance to enslavement. As 
the resolution notes, the slave trade and its 
legacy continue to have a profound impact on 
social and economic disparity, racism and discrimination, 
and continue to affect people of 
African descent today. As a Nation we must 
move beyond telling the story about this crime 
against humanity, to empowering current and 
future generations to take action against the 
political and economic structures that impede 
our social progress. 

I look forward to working with my colleagues 
to develop policies that will repair the damage 
that resulted from the devastating practice of 
transatlantic slave trade, and I urge my colleagues 
to support this resolution commemorating 
its abolition. 

Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I stand before you today in support 
of H. Res. 272, drafted by my colleague Representative 
BARBARA LEE from California. I 
would like to thank her for her leadership on 
this issue in recognition of this important part 
of our shared history. 

This year marks the 200th anniversary of 
the end of the transatlantic slave trade. In 
1807 the United Kingdom outlawed slavery 
recognizing that the African slave trade and all 
manner of dealing and trading in the purchase, 
sale, barter, or transfer of slaves from 
any part of the coast or countries of Africa 
was unlawful and thereby abolished. 

The transatlantic slave trade conducted the 
capture of Africans, mostly from West Africa, 
for the purpose of enslavement in the colonies 
that would become the United States, during 
the 15th and late 19th centuries. 

The Middle Passage was the forced migration 
through overseas transport of millions of 
Africans to the Americas, many of whom suffered 
abuses of rape and perished as a result 
of torture, malnutrition, disease and resistance 
in transit. Those who survived this perilous 
journey were sold into slavery. 

More than 12,000,000 Africans were transported 
in bondage from their African homelands 
to the Americas, and an estimated 
1,200,000 men, women, and children born in 
the Americas were displaced in the forced migration 
that was the domestic slave trade. 

It is important to acknowledge that as a result 
of the slave trade approximately 
80,000,000 to 150,000,000 persons of African 
descent live in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
making them the largest population of 
persons of African descent outside of Africa. 

The transatlantic slave trade is characterized 
as the largest forced migration in world 
history. 

The institution of slavery which enslaved Africans, 
their progeny and later generations for 
life was constitutionally and statutorily sanctioned 
by the Government of the United States 
from 1789 through 1865. 

Slavery in the United States during and after 
British colonial rule included the sale and acquisition 
of Africans as chattel property in 
interstate and intrastate commerce. However 
their presence in southern states posed a 
problem for representation when the Union solidified. 
The Great Compromise of 1787 declared 
that the enslaved Africans would be 
counted as three-fifths of a person for the purposes 
of representation in the House of Representatives 
as not to give undue representation 
to southern states. 

The slavery that flourished in the United 
States constituted an immoral and inhumane 
dispossession of Africans’ life, liberty, and citizenship 
rights and denied them the fruits of 
their own labor. The enslaved Africans in the 
colonies and the United States suffered psychological 
and physical abuse, destruction of 
their culture, language, religion, and families. 

I am disappointed that this body has been 
slow to act on the resolution denouncing slavery 
and offering an official apology to the descendants 
of slaves and the African American 
community. The 2001 World Conference 
against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, 
and Related Intolerance, held in Durban, 
South Africa, declared the slave trade 
and slavery a crime against humanity. The 
world recognizes the magnitude of this atrocity 
so why can’t we make this simple step towards 
reconciliation? 

The slave trade and the legacy of slavery 
continue to have a profound impact on social 
and economic disparity, hatred, bias, racism 
and discrimination in the United States. 

I urge my colleagues to support this and 
other legislation that serves to educate and increase 
awareness of the history of the slave 
trade and its impact on American culture. 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PAYNE) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 272, as amended. 

The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolution, 
as amended, was agreed to. 

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

200th anniversary of the abolition of 
the British slave trade and encouraging

abolition of the institution of slavery, 
and to work for the protection of 
human rights throughout the world, as 
amended. 

The Clerk read the title of the resolution. 


The text of the resolution is as follows: 


H. RES. 158 
Whereas in 1780, William Wilberforce was 
elected at the age of 21 years to the British 
House of Commons; 
Whereas Mr. Wilberforce and his friends 
were active in at least 69 different projects 
focusing on issues such as prison reform, 
education, child labor conditions, animal 
cruelty, and the reformation of the culture; 
Whereas Mr. Wilberforce was mentored and 
counseled by former slave trader and author 
of the hymn ‘‘Amazing Grace’’, John Newton, 
on the horrors of the slave trade; 
Whereas at the time, 11 million human 
beings had been captured and taken from Africa 
to the Western hemisphere and forced 
into slavery and bondage; 
Whereas at the time, the British Empire 
controlled the largest portion of the slave 
trade; 
Whereas Mr. Wilberforce devoted his life to

his fight against the slave trade; 
Whereas Mr. Wilberforce fought for 20 
years in the House of Commons to pass legislation 
banning the slave trade; 
Whereas on February 23, 1807, Britain 
passed a bill banning the slave trade; 
Whereas Mr. Wilberforce helped inspire and 
encourage those who fought against slavery 
in the United States, including political 
leaders like John Quincy Adams, spreading a 
message of hope and freedom throughout 
America and the promise of the future; 
Whereas Mr. Wilberforce labored 46 years 
to abolish the institution of slavery in the 
British Empire, ceaselessly defending those 
without a voice within society; 
Whereas in 1833, Mr. Wilberforce was informed 
on his death bed that the House of 
Commons had voted to abolish slavery;

slave trade, human trafficking, and the degradation 
of human dignity: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 


(1) commends to the people of the United

of those who traffick such individuals; and 
(E) form high school clubs and groups 
working against modern day slavery and the 
trafficking of persons; and 
(3) condemns to the highest degree all 
forms of human trafficking and slavery

resist. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE) and the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. ROS-
LEHTINEN) each will control 20 minutes. 

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of this resolution and 
yield myself such time as I may consume. 


Madam Speaker, I would first like to 
thank Congressman Joe Pitts, who was 
the prime sponsor of this resolution, 
and the other cosponsors. Congressman 
PITTS is a strong human rights activist 
and has worked on issues of Western 
Sahara and other issues dealing with 
suppressed people, and so this resolution 
honoring William Wilberforce by 
Congressman PITTS and encouraging 
young Americans to remember his life, 
legacy and dedication to the abolition 
of the British slave trade. 

Mr. Wilberforce was born in 1759 in 
England into a wealthy merchant family. 
He studied at Cambridge University, 
where he began a lasting friendship 
with the future Prime Minister of 
England, William Pitt. 

In 1780, Wilberforce was elected at 
the age of 21 years of age to the British 
House of Commons. His self-indulgent 
lifestyle as a young man changed completely 
when he became an evangelical 
Christian, prompting him to dedicate 
his life to social reform, particularly 
dealing with the institution of slavery. 

During his time, the British Empire 
controlled the largest portion of the 
slave trade. As we have heard, estimates 
are from 25 to 50 million Africans 
were captured and taken from Africa 
to the Western Hemisphere and 
forced into bondage over centuries. 

Wilberforce was mentored and counseled 
by John Newton, a former slave 
trader and the author of ‘‘Amazing 
Grace,’’ which was a song that John 
Newton wrote when he was caught in a 
storm with slaves. That is when he said 
‘‘Amazing grace, how sweet the 
sound,’’ and he asked the Lord to forgive 
him and he became an Abolitionist. 
That is where this song originated, 
which is still sung at Irish funerals, 
played by the bagpipes, and, of 
course, it opens up many services in 
African American churches throughout 
this country. 

But Mr. Wilberforce talked about the 
horrors of the slave trade and he devoted 
the rest of his life to the suppression 
and the abolition of slavery. In his 

major speech on abolition in the House 
of Commons, he argued that the slave 
trade was morally reprehensible and an 
issue of natural justice. He described in 
vivid details the appalling conditions 
in which slaves traveled from Africa 
through the Middle Passage and argued 
that abolishing the slave trade would 
also bring an improvement in the conditions 
of existing slaves in West Indies, 
then, of course, under the domination 
of Great Britain. 

In addition to his anti-slavery activities, 
Wilberforce was active in at least 
69 different projects, focusing on issues 
such as prison reform, education, child 
labor conditions, animal cruelty, and 
cultural reformation. He was certainly 
a man who was indeed ahead of his 
time. 

Mr. Wilberforce fought for 20 years in 
the House of Commons to pass legislation 
banning the slave trade; and on 
February 23, 1807, Britain passed a bill 
banning slave trade. Wilberforce died 
on the 29th of July, 1833, shortly after 
the act to free slaves passed. He had labored 
for 46 years to abolish slavery in 
the British Empire. 

Wilberforce helped inspire and encourage 
those who fought against slavery 
in the United States, including political 
leaders like John Quincy 
Adams, who actually handled the 
Amistad Case in Connecticut of some 
slaves who in the Caribbean freed 
themselves and ended up on trial, and 
John Quincy Adams won the case. But 
he was influenced by Mr. Wilberforce, 
spreading the message of hope and freedom 
throughout America. 

As a matter of fact, Wilberforce University, 
as we heard Mr. BURTON mention 
earlier, founded in 1856 in Wilberforce, 
Ohio, and the first historically 
black college in the United States of 
America, is part of the honored legacy 
of Wilberforce in the United States. 

b 1515 
Wilberforce University was a final 
destination for the Underground Railroad 
that brought over 100,000 slaves 
from the South to freedom. As a matter 
of fact, currently, the president of 
Wilberforce University is a former 
Member of this body, Reverend Doctor 
Floyd Flake. 
Wilberforce once said, ‘‘Men of authority 
and influence may promote 
good morals. Let them, in their several 
stations, encourage virtue. Let them 
favor and take part in any plans which 
may be formed for the advancement of 
morality.’’ I think those words stand 
today, if we would listen to what Mr. 
Wilberforce said at that time. 
I ask all of you to listen to the words 
of Wilberforce and to vote for this resolution 
to honor Mr. Wilberforce’s work 
and legacy, his commitment to each 
and every person’s human dignity, 
value and freedom. I urge that we pass 
this resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 


H4240 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. PITTS), for introducing 
the bill before us, House Resolution 
158, which observes the 200th anniversary 
of the end of the British slave 
trade and commends the heroic legacy 
of William Wilberforce, the outspoken 
British parliamentarian and Christian 
who was instrumental in its abolition. 

The African slave trade was a heinous 
practice that inflicted degradation 
and misery on those millions of 
people whose human dignity it denied 
or destroyed. 

In celebrating the 200th anniversary 
of Britain’s abolition of the slave 
trade, we cannot help but reflect on the 
tragic fact that it took the United 
States another six decades and a 
wrenching Civil War to do the same, to 
begin living more fully according to 
the principles of our Founding Fathers. 

I commend the author of this resolution, 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. PITTS), for focusing on the challenges 
of the present day, in addition 
to the sins of the past. 

Although the scourge of formalized 
slavery has been eliminated in the west 
and for much, but not all, of the rest of 
the world, millions of women, children 
and men suffer similar severe assaults 
on their dignity and liberty today as 
victims of trafficking, sexual servitude, 
and forced labor. 

This resolution is a welcomed opportunity 
to publicly recommit ourselves 
to the protection of human dignity. In 
the words of the man whom we honor 
in our resolution, William Wilberforce, 
he said, ‘‘Let us act with an energy 
suited to the importance of the interests 
for which we contend, stimulated 
by a consciousness of what we owe to 
the laws of God and the rights and happiness 
of man.’’ 

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. PITTS) be allowed to control 
the remainder of our time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentlewoman 
from Florida? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

I thank the gentlewoman from Florida 
(Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN) for yielding 
and for her principled leadership on the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, and I 
thank the gentleman from New Jersey 
(Mr. PAYNE) for his leadership on this 
and the preceding resolution, and for 
his leadership on the issue of human 
rights in general around the world. 

Madam Speaker, with this resolution, 
we rightly honor one of humanity’s 
great heroes. William Wilberforce 
was a man of integrity, a man of courage, 
a man of faith, and a man of principle. 
And he used these qualities, 
Madam Speaker, to forever change the 
world for the better. He is someone 
that each of us in this Chamber can relate 
to and draw inspiration from. 

In a legislative body of 435 Members, 
it can be difficult to make progress on 

the issues we care about. Indeed, the 
odds sometimes appear insurmountable. 


But the life and accomplishments of 
William Wilberforce are proof that individuals 
of character truly can change 
the world. Wilberforce was himself a 
member of an elected legislative body. 
He was first elected to the British Parliament 
more than 220 years ago. 

In his day, the human slave trade 
dominated England’s economy. As a result, 
the interests of the slave traders 
were firmly entrenched in the halls of 
Parliament. Arguments used to justify 
the sale and trade of human beings and 
the horrific injustices that occurred in 
that trade were commonplace in that 
day. 

But William Wilberforce refused to 
accept these arguments. He knew that 
slavery was an unspeakable injustice, 
and he made it his object to end it. 
This conviction would lead him on a 
decades-long effort to end slavery in 
England. It was a journey full of setbacks 
and disappointments. Again and 
again, he introduced his bill in parliament 
to end the British slave trade. 
Again and again it was soundly defeated, 
and again and again he was ostracized 
by his peers. For years this 
went on, and the discouragement grew. 

But all the while, Wilberforce’s call 
to conscience was slowly winning over 
hearts and minds. His willingness to 
stand for what was right and fight 
what was wrong was being noticed by 
his colleagues. And after 20 years of 
perseverance, 20 years of unbending 
principle, 20 years of standing for justice 
in the face of daunting odds, Wilberforce 
at last tasted success. 

On February 23, 1807, Parliament 
voted, and on March 25, the King 
signed the bill that outlawed the British 
slave trade, a move that was once 
thought impossible. 

And 26 years later, Wilberforce was 
informed a few days before his death 
that the House of Commons had finally 
voted to abolish slavery altogether in 
the British Empire. 

Madam Speaker, throughout this 
year, we celebrate the 200th anniversary 
of this tremendous accomplishment. 
And as part of this celebration, a 
number of efforts are underway to inform 
people of this often-forgotten 
hero of humanity and his colleagues 
who worked to end in slavery. 

We could mention others, like John 
Newton, who has already been mentioned. 
John Newton was a former 
slave trader who wrote the hymn 
‘‘Amazing Grace,’’ whose testimony before 
Parliament was so influential. 

We could mention John Wesley, who 
a week before he died in 1791, wrote 
William Wilberforce about American 
slavery which he called ‘‘the vilest 
form of slavery known to mankind.’’ 

We could mention Wilberforce’s direct 
influence on John Quincy Adams, 
and John Quincy Adams’ direct influence 
on Abraham Lincoln. There are 
many people who could be mentioned, 
but this resolution before us today is 

part of the celebration of the life and 
accomplishments of William Wilberforce, 
and are certainly worthy of recognition. 


Madam Speaker, I would submit this 
is not merely an effort to look back 
and give credit where credit is due, it is 
also a call to fight modern-day injustice. 


Sadly, every generation must confront 
evil in its own time, and ours is 
no different. Around the world, thousands 
of people are deprived of their 
basic human rights every single day. 
Good men and women of this world 
have a moral duty to fight these mod-
ern-day injustices. 

The U.S. State Department estimates 
that approximately 800,000 men, women 
and children are trafficked each year 
into slavery, into the sex industry, 
other slave-like labor conditions. 

In South Asia, an entire class of people 
numbering in the millions are considered 
to be ‘‘untouchable,’’ and as a 
result, they are denied basic services 
and subjected to terrible living conditions. 
Horrible human rights abuses 
continue in places like Burma and 
Sudan and China and many others. 
These are just a few examples. The list 
could go on. 

Madam Speaker, as we honor William 
Wilberforce, may we also be inspired 
today to educate ourselves and others 
about modern-day injustice, inspired to 
not turn a blind eye to millions of people 
worldwide who need our help; and 
inspired, Madam Speaker, to act. 

I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this important resolution. 

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, we 
have one additional speaker who has 
not yet arrived, so I reserve the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to yield 6 minutes to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), 
the former chairman, current ranking 
member, of the Subcommittee on Africa 
and Global Health and a great champion 
of human rights today. 

Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. 
PITTS of Pennsylvania, for authoring 
this important resolution recognizing 
the abolishment of the inhumane, 
grossly immoral and ubiquitous British 
slave trade 200 years ago, and the highly 
principled member of the House of 
Commons, William Wilberforce, who 
poured his life into that noble cause. 
One man can—and did—make a difference. 


H. Res. 158 also links the abolition 
issue to today’s modern-day slave 
trade, human trafficking, and I appreciate 
that the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
recognized that there are lessons 
learned that need to be applied to 
our current battle against modern-day 
slavery. 
Madam Speaker, William Wilberforce 
was 21 years old when he was elected to 
the House of Commons in 1780. And perhaps 
like some of us, later said, ‘‘The 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4241 

first years in Parliament I did nothing, 
nothing to any purpose. My own distinction 
was my darling object.’’ 

But that all changed, Madam Speaker, 
after a profound conversion to 
Christianity and a serious rethinking 
as to whether politics, with all of its 
diversions, distractions, vanity, lies, 
and deception, was compatible with his 
ever-deepening religious faith. He even 
thought of quitting politics and entering 
into a ministry. 

John Newton, the former slave captain 
turned convert to Christ, among 
others, encouraged him to fight the 
battle against slavery where it could be 
won, in Parliament. The Commons is 
the place where you can stop slavery. 
Wilberforce agreed, and then poured his 
life into that battle. 

William Wilberforce once said: 
‘‘Never, never will we desist until we 
extinguish every trace of this bloody 
traffic to which our posterity, looking 
back to the history of these enlightened 
times, will scarce believe that it 
has been suffered to exist so long to 
disgrace and dishonor this country.’’ 

He also said: ‘‘So enormous, so dreadful, 
so remediable did the trade’s wickedness 
quickly appear that my own 
mind was completely made up for its 
abolition.’’ 

Madam Speaker, 200 years ago the 
slave trade was abolished, and he went 
on for the rest of his life with a group 
of prayer warriors, men and women 
who prayed every day for the abolishment 
of the slave trade, who believed it 
was a blight not just against man and 
woman, but against God himself. And 
it was through prayer and action that 
they came up with a number of very interesting 
and creative legislative ways 
of trying to stop it. 

Wilberforce was also tenacious. Time 
and time again, he would offer his bill 
to abolish the slave trade, only to have 
all kinds of shenanigans, filibusters 
and misinformation, diversions, and 
threats including physical threats to 
himself, used as a way of deferring action, 
but he nevertheless persisted and 
in the end, he prevailed. 

We need to learn from that example, 
Madam Speaker, because we have a 
slave trade today. In 1990s, the phenomenon 
of human trafficking, ever 
present in all of history, exploded in 
prevalence, sophistication and cruelty. 

With the breakup of the Soviet Union 
and the Warsaw Pact nations, suddenly 
new mobsters, many of them former 
KBG operatives, were all of a sudden on 
the scene buying and selling young 
women as commodities. 

Additionally, the Internet suddenly 
brought pornography, including child 
porn, into homes all over the world, 
furthering the demand for victims. The 
sleazy X-rated theater went mainstream. 


Organized crime in countries all over 
the world, including the United States, 
made profits seemingly without limit 
while incurring next to no risk of prosecution. 


As Mr. PITTS pointed out earlier, 
today the United States is the net im


porter of upwards of 18,000 people, 
mostly women or children, who are 
trafficked into this country to be exploited. 
That is an abomination. 

We also have our own interstate 
slave trade where young girls who are 
runaways are quickly picked up by 
pimps and bought and sold like commodities. 
That, too, must stop. 

b 1530 
Madam Speaker, I believe that because 
too much evil is involved here 
and because the prospect of making 
billions of dollars has enticed some of 
the most unsavory and cruel individuals, 
including and especially organized 
crime, into this nefarious trade 
we have to beef up our efforts to stop 
this slavery. Because too much demand 
enabled by crass indifference, unbridled 
hedonism and misogynistic attitudes 
has turned people, especially women, 
into objects valued only for their utility 
in the brothel or in the sweat shop 
we have to accelerate and expand our 
fight, and because of the relative lack 
of visibility, all of this makes the task 
of combating trafficking in modern day 
slavery all the more difficult. 
But trafficking, like germs, infection 
and disease, thrives only in the shadows 
and in the murky places and cannot 
survive when brought to the light. 
Light remains a very, very powerful 
disinfectant. 
So my challenge to all of us is that 
we have to bring the light, the bright 
light of scrutiny, of criminal investigations, 
the disinfecting of investigations 
and convictions, probing legislative inquiry, 
having the students, as Mr. 
PITTS in this bill encourages them to 
do, to form student groups to look into 
slavery. We need to use every tool, best 
practice and well-honed strategy to 
win the freedom of the slaves and to 
spare others the agony, especially 
through prevention measures, the 
agony of slavery. 
Together, we can make the pimps 
and the exploiters pay by doing serious 
jail time, as well as the forfeiture of 
their assets. The boats, the villas and 
the fat-cat bank accounts must go. Together 
we can end this barbaric and utterly 
cruel modern day slavery, just as 
William Wilberforce and other great 
men and women did so in antiquity. 
Make no mistake about it; the abolition 
of modern day slavery is a winnable 
war. We need to fight in ways so 
as to win. We need to pray. I believe we 
need to fast, and we need to have good, 
well-developed strategies, and we need 
to work as a bipartisan team, to end 
this cruelty. 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LEE), a member of the 
Appropriations Committee. 
Ms. LEE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
again Mr. PAYNE for yielding. 
Let me commend Mr. PITTS and all 
those who have cosponsored this resolution, 
and say how important it is 
today for us to be discussing this in a 
bipartisan way and commending and 
remembering Mr. Wilberforce. 

This resolution talks about how he 
devoted his life to the suppression and 
abolition of the institution of slavery, 
but it also calls upon the youth of the 
United States, especially, to form clubs 
and groups dedicated to working 
against modern slave trade and human 
trafficking and the degradation of 
human dignity. 

Also it calls on the reflection of Mr. 
Wilberforce’s selfless dedication to 
fight against slavery and his commitment 
to the neediest in society. I think 
we should today remind ourselves that 
we need to rededicate ourselves to the 
principles and values which Mr. Wilberforce 
demonstrated through his life. 

Let me give you some examples of 
how we really can do this today. When 
you look at this budget and the appropriations 
process, we are talking about 
cutting programs such as GEAR UP 
and TRIO that really help our youth, 
especially our African American and 
Latino youth, receive an education 
that allows them a level playing field. 

When you look at California, affirmative 
action ended. We have very few 
students entering into the University 
of California, very few African American 
and Latino businesses because we 
have ended equal opportunity efforts in 
California, very few people of color employed 
by the State of California. And 
why? Because they did not adhere to 
Mr. Wilberforce’s ideals and his principles. 


When you look at the prison population 
and the disparities, when you 
look at African American young men 
and women, the huge disparities in the 
prison populations, huge disparities in 
the dropout rate. Why? You have to understand, 
and I think this resolution, 
as minded, talks about the vestiges and 
the legacy of slavery; and so in rededicating 
ourselves to end this, we need to 
do what we can do today and close 
these disparities and make the right, 
correct budget decisions as we look at 
these budgets that we are putting together. 


Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, we have 
no additional speakers; therefore, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
as much time as he may consume to 
the Representative from the 14th District 
of Michigan (Mr. CONYERS), chairman 
of the Judiciary Committee and 
dean of the Congressional Black Caucus. 


Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to join in this discussion to congratulate 
my colleague from New Jersey 
DON PAYNE and my dear friend who 
brought this to my attention only yesterday 
from California (Ms. LEE). I am 
so pleased to hear this discussion going 
on commemorating the 200th anniversary 
of the abolition of the transatlantic 
slave trade, but also the recognition 
of William Wilberforce, after 
whom the famous African American 
university, Wilberforce, was named, a 
distinguished member of the British 
House of Commons. 

What we are discussing here is not 
just ancient history. It is not just a 


H4242 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

recollection of why we have a 13th 
amendment to the Constitution prohibiting 
slavery. But we are talking about 
one of the great iniquities of our civilization. 
Slavery has always been a problem 
that we have dealt with across our 
centuries; but today and in countries 
all over the world, we are beginning to 
examine where it goes. 

We heard the distinguished gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) 
recite present problems. We have heard 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
LEE) talk about things that lead us 
into conditions of such abject poverty 
that people are made vulnerable to the 
whole question of being subjugated and 
eventually so impoverished that they 
end up being oppressed or exploited. 

We know that many are still being 
trapped in trying to leave one country 
to improve their economic conditions, 
and they end up under false pretences 
in a forced work circumstance. Frequently, 
it’s prostitution for young 
women. And for this 110th Congress, 
with these resolutions, H. Res. 272 and 

H. Res. 158, are now beginning to deal 
with this subject, not only in the 
present circumstance but examining 
the roots and the origins of this obnoxious, 
inhumane, indescribably evil circumstance 
in which we find men, 
women and children still under such 
oppression today. 
For that reason, I am proud to stand 
here as the chairman of the committee 
that has jurisdiction over our constitutional 
amendments and to join with 
the distinguished members of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee who recognize 
that after many unsuccessful attempts, 
the British Parliament finally abandoned 
and made slavery illegal, but finally, 
after a great deal of effort were 
able to stop it. It didn’t stop because 
we passed a law. Slavery and second-
class citizenship and the denial of the 
rights of Americans didn’t stop because 
we passed the 13th amendment. It 
didn’t even stop after we passed a series 
of Voting Rights Acts to enforce 
the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments. 

So here we are today, again recommitting 
this Nation through the people’s 
House to make certain that everyone 
understands how this came about, 
how the Atlantic slave trade was so 
evil and that its legacy lingers over 
this Nation today. 

I congratulate all of the leaders of 
these two measures and in commemorating 
the legacy and remembering 
this great Parliamentarian from England, 
William Wilberforce. Many of our 
predecessors worked, as tirelessly as 
we do, through the last couple centuries 
to deliver on the simple promise 
of freedom; but guess what, it doesn’t 
turn on us just keeping people free. A 
free people have to become educated. 
They have to work. They have to raise 
their family. We have to put this enormously 
important consideration into 
the context of what it means. 

To be free is not free. To be free 
means that you can get educated to 
compete in a computerized technology. 

It means to be able to be healthy and 
to live and grow to make everyone 
have this wonderful opportunity. It 
was said so then to every man and 
woman and child the chance, the 
chance, the gold shining opportunity to 
become whatever they could in the 
course of one’s life. 

We celebrated the life yesterday of 
our dearest colleague Juanita 
Millender-McDonald as she was memorialized 
in Los Angeles. What a dynamic, 
unusual, amazing circumstance 
of a young girl from Alabama transporting 
herself to the first elected 
chairwoman of color of the House Administration 
Committee. 

These are the kinds of opportunities 
that are open to us, to the 43 members 
of the Congressional Black Caucus, 
who all have equally poignant stories. 
We have an African American chairman 
who had to join the Army because 
he could not get a job. That is existing 
today. 

It is in that spirit of looking back 
and yet confronting the realities that I 
am so proud to join my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle who have made 
this an important day to remember, to 
reflect on and to plan how we move the 
condition and the plight of all 300 million 
of our citizens forward. 

I thank the gentleman from New Jersey 
for yielding me this time. 

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

Let me conclude once again by 
thanking the prime sponsor, Congressman 
PITTS, for this resolution and just 
say that as I was indicating before 
about a little bit about our history, it 
is important that we remember history. 
It is important that the House of 
Commons fought and Mr. Wilberforce 
would not give up his fight. 

Actually, New Jersey back in 1863 
passed the 13th amendment that was 
proposed by President Lincoln, although 
New Jersey did not support 
Lincoln in his elections. The Republicans 
passed the 13th amendment, but 
interestingly enough, the Democrats 
opposed this, and in the next election 
the Democrats swept out all the Republicans 
in the New Jersey State legislature 
and actually rescinded the 13th 
amendment. 

b 1545 
So New Jersey did not pass the 13th 
amendment, refused to take up the debate 
on the 14th or 15th amendments. 
There was a time in our State where 
we were called, rather than down south 
was called up north or down north, because 
we did have problems, even in 
the North, attempting to get basic 
things like 13th amendment abolishing 
slavery; 14th amendment, due process 
under the law; and 15th amendment, 
giving the right to vote to all citizens. 
We still have to fight injustice. No 
one would think that our great Garden 
State, which today is such a leader in 
the right things, had such a spotted 
past and a troubled history. 
I urge support of this resolution. 

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PAYNE) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 158, as amended. 

The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolution, 
as amended, was agreed to. 

The title was amended so as to read: 
‘‘Resolution encouraging the people of 
the United States, particularly the 
youth of the United States, to observe 
the 200th anniversary of the abolition 
of the British slave trade and remember 
the life and legacy of William Wilberforce, 
a member of the British 
House of Commons who devoted his life 
to the suppression and abolition of the 
institution of slavery, and to work for 
the protection of human rights 
throughout the world’’. 

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

EXPRESSING SYMPATHY TO FAMI


LIES OF WOMEN AND GIRLS 

MURDERED IN GUATEMALA 

Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 100) expressing the 
sympathy of the House of Representatives 
to the families of women and girls 
murdered in Guatemala and encouraging 
the Government of Guatemala to 
bring an end to these crimes. 

The Clerk read the title of the resolution. 
The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. RES. 100 
Whereas Guatemalan women were among 
the victims during the 36-year Guatemalan 
internal armed conflict which ended with the 
signing of the 1996 Peace Accords and ushered 
in the process of reconciliation; 
Whereas since 2001, more than 2,000 women 
and girls have been murdered in Guatemala 
often preceded by abduction, sexual assault, 
or brutal mutilation; 
Whereas from 2001 to 2006, the rate at 
which women and girls have been murdered 
in Guatemala has increased sharply, at a 
higher rate than the murder rate of men in 
Guatemala during the same period; 
Whereas the number of murders of Guatemalan 
women and girls has increased significantly 
from 303 in 2001 to more than 500 in 
2006; 
Whereas, according to reports from Guatemalan 
officials, most of the victims are 
women ranging in age from 18 to 30 and 
many were abducted in broad daylight in 
well-populated areas; 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4243 

Whereas the manner and rate of murders of 
Guatemalan women and girls suggests an increase 
in gender based killings, an extreme 
form of violence against women that can include 
torture, mutilation, and sexual violence; 


Whereas, according to data from Guatemala’s 
Public Prosecutors Office, few arrests 
and fewer convictions have taken place, 
leading to accusations that police, prosecutors, 
forensics experts, and other state justice 
officials have not brought the perpetrators 
to justice; 

Whereas inadequate financial, human, and 
technical resources, as well as a lack of forensic 
and technical expertise, has complicated 
the arrest and prosecution of suspects; 


Whereas the Guatemalan Human Rights 
Ombudsman reports that on ten separate occasions 
police officers have been implicated 
in the murder of Guatemalan women and 
girls and recommends that such officers and 
other officials be held accountable for their 
acts; 

Whereas the Guatemalan Special Prosecutor 
for Crimes Against Women, in her 
statements regarding the Guatemalan murder 
cases, reported that her office has reviewed 
approximately 800 reports of domestic 
violence per month, with some of those 
cases ending in murder; 

Whereas the Government of Guatemala has 
undertaken efforts to prevent violence 
against women, as evidenced by its ratification 
of the United Nations Convention 
Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the 
United Nations Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination 
Against Women, the Convention of Belem do 
Para, and other international human rights 
treaties, and the enactment of laws and the 
creation of state institutions to promote and 
protect the rights of women; 

Whereas, in June 2006, the Government of 
Guatemala successfully abolished the ‘‘Rape 
Law’’ which had absolved perpetrators of 
criminal responsibility for rape and certain 
other crimes of violence upon the perpetrator’s 
marriage with the victim; 

Whereas the Government of Guatemala has 
created special police and prosecutorial 
units to address the brutal murders of Guatemalan 
women and girls; 

Whereas Guatemalan legislators from various 
parties have joined lawmakers from 
Mexico and Spain to form the Inter-
parliamentary Network against ‘‘Femicide’’; 

Whereas the Government of Guatemala 
and the United Nations recently signed an 
agreement to establish the International 
Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala 
(CICIG), which has a mandate to investigate 
and promote prosecution of illegal security 
groups and clandestine security organizations 
that function with impunity and are 
suspected of attacking human rights defenders, 
and other crimes that have undermined 
overall security in Guatemala; 

Whereas murders of Guatemalan women 
and girls have brought pain to the families 
and friends of the victims as they struggle to 
cope with the loss of their loved ones and the 
fact that the perpetrators of these heinous 
acts remain unknown to the proper authorities; 
and 

Whereas continuing impunity for the crime 
of murder is a threat to the rule of law, democracy, 
and stability in Guatemala: Now, 
therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 


(1) expresses its sincerest condolences and 
deepest sympathy to the families of women 
and girls murdered in Guatemala; 
(2) expresses the solidarity of the people of 
the United States with the people of Guatemala 
in the face of these tragic and senseless 
acts; 

(3) condemns the ongoing abductions and 
murders of women and girls in Guatemala 
which have been occurring with increasing 
brutality and frequency; 
(4) recognizes the courageous struggle of 
the victims’ families in seeking justice for 
the victims; 
(5) urges the Government of Guatemala to 
recognize domestic violence and sexual harassment 
as criminal acts; 
(6) encourages the Government of Guatemala 
to act with due diligence in order to investigate 
promptly the killings of women 
and girls, prosecute those responsible, and 
eliminate the tolerance of violence against 
women; 
(7) supports efforts to identify perpetrators 
and unknown victims through forensic analysis, 
including DNA testing, such as the National 
Institute for Forensic Science in Guatemala 
(INACIF) and encourages such efforts 
to be conducted by independent, impartial 
experts; 
(8) urges the President and Secretary of 
State to continue to express support for the 
efforts of the victims’ families and loved 
ones to seek justice for the victims, to express 
concern relating to the continued harassment 
of these families and the human 
rights defenders with whom they work, and 
to express concern with respect to impediments 
in the ability of the families to receive 
prompt and accurate information in 
their cases; 
(9) encourages the Secretary of State to 
urge the Government of Guatemala to honor 
and dignify the victims of the brutal murders 
and to continue to include in the Department 
of State’s annual Country Reports 
on Human Rights Practices all instances of 
improper investigatory methods, threats 
against human rights activists, and the use 
of torture with respect to cases involving the 
murder and abduction of women and girls in 
Guatemala; 
(10) encourages the Secretary of State to 
urge the Government of Guatemala to hold 
accountable those law enforcement and judicial 
officials whose failure to investigate and 
prosecute the murders adequately, whether 
through negligence, omission, or abuse, has 
led to impunity for these crimes; 
(11) encourages the Secretary of State to 
support and urge the Government of Guatemala 
to take measures to ensure that the 
special Guatemalan police and prosecutorial 
units have an adequate number of appropriately 
trained personnel with sufficient resources 
to conduct thorough and proper investigations 
and prosecutions that reflect 
the gravity and magnitude of this national 
security crisis; 
(12) recommends that the United States 
Ambassador to Guatemala continue to meet 
with the families of the victims, women’s 
rights organizations, and Guatemalan officials 
responsible for investigating these 
crimes and preventing such future crimes; 
and 
(13) recommends that the Secretary of 
State develop a comprehensive plan to address 
and combat the growing problem of violence 
against women in Latin America. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) and the gentleman 
from Indiana (Mr. BURTON) 
each will control 20 minutes. 

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 

and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the resolution 
under consideration. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from New Jersey? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself as much time as I may consume. 


Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this resolution. I want to thank 
our colleague, Congresswoman HILDA 
SOLIS, the sponsor of this resolution, as 
well as original cosponsors, the Chair 
and the ranking member of the Western 
Hemisphere Subcommittee, ELIOT 
ENGEL and DAN BURTON, for bringing 
this issue to us. 

This important resolution raises 
awareness of the increasing number of 
women and girls who have been brutally 
murdered in Guatemala. Since 
2001, more than 2,000 women and girls 
have been killed in Guatemala, and the 
murder rate of women has increased 
sharply, more so than the rate for men. 

Many of these murders are preceded 
by mutilation or sexual assault of the 
victims, and almost none of these cases 
are properly investigated or prosecuted. 
The fact that most of the murders 
go unpunished has contributed to 
the decline of overall security in Guatemala 
and demonstrates the dangerous 
situation for women and girls 
throughout the country. 

While Guatemala has made some 
strides to improve the treatment of 
women under the law, there are still 
major obstacles for the country to 
overcome. For instance, domestic violence 
and sexual harassment are not 
considered crimes in Guatemala. This 
resolution condemns the murders, expresses 
sympathy and support for the 
struggle of victims’ families for justice 
and urges that the murders be promptly 
investigated and prosecuted. 

I hope that our two countries can 
work together to end the brutal murders 
of women and girls in Guatemala 
and to improve the security for all 
Guatemalans. I urge all my colleagues 
to support H. Res. 100. 

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
might consume. 

First of all, I want to congratulate 
Representative SOLIS for introducing 
this bill. She and I have worked together 
on it, and I really appreciate her 
hard work. She is really concerned 
about the rights of women around the 
world and not just Guatemala. I appreciate 
that. 

Let me start out by saying today we 
have heard a great deal about human 
rights violation, slavery and other 
issues. The problem is not confined just 
to one part of the world. In China 
today, as Representative SMITH of New 
Jersey has pointed out many times, 
there are as many as 10 million people 
suffering in communist gulags, and 
other parts of the world. In the Sudan, 


H4244 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

we see the oppression and the horrible 
atrocities that are taking place and the 
mistreatment of not only men and 
women but children as well. It’s just a 
horrible thing that we see these kinds 
of atrocities taking place around the 
world. 

I really appreciate my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle working so hard 
to focus attention on what’s going on 
in these various areas to try to bring 
them to a halt. For humanity’s sake, 
we can do no less. 

I, however, today, rise in support of 

H. Res. 100, which recognizes and honors 
the women and girls who have been 
murdered in Guatemala. This bill 
brings to light the problem women in 
the democratic nation of Guatemala 
face in their daily struggle for survival. 
Given the current environment in Guatemala, 
women are not safe to walk 
along the streets day or night. A simple 
walk from home or school or work 
to mean abduction, mutilation or 
death for a Guatemalan woman or girl. 
Given the lack of legislative protection 
and judicial investigation, women are 
often subjected to domestic abuse, 
often leading to death within the home 
as well. 
Given that there is nowhere for these 
victims or their families to turn, over 
2,000, as has been said to my colleague, 
over 2,000 Guatemalan women and girls 
have suffered horrendous deaths in the 
past 5 years. Tremendous efforts have 
been taken by some Guatemalan legislators 
and human rights workers and 
families of the victims. They come 
here to Washington to try to end such 
atrocities by focusing attention on 
them. 

There has been a continuous rise, 
however, in the brutal female deaths. 
There can be no rest of the weary as 
long as these things go on. We must 
come together to assist their effort and 
urge the government of Guatemala to 
take quick deliberative action to investigate 
the killings and prosecute those 
responsible and eliminate the tolerance, 
the tolerance of violence against 
women. 

The women in Guatemala deserve to 
experience peace and prosperity within 
their nation and not constant fear of 
sexual assault and deadly mutilation, 
in just walking to and from work, as I 
said before. 

I ask my colleagues to see the urgency 
of this bill, and to support it. 
Once again, Representative SOLIS, 
thanks for your hard work. 

Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentlelady from California 
(Ms. SOLIS). 

Ms. SOLIS. I would like to thank the 
gentleman and also take this time to 
acknowledge the support of Chairman 
LANTOS, Subcommittee Chairman 
ENGEL, Subcommittee Ranking Member 
BURTON, who is here, and Congresswoman 
BARBARA LEE, who are the 
original cosponsors of House Resolution 
100, for their tireless work on this 

issue. I urge all my colleagues to support 
this bipartisan resolution. 

Madam Speaker, I know that we have 
heard much this afternoon about this 
predicament that exists in Guatemala. 
It has been going on for many, many 
years. This resolution that I introduced 
earlier this year would acknowledge 
the murders of 2,500 or more 
young women and girls that have been 

mutilated, attacked, assaulted and 
killed in Guatemala. 
The murder rate for women and 

young women continues to rise there. 
It’s as though there’s a blind eye on the 
part of the government in Guatemala, 
as well as ours. That is why I brought 
this measure to the floor here. I think 
it is important that when a crime 
against a woman is done in any part 
the world, it’s a crime against all of us 
and humanity. 

Therefore, I want to acknowledge the 
support of our colleagues, and especially 
for the hard work of the advocates, 
the groups that actually help to 
bring this issue before the Congress. 
They could have, at any time in the 
past 10 years, come and spoken to any 
Member of Congress about the issue. 
But the time wasn’t right. Perhaps the 
politics, the environment, just wasn’t 
fit for that. But now that we have seen 
resolutions come out of this House, 
where we worked on a bipartisan basis 
to deal with the issues of the women of 
Ciudad Juarez, and now we bring forward 
this issue. 

Now we have more support on both 
sides of the aisle to say that the violence 
has to stop. There must not be 
impunity. Everyone should be held accountable. 
There needs to be transparency 
in government on the part of 
the Guatemalan Government, and on 
the part of our government as well, 
provide technical support, and also 
help to seek some resolution to the violence 
against these women that continues 
to go on. 

I want to thank those groups that especially 
have worked hard with us to 
combat this particular crime. I would 
like to mention their names, Amnesty 
International, the Washington Office 
on Latin America, the Guatemala 
Human Rights Commission, Human 
Rights First, and, also, a group from 
my home area, CARECEN, the Central 
American Resource Center advocacy 
group based in Los Angeles. 

They are strong supporters of House 
Resolution 100. Did you know, in fact, 
in the City of Los Angeles, this has one 
of the highest concentrations of Guatemalans. 
So many of them know distinctly 
how important this resolution 
is. They thank the Congress for bringing 
up this measure. 

Madam Speaker, I include for the 
RECORD letters from CARECEN and 20 
other advocacy groups that are also in 
support of this resolution. 

DEAR CONGRESSMEMBER: we write to urge 
your support for H. Res. 100, which expresses 
sympathy to the families of women and girls 
murdered in Guatemala and encourages the 
Government of Guatemala to bring an end to 
these crimes. 

Historically, the U.S. has offered asylum 
to those fleeing persecution based on race, 
religion, political opinion, national origin or 
membership in a particular social group. 
Only in the past decade have women and 
girls fleeing gender-based persecution (such 
as domestic violence, female genital cutting, 
human trafficking, ‘‘honor’’ killings, etc.) 
been recognized as refugees, but this remains 
an issue that is still widely debated. 

There is no doubt that asylum is a life-saving 
form of protection, and recognition of 
gender-based claims is an important statement 
by the U.S. that it takes women’s 
rights seriously. But asylum cannot be a solution 
to the underlying human rights problem. 
By definition, asylum seekers are forced 
to flee their home countries in order to save 
their lives and to escape persecution, but 
they leave behind many others who face the 
very same violations of their fundamental 
human rights—and who have no protection 
at all. Therefore, if we truly seek to address 
the problem at its source, we must examine 
the ‘‘root causes’’ of the violence and persecution 
that are forcing asylum seekers to 
flee in the first place. The story of Rodi Alvarado 
and Guatemala’s femicides serve as a 
tragic case in point. 

For more than a decade, Rodi Alvarado 
was brutalized by her husband, a former soldier 
in the Guatemalan military, and her repeated 
and desperate pleas for help from the 
police and courts were ignored. Ultimately, 
she had no other option but to flee for her 
life. Rodi’s case—known as Matter of R.A.— 
has been pending for almost ten years, and 
although two successive Attorneys General— 
Janet Reno and John Ashcroft—‘‘certified’’ 
the case to themselves, neither of them 
issued a definitive decision. In 2001, the immigration 
agency proposed regulations clarifying 
that domestic violence and other related 
harms could form the basis of an asylum 
claim. However, those regulations have 
yet to be finalized, and the lives of women 
like Rodi Alvarado, who have sought asylum 
in the U.S., continue to hang in the balance. 

We ask you to strongly urge Attorney General 
Gonzales and Department of Homeland 
Security Secretary Chertoff to issue regulations 
which would clearly recognize that 
women in circumstances such as Rodi Alvarado 
qualify for protection as refugees. This 
would send a clear message that women and 
girls fleeing gender-persecution will find a 
safe haven in the U.S. 

Advancing protective U.S. asylum law is 
critical, but equally important is addressing 
the root causes that force women to flee 
their home countries. In Rodi Alvarado’s 
case, these causes are an epidemic of violence 
against Guatemalan women; more than 
3,000 women and girls have been murdered 
since 2000. These gender-motivated killings 
or ‘‘femicides’’ are notable both for their 
brutality and for the virtual impunity of 
those responsible. The most recent available 
statistics reveal the abysmal failure of the 
Guatemalan government to effectively investigate, 
prosecute, and punish those who 
carry out these horrific crimes. Only 17 murders 
of women—of the thousands that have 
been committed—have been prosecuted. 

Guatemala’s femicides demonstrate the 
lack of any meaningful protection for women 
like Rodi Alvarado, who are left with no 
other choice than to flee for their lives. Unless 
and until the Guatemalan government 
reforms its justice system such that there is 
an end to impunity that exists for those who 
commit this violence, hundreds more women 
will lose their lives, while others will be 
forced to flee in order to save them. 

As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, 
we ask you to play a critical 
role in resolving the root causes of gender-

hemisphere, because not only are we 
looking at setting a standard here, but 
we are letting people know that we are 
on watch, and that America will take 
their place, as we always have, in providing 
leadership. 

I thank our chairperson for this committee. 
I thank the gentleman. I thank 
our ranking member on the other side 
of the aisle and all of those groups that 
helped to support this resolution. 

Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlelady from California 
(Ms. WOOLSEY), a member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee. 

Ms. WOOLSEY. I would like to thank 
my colleague from California (Ms. 
SOLIS) for introducing this bill. I would 
like to thank Chairman LANTOS for 
working to bring it to the floor as 
quickly as he did. 

Madam Speaker, one of the top priorities 
of this 110th Congress has been to 
protect women’s rights and to prevent 
violence against them. That is why I 
am particularly proud to be a cosponsor 
of this resolution, H. Res. 100, a resolution 
that brings the same kind of 
commitment to the women and girls of 
Guatemala. The supporters of H. Res. 
100 are speaking loudly against the systematic 
abuse and sexual violence that 
the women and girls of Guatemala face. 

Since the year 2001, 2,000 women and 
girls have been murdered. We are saying 
that it’s beyond time for the Guatemalan 
government to stand up 
against these inexcusable and inhumane 
acts. They are acts of violence, 
and they must punish the offenders. We 
want them to put the resources necessary 
toward providing for investigations 
and for DNA testing. 

Today, with this resolution, this Congress 
stands up and offers more than 
our condolences. We offer our support. 
We stand with the women and the girls 
of Guatemala, and we pledge to bring 

safety and justice to them. We want 
their government to work with us to 
that end. 

Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey’s 10th Congressional District, 
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee 
on Africa and Global 
Health, my good friend DON PAYNE. 

b 1600 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, let me 
thank the prime sponsor, Ms. SOLIS, for 
introducing this very important House 
Resolution 100, expressing the sympathy 
of the House of Representatives 
to the families of women and girls murdered 
in Guatemala, and encouraging 
the Government of Guatemala to bring 
an end to these crimes. 
Let me commend Ms. SOLIS from 
California, not only for the women in 
Guatemala but she has actually expressed 
concerns for the deaths of 
women in Mexico. We have had discussions 
with Ms. SOLIS about the murders 
on the border of the United States and 
Mexico where women have been killed 
and there are a tremendous number of 
unsolved crimes there, and she visited 
that community in Mexico to express 
our concern for the women of that region 
and that country. So this is simply 
an extension of the work that she 
has done so well on behalf of women 
not only here in this country but 
throughout the world. 
As we know, since 2001 more than 
2,000 women and girls have been murdered 
in Guatemala, often preceded by 
abductions, sexual assault, or brutal 
mutilation. The murder rate has continued 
to increase and has grown from 
2001 where there were 303 reported to 
more than 500 in 2006. And so we have 
asked the Government of Guatemala 
and actually the United Nations, and 
they recently signed an agreement to 
establish the International Commission 
Against Impunity in Guatemala, 
which has a mandate to investigate 
and promote prosecution of illegal security 
groups and clandestine security 
organizations that function with impunity 
and are suspected of attacking 
human rights defenders and other 
crimes that have undermined the overall 
security in Guatemala. 
So when we look to Guatemala and 
we express our sincerest condolences to 
the families of these women and girls, 
we must look at the condition of 
women throughout the world, even 
here in the United States. At a recent 
hearing last week of the Education and 
Labor Committee, we find that women 
make 82 cents on the dollar compared 
to what men make. And the sad part is 
that, as women progress in their years 
of work, the gap between men and 
women actually expands because they 
start at a lower base. Men’s salaries go 
up, women’s salaries remain stagnant, 
and the gap becomes even greater. 
So as we remember the women of 
Guatemala, let’s remember that there 
is still gender bias throughout the 
world. 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlelady from California’s 
Ninth District, a member of the 

Committee on Appropriations, BARBARA 
LEE. 

Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for your leadership, and just say today 
that I fully support and am a cosponsor 
of this resolution, and want to thank 
Congresswoman SOLIS for staying on 
point and continuing to focus and 
make sure that this House of Representatives 
understands the type of 
torture and violence that is taking 
place with regard to Guatemalan 
women. 

As the resolution says, the murders 
of Guatemalan women and girls have 
increased significantly, from 303 to 
more than 500 in 2006. Since 2001, unfortunately, 
more than 2,500 women and 
girls have been killed. So it is up to us, 
I believe, to make sure that we as a 
neighbor to Guatemala, as people who 
care about women and girls, that we 
urge the Guatemalan Government to 
do some of the things that have been 
put forth in this resolution. 

First, of course, we extend our sincere 
condolences and deepest sympathies 
to the families of the women 
and the girls who have been murdered 
in Guatemala. But also we have to do 
more than just extend our sympathy 
and express solidarity. We have to do 
what this resolution says. Let me just 
mention a couple of those things that 
we need to do. 

We need to urge the Government of 
Guatemala to recognize domestic violence 
and sexual harassment as criminal 
acts. Nothing less than that will 
do. We need to make sure that our Secretary 
of State works with the Government 
of Guatemala to hold those accountable 
for their crimes. We need to 
make sure that the ambassador continues 
to meet with the families and 
the victims of the women and girls. We 
also need to make sure, and this resolution 
calls upon our Secretary of 
State, to develop a comprehensive plan 
to address and combat the growing 
problem of violence against women in 
Latin America. 

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. SIRES, because 
this is such an important effort 
for women and girls, not only in Guatemala 
and Latin America, but for 
women and girls throughout the world. 

Ms. LINDA T. SA´ NCHEZ of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 100, to 
express sympathy to the families of women 
and girls murdered in Guatemala. The senseless 
atrocities being committed in Guatemala 
are a grim reminder of the injustices that 
plague women and girls throughout the world. 
It is imperative that we speak out as a nation 
against these malicious acts, which demonstrate 
an utter lack of respect for human 
life. 

These irrational acts of violence targeted 
against women are not just a looming problem 
in Guatemala. Femicide has afflicted other 
countries in the world, but our attention turns 
to Guatemala as the most recent and serious 
case of negligence by government officials. 
According to reports, 40 percent of killings 
were never investigated or the investigations 


H4246 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

were simply shelved. This pattern of impunity 
by the Guatemalan Government cultivates and 
perpetuates the cycle of violence. 

It has taken pressure from the international 
community to highlight this gross violation of 
human rights and force the Guatemalan Government 
to take steps towards alleviating 
these problems. Guatemalan officials have recently 
created a special police commission 
and prosecutorial unit to solely focus on 
femicide crimes. 

Although these are important and necessary 
steps, more must be done to address these 
issues. 

It is necessary for this House to focus our 
attention to Guatemala’s passive attitude. This 
is why I urge my colleagues to join me in voting 
‘‘yes’’ on H. Res. 100. 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LYNCH). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SIRES) that the House suspend 
the rules and agree to the resolution, 
H. Res. 100. 

The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolution 
was agreed to. 

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 

f 

CALLING ON VIETNAM TO IMMEDIATELY 
AND UNCONDITIONALLY 
RELEASE POLITICAL PRISONERS 
AND PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE 


Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the resolution 
(H. Res. 243) calling on the Government 
of the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam to immediately and unconditionally 
release Father Nguyen Van 
Ly, Nguyen Van Dai, Le Thi Cong 
Nhan, and other political prisoners and 
prisoners of conscience, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 

The Clerk read the title of the resolution. 
The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. RES. 243 
Whereas, on February 18, 2007, Vietnamese 
police raided the parish house of Father 
Nguyen Van Ly and confiscated computers, 
telephones, more than 100 mobile phone 
cards, and more than 200 kilograms of documents; 
Whereas the police moved Father Ly to the 
remote location of Ben Cui in central Vietnam, 
where he is under house arrest; 
Whereas Father Ly is a former prisoner of 
conscience, having spent a total of over 13 
years in prison since 1983 for his advocacy of 
religious freedom and democracy in Vietnam; 
Whereas Father Ly is an advisor of ‘‘Block 
8406’’, a democracy movement that started in 
April 2006 when hundreds of people throughout 
Vietnam signed public petitions calling 
for democracy and human rights; 
Whereas Father Ly is also an advisor of a 
new political party, the Vietnam Progression 
Party, and one of the primary editors of 
‘‘Freedom of Speech’’ magazine; 
Whereas, on March 6, 2007, Vietnamese police 
arrested one of Vietnam’s few practicing 
human rights lawyers, Nguyen Van Dai, who 

has defended individuals arrested for their 
human rights and religious activities, is the 
co-founder of the Committee for Human 
Rights in Vietnam, and is one of the principal 
organizers of the Block 8406 democracy 
movement; 

Whereas, on March 6, 2007, Vietnamese police 
also arrested Le Thi Cong Nhan, a 
human rights lawyer, a member of ‘‘Block 
8406’’, the principal spokesperson for the Progression 
Party, and a founder of the Vietnamese 
Labor Movement; 

Whereas Father Ly, Nguyen Van Dai, and 
Le Thi Cong Nhan have been charged with 
disseminating propaganda against the Socialist 
Republic of Vietnam under article 88 
of the Penal Code of Vietnam; 

Whereas Father Ly was tried and convicted 
on March 30, 2007, and sentenced to 8 years in 
prison; 

Whereas if convicted, Nguyen Van Dai and 
Le Thi Cong each could be sentenced to up to 
20 years in prison; 

Whereas Le Quoc Quan is a lawyer who 
traveled to the United States in September 
2006 to research civil society development as 
a Reagan-Fascell Fellow at the National Endowment 
for Democracy; 

Whereas Le Quoc Quan returned to Vietnam 
in early March 2007 and was arrested by 
Hanoi police on March 8, 2007; 

Whereas Le Quoc Quan has been charged 
under Article 79 of the Penal Code of Vietnam 
which prohibits activities aimed at 
overthrowing the Government and carries 
extremely severe prison terms and even the 
death penalty; 

Whereas in none of their activities have 
Father Ly, Nguyen Van Dai, Le Thi Cong 
Nhan, or Le Quoc Quan advocated or engaged 
in violence; 

Whereas the arrest of and charges against 
Father Ly, Nguyen Van Dai, Le Thi Cong 
Nhan, and Le Quoc Quan violate Article 69 of 
the Vietnamese Constitution, which states 
that ‘‘The citizen shall enjoy freedom of 
opinion and speech, freedom of the press, the 
right to be informed and the right to assemble, 
form associations and hold demonstrations 
in accordance with the provisions of 
the law’’; 

Whereas Father Ly, Nguyen Van Dai, Le 
Thi Cong Nhan, and Le Quoc Quan have been 
arrested and charged in contravention of the 
rights enshrined in the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 
to which Vietnam is a state party, specifically 
Article 18 (freedom of religion), Article 
19 (freedom of expression) and Article 22 
(freedom of association); 

Whereas Vietnam recently has imprisoned, 
detained, placed under house arrest, or otherwise 
restricted numerous other peaceful 
democratic and religious activists for reasons 
related to their political or religious 
views, including Nguyen Binh Thanh, 
Nguyen Phong, Nguyen Ngoc Quang, Nguyen 
Vu Binh, Huynh Trung Dao, Nguyen Tan 
Hoanh, Tran Thi Le Hang, Doang Huy 
Chuong, Doan Van Dien, Le Ba Triet, 
Nguyen Tuan, Bui Kim Thanh and Tran Quoc 
Hien; 

Whereas the United States Congress agreed 
to Vietnam becoming an official member of 
the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2006, 
amidst assurances that the Vietnamese Government 
was steadily improving its human 
rights record and would continue to do so; 

Whereas the group of Asian countries at 
the United Nations have nominated Vietnam 
as the sole regional candidate for a non-
permanent seat on the United Nations Security 
Council for the 2008–2009 biennium, and 
pursuant to the United Nations Charter, 
Vietnam would be required to discharge its 
duties in accordance with the purposes of the 
United Nations, including the promotion and 

encouragement of respect for human rights 
and fundamental freedoms for all; and 

Whereas the arbitrary imprisonment and 
the violation of the human rights of citizens 
of Vietnam are sources of continuing, grave 
concern to Congress, and the arrests of Father 
Ly, Nguyen Van Dai, Le Thi Cong Nhan, 
and Le Quoc Quan are part of a trend toward 
increasing oppression of human rights advocates 
in Vietnam: Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That— 

(1) the House of Representatives— 
(A) condemns and deplores the arbitrary 
arrests of Father Nguyen Van Ly, Nguyen 
Van Dai, Le Thi Cong Nhan, and Le Quoc 
Quan by the Government of the Socialist Republic 
of Vietnam and calls for their immediate 
and unconditional release and the dropping 
of all criminal charges, and for the immediate 
and unconditional release of all 
other political and religious prisoners; 
(B) condemns and deplores the violations 
of the freedoms of speech, religion, movement, 
association, and the lack of due process 
afforded to individuals in Vietnam; 
(C) challenges the qualifications of Vietnam 
to be a member of the United Nations 
Security Council, unless the Government of 
Vietnam begins immediately to respect 
human rights and fundamental freedoms for 
all within its own borders; and 
(D) strongly urges the Government of Vietnam 
to consider the implications of its actions 
for the broader relationship between 
the United States and Vietnam; and 
(2) it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that the United States should— 
(A) make a top concern the immediate release, 
legal status, and humanitarian needs 
of Father Nguyen Van Ly, Nguyen Van Dai, 
Le Thi Cong Nhan, and Le Quoc Quan; 
(B) use funds from the newly created 
Human Rights Defenders Fund of the Department 
of State to assist with the legal defense 
and the needs of the families and dependents 
of Father Ly, Nguyen Van Dai, Le Thi Cong 
Nhan, and Le Quoc Quan; 
(C) continue to urge the Government of 
Vietnam to comply with internationally recognized 
standards for basic freedoms and 
human rights; 
(D) make clear to the Government of Vietnam 
that it must adhere to the rule of law 
and respect the freedom of religion and expression 
in order to broaden its relations 
with the United States; 
(E) make clear to the Government of Vietnam 
that the detention of Father Ly, 
Nguyen Van Dai, Le Thi Cong Nhan, Le Quoc 
Quan, and other political prisoners and prisoners 
of conscience and other human rights 
violations are not in the best interest of 
Vietnam because they create obstacles to 
improved bilateral relations and cooperation 
with the United States; 
(F) examine current human rights violations 
by the Vietnamese Government and 
consider re-imposing on Vietnam the ‘‘country 
of particular concern’’ (CPC) designation, 
which was removed on November 13, 2006, 
pursuant to the International Religious 
Freedom Act of 1998; and 
(G) in order to advance these freedoms and 
rights, and to strengthen the long-term relationship 
between the United States and Vietnam, 
initiate new foreign assistance programs 
to advance the capacity and networking 
abilities of Vietnamese civil society, 
including— 
(i) rule of law programs to train Vietnamese 
human rights lawyers, judges, academics, 
and students about international 
human rights law; 
(ii) public diplomacy initiatives to inform 
and teach Vietnamese citizens about international 
human rights norms and responsibilities; 
and 

May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4247 

(iii) projects that support organizations 
and associations that promote the freedom 
of religion, speech, assembly, and association. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) and the gentleman 
from Indiana (Mr. BURTON) 
each will control 20 minutes. 

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the resolution 
under consideration. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from New Jersey? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of this resolution and 
yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 

I would first like to commend the 
distinguished ranking member of the 
Africa and Global Health Subcommittee, 
my friend, Chris Smith of 
New Jersey, for the introduction of 
this important resolution. 

This year, Vietnam’s program of economic 
liberalization and openness took 
its most dramatic and important step 
when it joined the World Trade Organization. 
Just over 30 years after the 
Communist takeover of Saigon, Vietnam 
is now looking to promote foreign 
direct investment and to become a full 
member of the global economic community. 


The U.S.-Vietnam relationship has 
undergone a similar transformation. 

U.S. Presidents now regularly visit our 
once sworn enemy. United States’ engagements 
with Vietnam can and 
should continue in order to promote a 
more open and prosperous Vietnam. 
This will better the lives of the Vietnamese 
people. Yet, as the U.S.-Vietnam 
relationship matures, the Government 
of Vietnam must understand that 
U.S. principles of democracy, freedom, 
and human rights will never soften by 
impressive economic growth rates. 
The unacceptable arrest of four innocent 
Vietnamese citizens by the government 
for exercising their right of 
free expression is evidence of how far 
Vietnam must come before it can be 
considered a genuine friend of the 
United States. 

The resolution we are considering 
today demonstrates our commitment 
to human rights, democracy, and the 
rule of law in Vietnam. It does this by 
calling for the immediate release of 
these political prisoners, urging the 
Government of Vietnam to comply 
with international standards of human 
rights, and considering the implication 
of its actions for the broader relationship 
between the United States and 
Vietnam. 

I strongly support this resolution, 
and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield such time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from New Jersey 
(Mr. SMITH) and ask unanimous 
consent that he be allowed to manage 
the time on this side. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Indiana? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 

Vietnam has long been known as a 
major violator of human rights. The 

U.S. House of Representatives went on 
record in the 109th Congress condemning 
and deploring the violations 
of human rights in Vietnam and 
strongly urging the Vietnamese Government 
to consider the implications 
of its human rights abuses for the 
broader relationship between the 
United States and Vietnam. I point out 
parenthetically that the House almost 
a year ago to the day passed a resolution 
that I sponsored similar to this 
one, H. Con. Res. 320, on April 6, 2006. 
There was some initial improvement. 
Regrettably, there has been a snapback 
to its original and even worsened situation 
when it comes to human rights observance. 
That is why I have sponsored 
H. Res. 243—calling on Vietnam to immediately 
and unconditionally release 
Fr. Ly, Mr. Dai, Mrs. Whan and other 
political prisoners and prisoners of conscience. 
Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Department of 
State in its ‘‘Country Reports on 
Human Rights Practices’’ notes that 
the human rights record in Vietnam remains 
‘‘unsatisfactory,’’ and that government 
officials continued ‘‘to commit 
serious abuses.’’ The U.S. Commission 
on International Religious Freedom 
stated in its 2006 annual report 
that Vietnam ‘‘continues to commit 
systematic and egregious violations of 
freedom of religion and belief.’’ 

However, in November 2006, pursuant 
to a boatload of assurances and solemn 
promises that the human rights situation 
would improve dramatically, Vietnam 
became the first country to be removed 
from the list of Countries of 
Particular Concern, so designated pursuant 
to the International Religious 
Freedom Act. Late last year, the U.S. 
Congress agreed to Vietnam becoming 
an official member of the World Trade 
Organization, and a group of Asian 
countries at the United Nations has 
nominated Vietnam as the sole regional 
candidate for a nonpermanent 
seat on the U.S. Security Council. 

Despite this flurry of international 
recognition and tangible economic benefit, 
despite the hopes of many, including 
and especially the Vietnamese people, 
Vietnam has reverted to its repressive 
practices and has arrested, imprisoned, 
and imposed lengthy prison sentences 
on numerous individuals whose 
only crime has been to seek democratic 
reform and respect for fundamental 
human rights in their country. 

The crackdown in Vietnam, Mr. 
Speaker, on religious and human rights 
activists is unconscionable and of 
course it is unnecessary. I have been to 
Vietnam, Mr. Speaker, on many human 
rights trips, and chaired several hearings 
on it as well. But on one of the 
most recent trips, I actually met with 
Father Nguyen Van Ly who recently 
got 8 years in prison; I also met with 
Nguyen Van Dai and about 60 other 
human rights activists and religious 
leaders and people who are pressing for 
reform in that country. 

I was struck by how smart, talented, 
and kindhearted these people were. I 
believe they are Vietnam’s best and 
brightest and bravest. I was amazed 
how they harbor no malice, no hate towards 
the government; nor do they 
hate the government leaders. They 
only want a better future for their 
country, and each and every one of the 
people I met with was committed, and 
is committed, to peaceful nonviolent 
reform. 

But just one month ago, on March 30, 
the government sentenced Father Ly 
to 8 years imprisonment after subjecting 
him to a sham trial for distributing 
‘‘antigovernment materials.’’ 

When I met with Father Ly he was 
under house arrest, he sounded just 
like the activists I had met and spoke 
to during the dark years of the Warsaw 
Pact and the Soviet Union. During 
those years of domination by communism, 
men like Vaclav Havel, Lech 
Walesa, and Anatoly Shcharansky— 
people who, like the folks in Charter 77 
in the Czech Republic—only wanted 
freedom, democracy, and human rights. 
None of them wanted violence, and yet 
we see that men like Father Ly now 
get 8 years imprisonment on top of the 
13 years he has previously served in the 
Gulag on trumped-up charges. Jailing 
dissidents is a window into the malice 
and evil of the government of Vietnam. 

As I mentioned, attorney, Nguyen 
Van Dai, a tenacious campaigner for 
human rights who uses the law, international 
and domestic, to press his 
cause, nonviolently—he’s totally nonviolent, 
hates violence, abhors it, 
stands up and tries to use the law to 
try to get remedies for his clients. He, 
too, is now awaiting a trial which will 
be another kangaroo court and a sham 
deal at that. 

b 1615 
Another human rights lawyer, Le Thi 
Cong Nhan, is a labor activist. And according 
to reports, she too now will undergo 
another one of these bogus trials. 
We know that Vietnam, due to our 
robust trade and recently enacted 
PNTR and their ascension into the 
WTO, we know that trade will increase 
between the United States and Vietnam. 
So when this lawyer seeks to be 
an activist for what the ILO and all of 
us in this room believe to be fundamental 
freedoms like collective bargaining, 
the secret police raids her office 
and drags her away. She is now 
awaiting another one of these kangaroo 
trials. 


H4248 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

Another victim of the crackdown is 
Le Quoc Quan. Here’s a person who just 
returned to Vietnam in early March 
after completing a fellowship right 
here in Washington at the National Endowment 
for Democracy. He was arrested 
on March 8, apparently for the 
crime of engaging in research on civil 
society development at NED. And all of 
us who know NED know what a great, 
completely transparent and human 
rights rule of law oriented organization 
NED is, a group funded, by this Congress 
and by the executive branch. It’s 
a great organization. Quam goes back 
to victim and is basically arrested soon 
after his arrival and now he is awaiting 
a trial as well. 

Mr. Speaker, a little over a year ago, 
a group called Block 8406 devised a 
statement of human rights principles. 
It reminds me of Charter 77. Brave men 
and women banded together united by 
a statement of principles, human 
rights concerns. We’ve seen such expressions 
in Cuba, we’ve seen it all over 
the world in despotic countries. These 
brave men and women sign on the dotted 
line, in a way not unlike our own 
forefathers who signed the Declaration 
of Independence. In Vietnam’s case, 
they are pertaning for reforms. And 
openness. And I have read it. It is very, 
very simple and eloquent and to the 
point. It’s all about human rights and 
democratization. And for being part of 
8406, other activists are now being 
caught in this dragnet. 

I would note parenthetically, Father 
Ly was also a signer of this Block 8406 
a manifesto on Freedom and Democracy 
for Vietnam. The 8406 stands for 
April 8, 2006. That’s when they founded 
this courageous organization. 

H. Res. 243, the resolution before us, 
Mr. Speaker, is intended to send a critical 
and timely message to the Vietnamese 
government that these serious 
violations of basic human rights are 
absolutely unacceptable and bring profound 
dishonor on the government of 
Vietnam. 
These human rights violations cannot 
be overlooked. They cannot be 
trivialized. These human rights violations 
which are ongoing, and they 
occur as we meet here today, cannot 
continue without equally serious consequences. 
It also urges our Government 
to make human rights a top priority 
in our bilateral relations with 
Vietnam. I do believe this recent snap 
back to human rights abuse underscores 
the unwitting naivete on the 
part of some who think if we just 
trade, if we just open our pocket books, 
dictatorships will automatically matriculate 
into democracies and freedom 
loving human rights respecting countries. 
It hasn’t happened anywhere. Not 
in the PRC, it has not happened in 
Vietnam and it is not happening anywhere 
where that naive view is embraced. 


So we’ve got to send some clear messages. 
Human rights do matter. And we 
will stand up for those who are mistreated. 
We will stand with the oppressed 
and not with the oppressor. 

Finally, I’ve heard it from informed 
and very reliable sources that some of 
the recent jailees, the human rights activists 
that are now behind bars suffering 
torture and mistreatment, that 
they are being told that the United 
States really doesn’t care about them; 
that we’ve walked away. I have heard 
this on a couple of occasions from people 
who have very good inside information. 
They are actually being taunted 
with that kind of mantra. 

I want to tell the presecuted—you 
are not forgotten. It’s a bipartisan expression 
today, you are no forgotten. 
We care deeply about these human 
rights activists and we will not forget 
you. And we will do all that is humanly 
possible, God willing, to effectuate 
your release and hopefully, some day, 
see a free and democratic Vietnam. 

At this point in the RECORD, I would 
like to include 8406—manifesto on 
Freedom and Democracy for Human 
Rights. 
MANIFESTO 2006 ON FREEDOM AND DE


MOCRACY FOR VIETNAM BY 118 DEMOC


RACY ACTIVISTS INSIDE VIETNAM— 

APRIL 8, 2006 

DEAR COMPATRIOTS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF 
VIETNAM: We, the undersigned, representing 
hundreds of Vietnamese democracy activists 
inside Vietnam and all those Vietnamese 
citizens yearning for True Democracy for 
Vietnam, hereby unanimously proclaim the 
following: 

I. THE CURRENT REALITIES OF VIETNAM 
1. In the August 1945 Revolution, the entire 
Vietnamese nation made a choice for national 
independence and not socialism. Vietnam’s 
Declaration of Independence on September 
2, 1945 did not contain a single word 
about socialism or communism. The two 
mainsprings behind the success of that Revolution 
were the Vietnamese people’s aspiration 
for national independence and also the 
desire to fill the power vacuum that existed 
after the Japanese surrender on August 15, 
1945, following their overthrow of the French 
colonial administration on March 9, 1945. 
It is thus clear that the Vietnamese communists 
had abandoned the main objective of 
the August Revolution. As a result, the Vietnamese 
peoples’ aspiration for self-determination 
was disregarded. There have been 
two occasions, one in 1954 in North Vietnam 
and the other in 1975 in all of Vietnam, when 
there were good opportunities for the Vietnamese 
nation to set a new course towards a 
true democracy. Sadly, the Communist 
Party of Vietnam (CPV), failed to take advantage 
of those opportunities. This failure 
is due to the well-known fact, as propounded 
by Lenin, that once a dictatorship of the proletariat 
has been installed, its very first 
function is to foster violence and repressive 
terror! 

2. On September 2, 1945 in Hanoi, Ho Chi 
Minh, President of the Interim Government 
of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, solemnly 
declared to the [Vietnamese] nation 
and the world that: ‘‘All men are created 
equal, endowed by their Creator with certain 
inalienable Rights, among them the Right to 
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,’’ 
undying words taken from the U.S. Declaration 
of Independence of 1776. Interpreted 
broadly, this sentence can mean that all nations 
are created equal and that they are entitled 
to Life, Freedom and Happiness. The 
1791 French Declaration on Human and Civil 
Rights also proclaims: ‘‘All people are born 
free and have equal rights, and they must remain 
free and equal in all rights.’’ These are 
undeniable truths . . .’’ (This quote is taken 
directly from the September 2, 1945 Vietnamese 
Declaration of Independence). 

Nevertheless, the communist government 
of Vietnam began to trample upon these sacred 
rights the moment they came to power. 

3. By February 1951, the Vietnam Workers 
Party (VWP, now rechristened the CPV) proclaimed 
in a Manifesto at its Second Party 
Congress that: ‘‘The ideology of the VWP is 
Marxism-Leninism.’’ This was something 
that was even more clearly expressed in the 
Party Bylaws, under the rubric of ‘‘Goal and 
Leading Principles’’: ‘‘The Vietnam Workers 
Party takes the ideology of Marx-Engels-
Lenin-Stalin and the thought of Mao Zedong 
in combination with the revolutionary realities 
of Vietnam to be its ideological foundation 
and compass for all Party activities. 
Since then, especially in the North after 
1954, and in the entire country after April 30, 
1975, the specter of Communism has been imposed 
on the Vietnamese nation. For all 
practical purposes, this specter has been 
used to deprive the Vietnamese people of all 
their human rights. And even today, its 
overwhelming influence is evident in the 
spiritual as well as the material spheres of 
the Vietnamese nation. 

II. UNIVERSAL LAWS AFFECTING ALL SOCIETIES 
1. History has demonstrated that under 
every totalitarian regime, whether communist 
or non-communist, all democratic 
rights and freedoms are mercilessly repressed, 
the difference being only in the degree 
of repression. Unfortunately, to this day 
the Vietnamese nation is still one of the few 
that is under the rule of a totalitarian communist 
regime. This fact is unabashedly declared 
in Article 4 of the Socialist Republic 
of Vietnam (SRV) Constitution, which says: 
‘‘The CPV. . . follows Marxism-Leninism and 
the thought of Ho Chi Minh, and it is the 
leading force of the state and society.’’ It is 
on the basis of this article that democratic 
rights and freedoms of the Vietnamese people 
have been extremely curtailed. 
2. The power structure in Vietnam rejects 
competition and totally minimizes the possibility 
of its replacement by something else. 
This record has helped accelerate the degeneration 
of government, and its transformation 
from what it started out to be. Because 
there are no rules and principles regarding 
fair competition in the current political 
culture of the country, election after 
election, people have not been allowed to 
choose the most deserving individuals and 
political parties to represent them. For that 
reason the leadership, management and operational 
set-ups become ever more corrupt, 
and can now be compared to a creaky piece 
of equipment from the center down to the localities. 
As a result, Vietnam is now a nation 
that has fallen way behind other nations in 
the region and in the world. In the prevailing 
environment, this shameful national performance 
and other nation-wide problems 
are beyond correction. The problem of all 
problems, the source of all evils, resides in 
the fact that the CPV is now the one and 
only political force leading Vietnam! The realities 
of history have shown that any country, 
once it has fallen into the orbit of Communism, 
ends up in ruin and misery. The Soviet 
Union itself, the very cradle of world 
communism, has, together with other former 
Eastern European countries valiantly overcome 
its own weaknesses to rediscover the 
correct path leading them forward. 
3. We all understand that no one can remake 
history, but it is possible to redirect 
its course. What is even more important is 
that through history’s lessons, one can find 
the correct orientation for the nation’s future. 
The path chosen by the CPV for the Vietnamese 
nation was designed in haste, and 

May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4249 

thoughtlessly imposed. That is why today, it 
is necessary to choose once again a new path 
for our nation. And a path chosen by the entire 
nation must necessarily be better than 
the one chosen by just one person or one 
group of persons. Given that the CPV is, 
after all, only one component of the nation, 
it should not claim to speak on behalf of the 
entire nation! Considering that for almost 
half a century, from 1954 to 2006, the ruling 
party in Vietnam has usurped the voice of 
the nation, it is by no means a legitimate 
government! Why? Because there had simply 
not been a single free election during all that 
time in Vietnam. 

On the basis of the above realities and the 
stated universal laws, being fully conscious 
of our responsibilities as citizens, and faced 
with the nation’s fate, we would like to declare 
the following to our compatriots both 
inside and outside of Vietnam: 

III. OBJECTIVE, METHODS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF 
OUR STRUGGLE 
1. The highest objective in the struggle to 
fight for freedom and democracy for the Vietnamese 
nation today is to make sure that 
the present political regime in Vietnam is 
changed in a fundamental way, not through 
incremental ‘‘renovation’’ steps or, even 
worse, through insignificant touch-ups here 
and there. Concretely speaking, it must be a 
change from the monolithic, one-party, non-
competitive regime that we have at the 
present time to a pluralistic and multiparty 
system; one in which there is healthy competition, 
in accordance with the legitimate 
requirements of the nation, including at 
least a clear separation of powers among the 
Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches 
of government. This would be in tune with 
international criteria and the experiences 
and lessons Mankind has learned from highly 
respected and successful democracies. 
The concrete objective is to re-establish 
the following fundamental rights of the people: 


The Freedom of Information and Opinion 
as defined in the United Nations’ International 
Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, ratified on December 16, 1966, and endorsed 
by Vietnam on September 24, 1982, Article 
19.2: ‘‘Everyone shall have the right to 
freedom of opinion; this right shall include 
freedom to seek, receive and impart information 
and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, 
either orally, in writing or in print, in 
the form of art, or through any other media 
of his choice.’’ This means that political parties, 
organizations and individuals all have 
the freedom to express their opinions 
through the printed media, radio, television 
and any other mass media without having to 
wait for prior approval by the government. 

The Freedom to Assemble, form Associations, 
Political Parties, Vote and Stand for 
Elected Offices as defined in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, Article 25: ‘‘Every citizen shall have 
the right and the opportunity (a) to take 
part in the conduct of public affairs, directly 
or through freely chosen representatives; (b) 
to vote and to be elected in genuine periodic 
elections which shall be by universal and 
equal suffrage and shall be held by secret 
ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of 
the will of the electors.’’ This means that political 
parties of every orientation are allowed 
to fairly compete in a genuine pluralistic 
and multiparty democracy. 

The Freedom to participate in Independent 
Labor Unions and the Right to Legitimate 
Strikes in accordance with the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights ratified by the United Nations on December 
16, 1966, Articles 7 and 8: ‘‘The States 
Parties to the present Covenant recognize 
the right of everyone to the enjoyment of 

just and favorable conditions of work . . ., 
the right of everyone to form trade unions 
and join the trade union of his choice, subject 
only to the rules of the organization 
concerned, for the promotion and protection 
of his economic and social interests . . . [including] 
the right to strike . . .’’ These 
Labor Unions must be independent of, and in 
practice, not subservient to the state. 

The Freedom of Religion as defined in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, Article 18: ‘‘Everyone shall have 
the right to freedom of thought, conscience 
and religion. This right shall include the 
freedom to have or adopt a Religion or Belief 
of his choice, and the freedom, either individually 
or in community with others and in 
public or private, to manifest his religion or 
belief in worship, observance, practice and 
teaching.’’ These religions must also operate 
independently; they cannot be made the instruments 
of the state. 

2. The method of this struggle must be 
peaceful and non-violent. The Vietnamese 
nation must itself be actively engaged in it. 
Of course, we are extremely thankful for the 
warm and ever more effective support of all 
our friends in the world. Using modern information 
media and through ever larger international 
exchanges, we will seek in every 
way to help our compatriot to fully understand 
the issues involved. Once this has been 
achieved, they surely will know how to act 
appropriately and effectively. 
3. This struggle is meant to make the 
Right Cause triumph over the Bad Cause, 
and, Progress over Backwardness. There are 
popular movements that are currently trying 
to use the laws of life and the tendencies 
of our time in order to defeat those evil 
forces that are trying to go against these 
tendencies and laws. Whether the CPV 
marches hand-in-hand with the Nation or 
not will depend on whether it is objective, 
fair, enlightened and modest enough to accept 
the principle of equality in a fair competition. 
The one-party political regime 
must be once and for all buried in the 
dustbin of history. From such a departing 
point, the Vietnamese nation will be able to 
find its best citizens and the most capable 
political organizations after each election to 
lead it. The ‘‘total triumph of the right 
cause’’ principle will be established, and 
one’s individual life will become better, our 
society more humane, and our Compatriots 
will live together on more friendly terms. 
We hope that this Manifesto would foster 
the positive contributions of our compatriots 
living outside of Vietnam and the support of 
our international friends. We are sincerely 
grateful and call on the United Nations, national 
parliaments, governments, international 
organizations and our friends all 
over the world to continue supporting enthusiastically 
and effectively this fully legitimate 
struggle. This will soon help bring our 
Fatherland, Vietnam, to stand shoulder-to-
shoulder with civilized, moral, prosperous 
and free countries in today’s community of 
Mankind—Unanimously declared in Vietnam 
on 8 April 2006.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further requests for time. 

Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the distinguished gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. WOLF) who 


H4250 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

has been a leader on global human 
rights for 27 years, and that especially 
relates to Vietnam. 

Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. 
SMITH, and for Mr. SMITH’s faithfulness 
to be over here. 

This institution is frankly changing. 
It is changing before our eyes. This institution, 
on both sides of the aisle, almost 
doesn’t seem to care anymore on 
these issues of fundamental human 
rights. This institution needs a little 
bit of Ronald Reagan. 

Many of you voted to give this government 
PNTR. Read the letter. The 
conditions have changed dramatically. 
They’re worse today than when you 
gave them PNTR. And yet this place is 
almost empty. Nobody seems to care 
anymore. 

Father Ly is in jail. The American 
Ambassador ought to be fired. This administration 
has done a horrible job. 

Let me just read some of the things 
that have gone on since we gave them 
PNTR and the President went over 
there. February 18, 2007, the second day 
of Lunar, Father Ly was banished to a 
remote secluded area. Does the Congress 
care? Does the administration 
care? 

March 5, 2007, security forces in Saigon 
told Mrs. Bui Ngoc Yen that they 
had an order to arrest her husband. 

March 8, 2007, Reverend Nguyen Cong 
Chinch were brutally assaulted by the 
security forces. 

March 8, 2007, two prominent human 
rights activists and lawyers, Mr. 
Nguyen Van Dai and Ms. Le Thi Cong 
Nhan were arrested in Hanoi, told they 
would be detained for 4 months. 

March 9, 2007 Mr. Tran Van Hoa, a 
member of the People’s Democracy 
Committee, summoned by the security 
forces and threatened with ‘‘immeasurable 
consequences,’’ that’s in quotes. 

March 10, 2007, Do Nam Hai, an engineer 
writing under the pen name 
Phuong Nam, one of the leading members 
of the Alliance for Democracy told 
by security forces he could be indicted 
any time. 

March 10, the same day, state security 
forces raided the home of Ms. Tran 
Khai Thanh, a writer. 

March 12, 2007, do you get a pattern 
here? Can anyone see a pattern sort of 
developing here? 

The Congress gave them MFN. Probably 
a majority on both sides gave 
them MFN. But do you see a pattern 
here? 

March 10, state security forces. 

March 12, lawyer Le Quoc Quan, a 
consultant on local government for the 
World Bank was arrested in his hometown. 


April 5, 2007 the Vietnamese authorities 
in Hanoi rudely prevented Congresswoman 
LORETTA SANCHEZ, from 
your side of the aisle, from meeting 
with several dissidents’ wives at a 
gathering organized at the Ambassador’s 
house. 

Now this Ambassador, frankly, and 
Mr. LANTOS, and we have a bill that’s 
coming up, this Ambassador has failed 

to turn the American Embassy into an 
island of freedom. During the days of 
Ronald Reagan, one of the greatest 
presidents we have ever had, not only 
in modern times, but in all times, 
turned the American Embassy in Moscow 
into an island of freedom that dissidents 
felt comfortable coming, and 
they were invited. 

This Ambassador is just the opposite. 
He’s silent. Dr. Martin Luther King 
said silence is the real danger. You expect 
the silence of your enemies, but 
you don’t expect the silence of our 
friends. 

Furthermore, the Hanoi government 
still has a large number of dissidents 
that are in jail. 

Lastly, and I’m going to read a letter 
that I’m going to put in the RECORD 
that we sent to Secretary Rice the 
other day. The Vietnamese American 
community, a young but energetic 
group comprised of more than 1 million 
citizens, should be included in future 
dialogues with U.S. government officials. 
They know the history, the culture 
and the values of Vietnam. They 
also scrutinize the history and the tactics 
of communism and the Communist 
government’s habits at the negotiating 
table. 

I sincerely believe that the history of 
Vietnam must inform our approach to 
this and all other aspects of foreign 
policy. And the Vietnamese American 
community is a tremendous asset in 
this regard. Quite frankly, this administration, 
when Ambassador Marine 
leaves, ought to put a Vietnamese 
American in who understands these 
issues. So I’m going to submit this in 
the RECORD. 

But these are important issues. This 
Congress just can’t give these people 
human rights. And frankly, there is a 
whole shift taking place. I saw the 
other day, and if I’m wrong, I’ll correct 
it for the record, that Steven Spielberg 
is now representing the Chinese government 
for the Olympics. One of 
Spielberg’s greatest movies was the 
movie that he did with regard to what 
took place by Nazi Germany, 
Schindler’s List. 

Well, now there’s a Schindler’s list 
operation going on in China. There are 
42 Catholic bishops that are in jail with 
China, with priests. And for those who 
might think it might be amusing, 
China is the one that’s trying to do 
nothing with regard to the genocide in 
Darfur. 400,000 people have died. The 
head of China goes to Khartoum 2 
months ago with a bold announcement. 
The announcement is they are going to 
build a new palace for the Sudanese 
that are bringing about genocide. 
Genocide in Darfur. 

There are 46,000 house church leaders, 
leaders, committed leaders, house 
church leaders that are in jail in China 
today. In Tibet, it’s against the law to 
have a picture of the Dalai Lama, and 
the Chinese public security police sent 
three public security police to my district 
spying on Rebiya Kadeer. If you 
read the Washington Post editorial last 

week, spying on Rebiya Kadeer in Fairfax 
County. Her three kids have been 
arrested. She’s a Muslim. Her three 
kids have been arrested. So I just see, 
and I want to thank Mr. SMITH for 
doing this, but frankly, for the Congress 
just to grant MFN to this fundamentally 
evil government, and for us 
to just sort of move on and just kind of 
not care anymore, it just is really troubling. 
When we fail to speak out for the 
least, we fundamentally fail to speak 
out for everyone. And so let me just 
say, I didn’t know this was coming up, 
and I just caught it and came over 
here. I want to thank Mr. SMITH for his 
faithfulness in being involved. And 
frankly, any Member that voted to give 
these guys PNTR, on both sides of the 
aisle, man, you’ve got a great responsibility 
now to really do something on 
these people. These are dissidents that 
are in jail. They are being suffered. 

And frankly, I end by saying we 
ought to do more the way that Ronald 
Reagan did in the 1980s. Speak out on 
human rights, religious freedom and 
those values. And with that, you ought 
to call a role call vote on this because, 
frankly, this government is so dense 
that if they see a voice vote they won’t 
even think it it’s important. There 
ought to be a roll call vote so we can 
send a message on behalf of Father Ly, 
a Catholic bishop, a Catholic priest 
who’s done nothing, and all these other 
people. And frankly, this ambassador 
ought to be shown the door. And we 
ought to put somebody in who represents 
the values of this country. 
Quite frankly, it ought to be a Vietnamese 
American who can go over 
there and advocate on behalf of those 
who are being persecuted. 

DEAR SECRETARY RICE: I am writing to express 
my deep concern regarding the worsening 
human rights situation in Vietnam in 
recent months. After joining the World 
Trade Organization in January 2007, the politburo 
of the Vietnamese Communist Party 
(VCP) has carried out a large-scale brutal 
campaign of arrest against the nascent 
movement for democracy in Vietnam. Ignoring 
all international criticism and strenuous 
protests of the Vietnamese people, inside 
Vietnam and abroad, the communist regime 
in Hanoi has shamefully pushed ahead with 
its crackdown. The following events were 
particularly disconcerting to me: 

On February 18, 2007, the second day of the 
Lunar New Year, which is the most sacred 
time in Vietnamese culture, the communist 
security forces raided Father Nguyen Van 
Ly’s office within the Communal Residence 
of the Hue Archdiocese. Father Ly was later 
banished to a remote, secluded area in Hue. 

On March 5, 2007, security forces in Saigon 
told Mrs. Bui Ngoc Yen that they had an 
order to arrest her husband, Professor 
Nguyen Chinh Kiet, who is a leading member 
of the Alliance for Democracy and Human 
Rights in Vietnam. Professor Kiet was in Europe 
at the time campaigning for democracy 
and human rights in Vietnam. 

On March 8, 2007, Reverend Nguyen Cong 
Chinch and his wife were brutally assaulted 
by security forces of Gia Lai Province in the 
Central Highlands, who then arrested Reverend 
Chinch on undisclosed charges. 

Also on March 8, 2007, two prominent 
human rights activists and lawyers, Mr. 
Nguyen Van Dai and Ms. Le Thi Cong Nhan, 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4251 

were arrested in Hanoi and were told that 
they would be detained for four months as 
part of an undisclosed investigation. 

On March 9, 2007, Mr. Tran Van Hoa, a 
member of the People’s Democracy Party in 
Quang Ninh Province, and Mr. Pham Van 
Troi, a member of the Committee for Human 
Rights in Ha Tay, were summoned by security 
forces and threatened with ‘‘immeasurable 
consequences’’ if they do not stop 
their advocacy for human rights in Vietnam. 

On March 10, 2007, Do Nam Hai, an engineer 
writing under the pen name Phuong Nam 
and one of the leading members of the Alliance 
for Democracy and Human Rights in 
Vietnam, was told by security forces that he 
could be indicted at any time for activity 
against the State. 

Also on March 10, 2007, state security 
forces also raided the home of Ms. Tran Khai 
Thanh Thuy, a writer, on the grounds that 
she advocated for ‘‘people with grievances’’ 
against the government. They took away 
two computers, two cell phones, and hundreds 
of appeals that she had prepared for 
victims of the government’s abuses. 

March 12, 2007, lawyer Le Quoc Quan, a 
consultant on local governance for the World 
Bank, Asian Development Bank, UNDP, and 
Swedish International Development Agency, 
was arrested in his hometown, Nghe An, less 
than a week after he returned from a fellowship 
at the National Endowment for Democracy 
in Washington, D.C. His whereabouts 
are unknown at this time. 

On April 5, 2007, the Vietnamese authorities 
in Hanoi rudely prevented Congresswoman 
Loretta Sanchez (D-CA) from meeting 
with several dissidents’ wives at a gathering 
organized at the U.S. Ambassador’s 
home. The police reportedly used very hostile 
and undignified manners to intervene in 
the meeting. 

Furthermore, the Hanoi communist regime 
is still imprisoning many political dissidents 
and labor advocates such as Nguyen Vu Binh, 
Huynh Nguyen Dao, Truong Quoc Huy, 
Nguyen Hoang Long, Nguyen Tan Hoanh, 
Doan Huy Chuong, the religious leaders of 
the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, Cao 
Dai, Hoa Hoa, and more than 350 lay people 
of the Protestant churches in the Central 
Highland. 

The Vietnamese-Americans in my district, 
as well as all across the country, are very 
angered and distressed by what they perceive 
as a new and aggressive plan of the Hanoi 
government to reverse the progress of human 
rights in Vietnam. They believe that Ambassador 
Marine and his staff are not doing 
enough to stop these blatant violations of 
human rights. 

It seems to me that the Vietnamese government 
is conducting this crackdown on advocates 
of human rights and religious freedom 
because it believes that the U.S. has no 
further leverage in the region. Now that 
Vietnam has been admitted to the WTO, and 
met with the Holy See, they believe they can 
respond in this brutal fashion to supporters 
of democracy and freedom and we will not 
respond. 

I hope that you will make clear to the Vietnamese 
authorities that we will not stand 
by while this violence and intimidation continues. 
I believe the State Department 
should consider putting Vietnam back on the 
list of Countries of Particular Concern, and 
perhaps also consider canceling the planned 
visit of the Vietnamese president and prime 
minister later this year if the human rights 
situation in Vietnam has not improved. 

I appreciate the recent comments by Sean 
McCormack at Voice of America expressing 
deep concern about the March 30 trial and 
sentencing of Father Ly. I ask that you continue 
pressing these issues with the Vietnamese 
government, including the need to 

respect the basic human rights of all Vietnamese 
citizens, especially the freedom of 
information, freedom of expression, and freedom 
of religion. The Vietnamese people 
should be able to choose their own leaders 
through free and fair elections and to use the 
Internet freely without any censures or restrictions. 


I also ask that you encourage the Vietnamese 
authorities to release all political 
prisoners and religious leaders who are currently 
imprisoned because of their peaceful 
expression of their ideas or to fight for their 
religious beliefs. Among these prisoners are 
Father Nguyen Van Ly, Pastors Nguyen 
Cong Chinh and Hong Trung, lawyers Nguyen 
Van Dai, Le thi Cong Nhan, Le Quoc Quan, 
Messiers Truong Quoc Huy, and Nguyen 
Hoang Lon. 

Lastly, I believe the Vietnamese-American 
community, a young but energetic group 
comprised of more than one million citizens, 
should be included in future dialogues with 

U.S. government officials. They know the 
history, culture and values of Vietnam. They 
also have scrutinized the history and tactics 
of communism and the communist government’s 
habits at the negotiating table. I sincerely 
believe that the history of Vietnam 
must inform our approach to this and all 
other aspects of foreign policy, and the Vietnamese-
American community is a tremendous 
asset in this regard. I respectfully request 
that you invite a small representation 
of the Vietnamese-American community to 
join the U.S. delegation in next month’s 
human rights dialogue. 
Best wishes. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK R. WOLF, 

Member of Congress.

INHERITED PERSECUTION: CHINA IMPRISONS 
THE SON OF A HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST 
Last week China sentenced Ablikim 
Abdureyim to 9 years in prison. His crime? 
Having a human rights activist for a mother. 
His mother, Rebiya Kadeer, a Nobel Peace 
Prize nominee, had been warned. When she 
was released from her imprisonment in 2005 
to the United States, she was told to keep 
quiet about China’s treatment of Uighurs, a 
Turkic-Ianguage Muslim minority. Or else. 
Instead, for the past 2 years this former entrepreneur 
has been shouting from the rooftops 
about China’s oppression of her people. 
She has talked to Congress, the European 
Parliament and anyone else who will listen 
about the forced abortions, the harassment 
and killings, the thousands of Uighurs imprisoned 
for supposed treason or ‘‘terrorism.’’ 
She herself was imprisoned for 6 
years for mailing publicly available newspaper 
articles to her husband in America, an 
act China deemed ‘‘endangering of state secrets.’’ 
Right now the Chinese government 
can’t get its hands on her, so it is going after 
her children in China instead. 
Ms. Kadeer’s sons Alim and Kahar 
Abdureyim were convicted last fall of ‘‘tax 
evasion,’’ which she says they confessed to 
after being tortured. Ablikim Abdureyim, 
the son sentenced last week, was officially 
convicted in January of ‘‘instigating and engaging 
in secessionist activities.’’ According 
to the state-run news agency Xinhua, these 
‘‘secessionist activities’’ chiefly consisted of 
asking Yahoo’s ‘‘Uighur-language 
webmaster’’ to post articles on its site—a peculiar 
allegation considering that Yahoo has 
neither a Uighur-language webmaster nor a 
Uighur-language site. 
The Chinese Embassy claims that Ablikim 
Abdureyim’s ‘‘legal rights were protected 
during the trial’’ and that the trial was open 
to the public. But his family says that he 

was denied a lawyer (against Chinese law) as 
well as any contact with his family since his 
arrest last August. His family was not even 
notified about his trial; relatives officially 
learned of it only when Xinhua ran an article 
about his conviction nearly 3 months after 
the fact. If, despite the evidence, China still 
wants to claim that Mr. Abdureyim’s trial 
was ‘‘open’’ and fair, fine: Let it prove it by 
giving him an open and fair appeal. 

Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I just yield myself 2 final 
minutes to close. 

First of all, let me thank Mr. WOLF, 
Chairman WOLF for his very eloquent 
and passionate statement. And I think 
by injecting China into this debate as 
well, there is a modus operandi by both 
of those countries to talk a good game 
about human rights while doing absolutely 
nothing, as a matter of fact, by 
doing just the opposite. It is 
doublespeak. It is Orwellian, and unfortunately, 
it is what is happening on the 
ground today. 

Let me also say that when I visited 
dissidents, several of whom were under 
house arrest in Ho Chi Min City, Hue 
and Hanoi, I was struck by the heart 
breaking vulnerability of those individuals 
and their families, because the secret 
police don’t just go after the individual. 
They target their families, 
their kids, their brothers their sisters-
in-law, their nephews and nieces. It is 
widespread. The bullies inflict maximum, 
they being the communist regime, 
maximum pain on the individual 
and his or her family. 

I’ll give you an example of just how 
it works. One of the individuals who 
downloaded ‘‘What is Democracy’’ from 
the Internet, which was on the U.S. 
embassy Web site, translated and then 
resent it out, got 5 years in prison. He 
was recently let out. But his wife Vu, 
who I met in a Hanoi restaurant with 
at least three bully boys sitting about 
5–10 feet away taking her picture, from 
the secret police, told me again and 
again how fearful she was that she 
would be targeted—and hit. She rides a 
motor bike; she feared that they would 
run her down. Modus operandi, again, 
of the secret police. 

b 1630 
Sure enough, just a few weeks ago, 
she was hit on the road by the police. 
Would you say that was an accident? If 
you think that is an accident, I will 
sell you the Brooklyn Bridge. 
Mr. Speaker, human rights abuse is 
getting worse in Vietnam. It is widespread. 
It is pervasive. And it has got 
to be stopped. We need to speak out 
with one voice. The administration 
needs to speak out with one voice. 
This resolution has a number of action 
clauses in it. I hope it is taken seriously 
both in Hanoi as well as down 
at Foggy Bottom. 
We need to help those suffering individuals. 
We are their last best hope. 
Let’s work for them because they deserve 
our—and Vietnam’s—respect and 
protection. 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART). 


H4252 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of 
Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good 
friend from New Jersey for the time. 

I rise in support of Mr. SMITH’s resolution. 


I was listening to another dear friend 
whom I greatly admire, Mr. WOLF, and 
I want to thank once again Mr. SMITH 
of New Jersey and Mr. WOLF of Virginia 
for consistently being the voices 
for the oppressed throughout the 
world. 

Martin Luther King said, ‘‘An injustice 
anywhere is an affront to justice 
everywhere.’’ And that is what this resolution 
is about. The men and women 
who are languishing in the prisons in 
Vietnam, those being tortured, the people 
being tortured because of their religious 
beliefs, because of their views on 
issues, because of their political aspirations 
for democracy, they are being 
tortured systematically; and that regime 
needs to be condemned not only 
by history but by the Congress of the 
United States. And that is why I support 
so strongly this resolution by Mr. 
SMITH. 

And it is appropriate, as Mr. WOLF 
did, to bring out the torture also being 
committed by the regime in China, 
mainland China. That is also a fascist 
communist regime. These regimes continue 
to be communist, but by opening 
the economy, they manage to get massive 
investments from Big Business 
throughout the world. 

And I heard Mr. WOLF talk about how 
now Mr. Spielberg apparently is lobbying 
for the Chinese communist regime. 
It doesn’t surprise me, after having 
met for hours with Fidel Castro 
and having said that that was one of 
the greatest experiences of his life, 
comparable to the birth of his child. So 
it doesn’t surprise me. 

It doesn’t surprise me about Big 
Business going into Vietnam and China 
and getting profits from the exploitation 
of the workers by the communist 
regimes. 

So I want to simply thank the gentleman 
for the time, and I am in strong 
support of this resolution. It is consistent 
with the best traditions of the 
Congress of the United States. 

Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
share with our colleagues a letter I recently 
sent to Secretary Rice regarding the recent 
crackdown on advocates of human rights and 
religious freedom in Vietnam. Even now, Vietnamese 
authorities are continuing to 
harrass these activists, including by blocking 
our ambassador’s meetings with the 
wives of detained dissidents. We must speak 
out against this repression. 

DEAR SECRETARY RICE: I am writing to express 
my deep concern regarding the worsening 
human rights situation in Vietnam in 
recent months. After joining the World 
Trade Organization in January 2007, the politburo 
of the Vietnamese Communist Party 
(VCP) has carried out a large-scale brutal 
campaign of arrest against the nascent 
movement for democracy in Vietnam. Ignoring 
all international criticism and strenuous 
protests of the Vietnamese people, inside 
Vietnam and abroad, the communist regime 
in Hanoi has shamefully pushed ahead with 
its crackdown. The following events were 
particularly disconcerting to me. 

On February 18, 2007, the second day of the 
Lunar New Year, which is the most sacred 
time in Vietnamese culture, the communist 
security forces raided Father Nguyen Van 
Ly’s office within the Communal Residence 
of the Hue Archdiocese. Father Ly was later 
banished to a remote, secluded area in Hue. 

On March 5, 2007, security forces in Saigon 
told Mrs. Bui Ngoc Yen that they had an 
order to arrest her husband, Professor 
Nguyen Chinh Kiet, who is a leading member 
of the Alliance for Democracy and Human 
Rights in Vietnam. Professor Kiet was in Europe 
at the time campaigning for democracy 
and human rights in Vietnam. 

On March 8, 2007, Reverend Nguyen Cong 
Chinch and his wife were brutally assaulted 
by security forces of Gia Lai Province in the 
Central Highlands, who then arrested Reverend 
Chinch on undisclosed charges. 

Also on March 8, 2007, two prominent 
human rights activists and lawyers, Mr. 
Nguyen Van Dai and Ms. Le Thi Cong Nhan, 
were arrested in Hanoi and were told that 
they would be detained for four months as 
part of an undisclosed investigation. 

On March 9, 2007, Mr. Tran Van Hoa, a 
member of the People’s Democracy Party in 
Quang Ninh Province, and Mr. Pham Van 
Troi, a member of the Committee for Human 
Rights in Ha Tay, were summoned by security 
forces and threatened with ‘‘immeasurable 
consequences’’ if they do not stop 
their advocacy for human rights in Vietnam. 

On March 10, 2007, Do Nam Hai, an engineer 
writing under the pen name Phuong Nam 
and one of the leading members of the Alliance 
for Democracy and Human Rights in 
Vietnam, was told by security forces that he 
could be indicted at any time for activity 
against the State. 

Also on March 10, 2007, state security 
forces also raided the home of Ms. Tran Khai 
Thanh Thuy, a writer, on the grounds that 
she advocated for ‘‘people with grievances’’ 
against the government. They took away 
two computers, two cell phones, and hundreds 
of appeals that she had prepared for 
victims of the government’s abuses. 

March 12, 2007, lawyer Le Quoc Quan, a 
consultant on local governance for the World 
Bank, Asian Development Bank, UNDP, and 
Swedish International Development Agency, 
was arrested in his hometown, Nghe An, less 
than a week after he returned from a fellowship 
at the National Endowment for Democracy 
in Washington, D.C. His whereabouts 
are unknown at this time. 

On April 5, 2007, the Vietnamese authorities

Loretta Sanchez (D–CA) from meeting 
with several dissidents’ wives at a gathering

further leverage in the region. Now that 
Vietnam has been admitted to the WTO, and

I hope that you will make clear to the Vietnamese 
authorities that we will not stand

Sincerely, 
FRANK R. WOLF, 

Member of Congress. 

Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, as chair 
of the U.S.-Vietnam Caucus, dedicated to 
strengthening the bilateral relationship between 
the United States and Vietnam, I 
strongly support efforts to help Vietnam improve 
its human rights record and I support 
this resolution. Nothing would do more for this 
important relationship that continued steps by 
Vietnam towards respect for free speech, 
human rights, religious freedom and democratization. 
I have raised this issue at the highest 
levels of Vietnam’s government and continue 
to do so at every opportunity. 

However, given that Vietnam has made significant 
progress over the last decade, I wish 
that we could have passed the version as introduced, 
which focuses on the steps Vietnam 
needs to take, rather than this Committee-
passed version which now includes unhelpful 
language about placing certain sanctions and 
restrictions on the U.S.-Vietnam relationship. I 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4253 

continue to believe that the path of engagement 
and honest dialogue will be a more fruitful 
avenue for the advancement of human 
rights and democracy in Vietnam. 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further requests for time, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SIRES) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 243, as amended. 

The question was taken. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 

Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 

The yeas and nays were ordered. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to clause 8 of rule XX and the 
Chair’s prior announcement, further 
proceedings on this question will be 
postponed.

RECOGNIZING THE HISTORICAL 
SIGNIFICANCE OF CINCO DE MAYO 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the resolution 
(H. Res. 347) recognizing the historical 
significance of the Mexican holiday 
of Cinco de Mayo. 

The Clerk read the title of the resolution. 
The text of the resolution is as follows: 
H. RES. 347 
Whereas May 5, or Cinco de Mayo in Spanish, 
is celebrated each year as a date of great 
importance by the Mexican and Mexican-
American communities; 
Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday commemorates 
May 5, 1862, the date on which 
the Battle of Puebla was fought by Mexicans 
who were struggling for their independence 
and freedom; 
Whereas Cinco de Mayo has become one of 
Mexico’s most famous national holidays and 
is celebrated annually by nearly all Mexicans 
and Mexican-Americans, north and 
south of the United States-Mexico border; 
Whereas the Battle of Puebla was but one 
of the many battles that the courageous 
Mexican people won in their long and brave 
struggle for independence and freedom; 
Whereas the French, confident that their 
battle-seasoned troops were far superior to 
the almost amateurish Mexican forces, expected 
little or no opposition from the Mexican 
army; 
Whereas the French army, which had not 
experienced defeat against any of Europe’s 
finest troops in over half a century, sustained 
a disastrous loss at the hands of an 
outnumbered, ill-equipped, and ragged, but 
highly spirited and courageous, Mexican 
force; 
Whereas after three bloody assaults upon 
Puebla in which over a thousand gallant 
Frenchmen lost their lives, the French 
troops were finally defeated and driven back 
by the outnumbered Mexican troops; 
Whereas the courageous and heroic spirit 
that Mexican General Zaragoza and his men 
displayed during this historic battle can 
never be forgotten; 
Whereas many brave Mexicans willingly 
gave their lives for the causes of justice and 
freedom in the Battle of Puebla on Cinco de 
Mayo; 

Whereas the sacrifice of the Mexican fighters 
was instrumental in keeping Mexico from 
falling under European domination; 

Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday is not 
only the commemoration of the rout of the 
French troops at the town of Puebla in Mexico, 
but is also a celebration of the virtues of 
individual courage and patriotism of all 
Mexicans and Mexican-Americans who have 
fought for freedom and independence against 
foreign aggressors; 

Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder 
that the foundation of the United 
States is built by people from many nations 
and diverse cultures who are willing to fight 
and die for freedom; 

Whereas Cinco de Mayo also serves as a reminder 
of the close spiritual and economic 
ties between the people of Mexico and the 
people of the United States, and is especially 
important for the people of the southwestern 
States where millions of Mexicans and Mexican-
Americans make their homes; 

Whereas in a larger sense Cinco de Mayo 
symbolizes the right of a free people to self-
determination, just as Benito Juarez once 
said, ‘‘El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz’’ 
(‘‘The respect of other people’s rights is 
peace’’); and 

Whereas many people celebrate during the 
entire week in which Cinco de Mayo falls: 
Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the House of Representatives 
recognizes the historical struggle for 
independence and freedom of the Mexican 
people and requests the President to issue a 
proclamation recognizing that struggle and 
calling upon the people of the United States 
to observe Cinco de Mayo with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) and the gentleman 
from Indiana (Mr. BURTON) 
each will control 20 minutes. 

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the resolution under 
consideration. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from New Jersey? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this resolution. 

I would like to begin by applauding 
the efforts and the leadership of the author 
of the resolution, Congressman 
JOE BACA, who is also the chairman of 
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. 

Mr. Speaker, the Cinco de Mayo holiday 
commemorates the May 5, 1862, 
victory of a vastly outnumbered Mexican 
Army under the command of General 
Ignacio Zaragoza over Napoleon 
III’s regiments at the Battle of Puebla. 

The triumph of the Mexican people 
over the French in this battle has come 
to symbolize the fight for freedom and 
justice. To most of us in the United 
States, this holiday is expressed 
through the enjoyment of Mexican and 
Mexican American culture, the food, 
the music, and the customs. This resolution 
encourages continuing those 

celebrations, but it also reminds us 
that Cinco de Mayo is a tribute to the 
contributions that the Mexicans and 
Mexican Americans have made and 
continue to make across our Nation. 

We take pride in these achievements 
and in the continuing dedication of 
thousands of Mexican American men 
and women in uniform. 

Cinco de Mayo reminds us that the 
foundation of the United States is built 
by people from many nations and diverse 
cultures willing to fight and die 
to make ours a stronger and freer 
world. 

I urge my colleagues to support this 
important resolution. 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 

First of all, I want to congratulate 
Mr. BACA, my good buddy, for sponsoring 
this resolution. And I want to 
say very briefly that our side supports 
moving forward with this resolution of 
the gentleman from California, which 
recognizes the historical significance 
of Cinco de Mayo. 

Our good neighbors to the south, 
Mexico, and we here in the U.S.A. have 
many things and values in common, 
and we ought to celebrate and share 
them together, as this resolution does 
today. Cinco de Mayo is an important 
holiday celebrated to commemorate 
May 5, 1862, the date Mexicans fought 
the Battle of Puebla to end their struggle 
for independence and freedom. 

So let us recognize the historic struggle 
for independence and freedom of 
the Mexican people as symbolized by 
this important holiday and celebrate 
and rejoice together the holiday of 
Cinco de Mayo. 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from California’s 
43rd District, chairman of the 
Committee on Agriculture’s Subcommittee 
on Department Operations, 
Oversight, Nutrition, and Forestry. 

(Mr. BACA asked and was given permission 
to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend and colleagues and my friend 
ALBIO SIRES for yielding me the time. I 
would also like to thank Chairman 
LANTOS and Ranking Member ROS-
LEHTINEN and then, of course, my 
friend DAN BURTON and the leadership 
for their support and their effort in 
bringing this bipartisan resolution to 
the floor. 

I rise today in support of H. Res. 347, 
a resolution honoring the significance 
and impact of Cinco de Mayo. This Resolution 
347 recognizes the Cinco de 
Mayo holiday, which commemorates 
May 5, 1862, the date in which the Battle 
of Puebla was fought by Mexicans 
who were struggling for their independence 
and freedom. 

While Cinco de Mayo commemorates 
the Mexican Army’s victory over 


H4254 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

France in this key battle, it was also 
but one of many battles for the courageous 
Mexican people who won their 
long and brave struggle for independence 
and freedom. 

Today the Cinco de Mayo holiday is 
not only the commemoration of the defeat 
of the French foreign army, it is 
also a celebration of virtues of individual 
courage and patriotism of all 
Mexicans and Mexican Americans who 
have fought for freedom and independence 
against foreign aggressors. 

Cinco de Mayo is also a day to celebrate 
the rich cultural heritage that 
Latinos have brought to the United 
States. Latinos are the fastest growing 
minority population in the country, 
representing 45 million people, 17 percent 
of the total population. The 
Latino community has made many important 
contributions in all aspects of 
life: the arts, sports, the business 
world, sciences. Latinos have also 
fought in all American wars beginning 
with the Revolutionary War, earning 41 
Medals of Honor overall. In World War 
II, 500,000 Hispanics fought, 65 Puerto 
Ricans fought. Thirteen Medals of 
Honor, 11 Mexican Americans, one 
Puerto Rican. Today there are over 30 
Latino Members in the United States 
Congress. This statistic points to what 
a driving force the Latino community 
has become in our country economically, 
socially, and politically. 

Cinco de Mayo also provides us with 
a great opportunity to look back at our 
own heritage as Americans. We must 
remember that our country was built 
by people from different homelands 
with different diverse cultures held together 
by common bond with a willingness 
to fight and die for freedom. 

Unfortunately for Latinos, there are 
many inequities that have put our 
communities at a social and economic 
disadvantage. My colleagues and I in 
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus are 
working together in a bipartisan basis 
to end these barriers to increase opportunities 
for Latinos, particularly in 
areas of education, health care, homeownership, 
and equal representation in 
corporate America. As Americans, we 
must unite to achieve these common 
goals. 

In a large sense, Cinco de Mayo symbolizes 
the right of a free people to 
self-determination, just as Benito 
Juarez once said: ‘‘The respect of other 
people’s rights is peace.’’ 

I ask my colleagues to support H. 
Res. 347. 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from the 
15th District in Texas, chairman of the 
Education and Labor Subcommittee on 
Higher Education, Lifelong Learning, 
and Competitivness, and member of the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs (Mr. 
HINOJOSA). 

Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of House Resolution 
347, and also I rise to honor a 
true hero who gave his life to free his 
country from foreign oppression. 

Ignacio Zaragoza Seguin was born in 
1829 near what is now Goliad, Texas, a 

community in my congressional district. 


In 1862 French troops began a march 
to capture Mexico City. They met the 
Mexican forces led by a courageous and 
well-trained 33-year-old general at the 
city of Puebla, Mexico, in a battle that 
lasted the entire day of May 5, 1862. 
Under General Ignacio Zaragoza’s leadership, 
the vastly outnumbered Mexican 
Army forced the withdrawal of Napoleon 
III’s army, the premier army in 
the world. 

b 1645 
French Army losses were heavy, but 
Mexican troop casualties were few. The 
costly delay in Puebla, Mexico helped 
shorten the French intervention. It 
also helped preserve the American 
Union as it kept the French Army too 
busy to directly aid the Confederacy 
with troops during the U.S. Civil War. 
General Zaragoza and his troops received 
a hero’s welcome in Mexico 
City. While visiting his sick troops, 
Ignacio contracted typhoid fever and 
died on September 8, 1862 at the age of 
33, only a few months after the great 
battle against the French. 
President Juarez declared May 5, 
Cinco de Mayo, a national holiday in 
his country. Today, we celebrate Cinco 
de Mayo throughout Mexico and 
around the world, but I hope that as we 
celebrate it, we remember the courage 
and sacrifice of this true hero. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution. 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of H. Res. 347. I rise 
to recognize the historical importance of the 
Mexican holiday Cinco de Mayo. The fifth day 
of May, or Cinco de Mayo, is a special day 
because it represents the importance of freedom, 
liberty and determination for the people 
of Mexico and for Mexican-Americans. It was 
on that day, May 5, 1862, that untrained, outnumbered, 
and outgunned Mexican forces— 
determined to protect their land—successfully 
defended the town of Puebla against the 
French. 

The quest for an independent Mexico started 
on September 16, 1810, when the people 
of Mexico, following the will to become a free 
nation, refused to submit to Spanish rule. The 
struggle went on for 10 years. Finally, in 1821, 
the first independent Mexican government was 
established. 

But being an independent nation was not 
easy. Over the years, Mexico received economic 
support from several nations, France 
and England among them. Later on, even 
Spain supported the new country. Thus, Mexico 
became heavily indebted to foreign powers. 
Due to ongoing political unrest caused by 
many groups struggling for power, Mexico was 
not able to pay back the loans. On July 17, 
1861, President Benito Juarez issued a moratorium 
in which all-foreign debt payments 
would be suspended for a period of two years, 
with the promise that after this period, payments 
would resume. 

In 1862, France, Spain, and England dispatched 
their fleets to Mexican shores pursuing 
not only money but also land rights as 
payment for their loans. A government representative 
greeted them and explained that 

Mexico acknowledge its debts, but had no 
funds to pay them. They were offered payment 
warrants in exchange. 

The Spaniards and the British decided to 
accept the warrants and withdrew from the 
scene. But the French government’s representative 
did not accept the offer and ordered 
his troops to invade the country and 
head toward Mexico City, the nation’s capital. 
They had to cross through the state of Puebla 
to get to the capital. 

Mexican President Benito Juarez. reacted 
immediately and prepared the defense. He 
commanded Ignacio Zaragoza, a young and 
brave General, to fortify the City of Puebla and 
repel the French invaders. 

The battle was by no means even. France, 
under Louis Napoleon’s rule, had the world’s 
most powerful army, and sent more than six 
thousand men to invade Mexico. But the courage 
and the love of freedom impelled the 
Mexican people to fight back. 

General Ignacio Zaragoza led 5,000 ill-
equipped Mestizo and Zapotec Indians called 
Zacapoaxtlas. On the 5th of May 1862, the 
forts of Loreto and Guadalupe, in the city of 
Puebla, became the scene of the historical defeat 
of the great European army. Against overwhelming 
odds, they managed to drive back 
the French army, achieving a total victory over 
soldiers deemed among the best trained and 
equipped in the world and embarking on the 
end of the European domination in America. 

For Mexico, this day has come to represent 
a symbol of Mexican unity and patriotism in 
the history of Mexico. In our country, Cinco de 
Mayo is also a celebration of the rich cultural 
heritage Mexican Americans have brought to 
the United States. 

Hispanics are the fastest-growing minority 
group in the United States. According to the 
most recent data available, the estimated Hispanic 
population in the U.S. is 42.7 million— 
constituting 14 percent of our nation’s population. 


Hispanics now own a record number of 
small businesses—1.6 million, with annual revenues 
of more than $221 billion. Small businesses 
create two-thirds of American jobs, 
and the fastest-growing small business sector 
is Latino-owned firms. 

Today, there are 30 Hispanic Members in 
the United States Congress, including 24 
Democrats, many of whom are Mexican-American, 
representing constituencies in all regions 
of the country, from California to New York, 
from Arizona to Illinois, from Colorado to Florida. 


These gains and numbers tell us that Hispanics 
are a driving force in our country—economically, 
socially and politically. Hispanics 
share the common goals with all other Americans 
of freedom, opportunity, and a chance to 
build a better life. In pursuing these aspirations, 
Hispanics have made important contributions 
to life in the United States in the 
fields of culture, sports, entertainment, business 
enterprise, science, politics and others. 

On Saturday, May 5th, millions of Americans 
will join our neighbors to the south in 
celebrating Cinco de Mayo. On this day, we 
are reminded that all people—regardless of 
their race, color, or gender—have enriched 
cultures and are worthy of respect and self-determination. 


I am happy to be here today to celebrate 
this momentous day and to recognize the values, 
traditions, and positive contributions of

the Mexican culture. I urge all members to join 
me in supporting H. Res. 347, and commemorate 
the historical significance of Cinco de 
Mayo. 

Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SIRES) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 347. 

The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolution 
was agreed to. 

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 

f 

CONGRATULATING THE CITY OF 
CHICAGO FOR BEING CHOSEN TO 
REPRESENT THE UNITED 
STATES TO HOST THE 2016 OLYMPIC 
AND PARALYMPIC GAMES 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent 
resolution (H. Con. Res. 118) 
congratulating the City of Chicago for 
being chosen to represent the United 
States in the international competition 
to host the 2016 Olympic and 
Paralympic games, and encouraging 
the International Olympic Committee 
to select Chicago as the site of the 2016 
Olympic and Paralympic Games. 

The Clerk read the title of the concurrent 
resolution. 

The text of the concurrent resolution 
is as follows: 

H. CON. RES. 118 
Whereas the City of Chicago has been selected 
by the United States Olympic Committee 
to represent the United States in its 
bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympic and 
Paralympic Games; 
Whereas, by 2016, 20 years will have passed 
since the Summer Olympics were held in a 
city in the United States; 
Whereas Chicago is a world-class city with 
remarkable diversity, culture, history, and 
people; 
Whereas the citizens of Chicago take great 
pride in all aspects of their city and have a 
deep love for sports; 
Whereas Chicago already holds a place in 
the international community as a city of immigrants 
from around the world, who are 
eager to be ambassadors to visiting Olympic 
athletes; 
Whereas the Olympic and Paralympic 
Games will be played in the heart of Chicago 
so that athletes and visitors can appreciate 
the beauty of the downtown parks and lake-
front; 
Whereas Chicago is one of the transportation 
hubs of the world and can provide accessible 
transportation to international visitors 
through extensive rail, transit, and 
motorways infrastructure, combined with 
the world-class O’Hare and Midway International 
Airports; 
Whereas the motto of the 2016 Olympic and 
Paralympic Games in Chicago would be 
‘‘Stir the Soul,’’ and the games would inspire 
citizens around the world, both young and 
old; 
Whereas a Midwestern city has not hosted 
the Olympic Games since the 1904 games in 
St. Louis, Missouri, and the opportunity to 

host the Olympics would be an achievement 
not only for Chicago and for the State of Illinois, 
but also for the entire Midwest; 

Whereas hosting the 2016 Olympic and 
Paralympic Games would provide substantial 
local, regional, and national economic 
benefits and growth; 

Whereas Mayor Richard M. Daley, Patrick 
Ryan, and members of the Chicago 2016 Committee 
have campaigned tirelessly to secure 
Chicago’s bid to host the Olympic and 
Paralympic Games; 

Whereas, through the campaign to be selected 
by the United States Olympic Committee, 
Chicago’s citizens, officials, workers, 
community groups, and businesses have demonstrated 
their ability to come together to 
exemplify the true spirit of the Olympic 
Games and the City of Chicago; and 

Whereas the Olympic and Paralympic 
Games represent the best of the human spirit 
and there is no better fit for hosting this 
event than one of the world’s truly great cities: 
Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved by the House of Representatives (the 
Senate concurring), That Congress— 

(1) congratulates the City of Chicago on securing 
the bid to represent United States in 
the international competition to host the 
2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games; and 
(2) encourages the International Olympic 
Committee to select Chicago as the site of 
the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SIRES) and the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. ROS-
LEHTINEN) each will control 20 minutes. 

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the resolution under consideration. 


The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from New Jersey? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of this resolution and 
yield myself such time as I may consume. 


Mr. Speaker, I would first like to 
commend our colleague from Chicago, 
RAHM EMANUEL, for introducing this 
important resolution. His efforts to 
win our Nation the 2016 Olympic games 
are greatly appreciated. 

Mr. Speaker, the 2004 summer Olympic 
games in Athens unfolded before 
the eyes of hundreds of millions of people 
around the world, with some watching 
in person, but many more on television 
every night. It is fair to say that 
the Athens games were a success, despite 
fears of terrorism or that key 
Olympic venues would not be ready. 
Athens was prepared to receive thousands 
of athletes and officials from 
around the world. The Olympic spirit 
thrived as athletes lived out their 
dreams. 

This resolution before the House 
seeks to bring the summer Olympic 
spirit we witnessed in Athens here to 
America for the first time since 1996 in 
the Atlanta Olympic games. This measure 
urges the International Olympic 

Committee to choose the United States 
entry of Chicago to host the 2016 summer 
Olympics. 

Mr. Speaker, the Olympics bring together 
people from all over the world. 
And when they arrive in Chicago, they 
will find a culturally diverse city ready 
and willing to host athletes and spectators 
from every nation. 

Chicago already has developed a public 
transportation infrastructure to ensure 
that visitors from the United 
States and abroad can easily get to the 
Olympic games. Once in Chicago, athletes 
and spectators alike will be able 
to move seamlessly through all Olympic 
venues and practice facilities. 

The Olympic games will be held in 
the heart of Chicago so that everyone 
can enjoy Chicago’s beautiful waterfront 
and park system. Hosting the 
Olympic games will also bring important 
economic benefits to Chicago and 
position it to hold important sporting 
events in the future. 

Mr. Speaker, Chicago is a beautiful, 
thriving American city eager to carry 
on the Olympic tradition. When the 
International Olympic Committee 
meets to choose the site of the 2016 
summer games, I urge committee 
members to choose Chicago. 

Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
resolution, and reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may consume. 


Mr. Speaker, with this week being 
Olympic Week in America in our Nation’s 
elementary schools, there is no 
better time for us to extend our congratulations 
to the City of Chicago for 
being selected to represent the United 
States in the competition to host the 
2016 Olympic and Paralympic games. 

Chicago is a world-class city, known 
for its culture, history, people and love 
of sports, and pizza, and the Bears and 
the Bulls. 

In addition, it boasts renowned architecture 
and a significant transportation 
infrastructure and numerous 
venue options for major events such as 
the Olympic games. 

This is the first step in the international 
process whereby the final selection 
for the site of the games will be 
made in October 2009. Chicago’s likely 
rivals in the 2016 competitions include 
Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Tokyo, Madrid 
and Prague. Other than Miami, of 
course, I can think of no better city to 
represent the United States of America 
in its bid for the Olympics games than 
Chicago. 

With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the member of the Ways 
and Means Committee from the Fifth 
District of Illinois, RAHM EMANUEL. 

Mr. EMANUEL. I thank my colleague 
from Miami. I can think of no other 
city if Chicago didn’t have it than 
Miami. And also my colleague from 
New Jersey. 

You know, both of you have mentioned 
something about Chicago’s 


H4256 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

physical beauty. The reason we are so 
proud, those of us from Chicago, of 
hosting the Olympics is not only our 
physical beauty, but I think you will 
see the character of our people in this 
greater part of Chicago, not just the 
city, but the suburbs, the entire metropolitan 
community, come together and 
host this Olympics and be the representation 
for the United States as we go 
forward in 2009 and try to win for Chicago 
and the greater Chicago area the 
ability to host these Olympics. 

We do have a physically beautiful 
city. Its architecture is world renowned; 
its lakefront is known to everybody. 
In fact, Chicago is known as 
the third coast between both the Pacific 
on the west side and the Atlantic 
on the east side. It is known as the 
third coast in America, sitting on Lake 
Michigan and part of the Great Lakes. 
It has a great physical beauty, but its 
strength comes from the character of 
the people. And I cannot think of anything 
better for city that hosts, any 
time you go to one of its public schools 
we have across the city 50 some odd 
languages being spoken, Chinese being 
spoken in the school, Arabic being 
taught in the school. 

Different languages from all over the 
world. People come to Chicago. It is 
the quintessential American city. 
There is no better place for us to have 
as our standard bearer for the United 
States than Chicago for 2016 to host the 
Olympics. And it is my hope, and great 
hope, that it would become the city 
and be the nominee in 2016 in the selection 
by the Olympic Committee. 

You know, Carl Sandburg, the great 
poet, once said about Chicago, 
‘‘Stormy, husky, brawling. We are the 
city of big shoulders.’’ That is Chicago. 

We have a great mayor, who is a 
great mayor of a great city with great 
people. And you can see it in the pride 
that everybody felt that we were selected 
by our colleagues from around 
the country to be the city to host the 
2016 Olympics. Our sports teams, 
known as the Chicago Cubs, Bulls, 
Bears, the White Sox, Blackhawks, and 
the Sky and the Fire, our soccer teams. 
And I hope, as we go to 2009, that we do 
have and will receive from the international 
community the nod to represent 
the Olympics and show to the 
rest of the world what all of us know in 
Chicago and all of those who come to 
our city know, that we are a great city, 
with a great mayor, with a great people 
that will do right by the world in 
hosting the Olympics. 

I want to thank my colleagues for 
letting me offer this resolution. 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 

Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to yield such time as he 
may consume to our Speaker, Speaker 
HASTERT, the gentleman from Illinois. 

Mr. HASTERT. I thank the 
gentlelady from Miami. 

Mr. Speaker, this is one of the great 
opportunities that comes along once in 
a lifetime, the chance to host the 
Olympics and Paralympic games. 

You know, the Olympic movement is 
something that I have been a part of 
most of my life, as a wrestling coach, 
as an honorary vice president of the 
American Olympics Games, and as one 
who worked in the trenches over the 
years to help found USA Wrestling. 

I have always said the Olympic movement 
is a bright light that brings people 
together through sports. The game 
celebrates the spirit of sportsmanship, 
a spread of a message of unity that inspire 
generations of children all over 
this world. 

I had the honor and privilege of being 
at the Munich games and the Montreal 
games and the L.A. games. Chicago is a 
unique city. As the previous speaker 
said, it is the ‘‘city of big shoulders.’’ 
It is a city of the crossroads of our Nation, 
a city of great architecture, of 
great beauty and of great people. And 
it is the commitment of people coming 
together to say we can do this; the will 
to succeed, the will to be the hosts to 
the world and showcase what this 
country is all about, what our athletes 
are all about, what the American spirit 
is all about. 

We will see the Olympics coming up 
in places like China, in Beijing, we will 
see the Olympics in London, but this is 
our one chance to bring the Olympics 
back to this country, to be the host of 
the world and saying folks, we believe 
in the Olympic movement, we believe 
in this great opportunity, but we will 
do the best in the world to make this 
happen and to make it a success. 

I ask also, ladies and gentlemen, that 
it is understood that this is the work of 
a lot of people. I want to congratulate 
our Mayor Daley and all of the others, 
Pat Ryan and others, who led up that 
committee to make sure that they can 
tell the story to the U.S. Olympic Committee 
so they would get this. 

I urge the adoption of this resolution. 

Mr. Speaker, this is one of those opportunities 
that comes along once during a lifetime— 
the chance to host the Olympic and 
Paralympic Games. 

The Olympic movement is something I have 
been a part of most of my life—as a wrestling 
coach, as Honorary Vice President of the 
American Olympic Movement, and as one who 
worked in the trenches to help fund USA 
Wrestling. 

I have always said that the Olympic movement 
is a bright light that brings people together 
through sports. The Games celebrate 
the spirit of sportsmanship, spread a message 
of unity, and inspire generations of children all 
over the world. 

For the athletes, it is the ultimate level of 
competition—the opportunity to test themselves 
against the best the world has to offer 
in their respective sports. 

A Midwestern city has not hosted the games 
since St. Louis in 1904, so it’s a great honor 
for Chicago to be selected to represent the 
United States in the competition for the 2016 
games. 

And in a bit of irony, Chicago was actually 
chosen as the host city in 1904, but it was 
later moved to St. Louis to coincide with the 
World’s Fair. 

Mr. Speaker, I cannot think of a more welcoming, 
diverse and inspirational place than 

Chicago and the State of Illinois to serve as 
host for the 2016 games. 

Over 30 million foreign and domestic visitors 
come to Chicago every year. It’s a city with a 
rich immigrant history, and we all know what 
a great sports town it can be. In fact, The 
Sporting News named Chicago as the best 
sports city in the United States for 2006. 

I want to congratulate Mayor Daley on all 
his hard work and I look forward to working 
with him and my colleagues in the Illinois delegation 
and the Congress to make this bid a reality. 


I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution. 

Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I would like to 
yield as much time as she might consume 
to Mrs. BIGGERT from Illinois. 

Mrs. BIGGERT. I thank the gentlewoman 
for yielding me time. 

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Con. Res. 118. 

Last month, the United States Olympic 
Committee selected Chicago as the 
official U.S. candidate for hosting the 
2016 Olympic games. It’s been over 100 
years since the Midwest hosted these 
games, and I am pleased to report that 
the Nation’s heartland is ready, willing 
and able to do so again. 

I have lived in the Chicago area my 
whole life and I can’t imagine a better 
location for the summer Olympics. The 
people are welcoming and they are 
sporting spirit is high. A national hub 
of water, railroad and air, the ‘‘Windy 
City’’ has a diversity of culture and 
community that reflects the very best 
of America. And as host of the 2016 
games, Chicago will serve as the Nation’s 
emissary to the world, just as it 
did once during the World’s Fair of 
1893. 

Director of Works for that historic 
fair, Daniel Burnham, once famously 
said, ‘‘Make no little plans. They have 
no magic to stir men’s blood, and probably 
themselves will not be realized. 
Make big plans, aim high in hope and 
work.’’ 

From reversing a river to building 
the world’s tallest tower, Chicagoans 
have a heritage of big dreams. And in 
keeping with its motto for the 2016 
games, ‘‘Stir the Soul,’’ Chicago’s visions 
for the Olympics will be a dream 
the whole country can share in. 

To Mayor Daley, Patrick Ryan, the 
chairman of the Chicago Olympic Committee 
and all its members, I would 
like to extend my personal congratulations. 
Without their hard work and 
dedication, securing this nomination 
would not have been possible. 

I thank the gentleman from Chicago 
(Mr. EMANUEL) for sponsoring this resolution 
and the gentleman from Illinois, 
our former Speaker HASTERT, for his 
hard work in gaining such attention. 

I would also like to thank the efforts 
of all of our friends on the Illinois delegation, 
every one of whom helped in 
this cause tremendously by letters of 
support and by cosponsoring the resolution 
before us today. 

b 1700 
The International Olympic Committee 
will be making its final selection 
in 2009. I invite all my colleagues 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4257 

from across the Nation to unite behind 
Chicago and commit to doing our part 
to bring the 2016 Olympic games back 
to America. 

Mr. Speaker, I support H. Con. Res. 
118, and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 

Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further requests for time, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. DAVIS). 

Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I am delighted that I managed to 
make it here. 

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
friend and neighbor from the Fifth 
Congressional District of Illinois, Mr. 
RAHM EMANUEL, for introducing this 
resolution. 

I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 118, 
congratulating the City of Chicago for 
being chosen to represent the United 
States in the international competition 
to host the 2016 Olympic and 
Paralympic Games, and encouraging 
the IOC to select Chicago as the site of 
the games. 

I can speak with some authority on 
Chicago’s qualifications to host those 
games because I am privileged to represent 
most of the proposed sites: Soldier 
Field, the United Center, U.S. Cellular 
Field, Navy Pier, McCormick 
Place, Grant Park, Douglas Park, Monroe 
Harbor, and facilities at Northwestern 
University and the University 
of Illinois. 

The Olympic Village will rise on land 
in the Seventh District. And although 
the site of the future olympic stadium 
and currently home to the DuSable 
Museum of African American History, 
Washington Park is not in my district, 
it is right adjacent to it. 

So with all due modesty, this assemblage 
of sports facilities is certainly 
one of the finest in the world. Then you 
add to that our infrastructure, our 
world-class architecture, our cultural 
and historical treasures and our 
matchless lakefront, and you have 
yourself the makings of a spectacular 
set of games. 

Now, mix in our sports fan base. The 
Seventh District is home to the Chicago 
Bears, the Chicago Bulls, the Chicago 
White Sox, and the Chicago 
Blackhawks. Mix in the fact that for 
the 2006 Chicago Marathon, starting 
and ending in the district, we had 40,000 
runners and 1.2 million spectators. Mix 
in the fact that Chicago hosted the 2006 
International Gay Games. Mix in the 
fact that Chicago was the first host to 
the Special Olympics in 1968, and you 
will understand that our toddlin’ town 
is for sure a sports town. 

Mr. Speaker, the Olympic Games are 
about fierce, all-out athletic competition. 
But they are also about the greater 
goals of the Olympic movement: 
Fairness, peace, education, and friendship. 
The people of Chicago have a long 
and proud history of leadership in 
these struggles, nationally and internationally. 


Mr. Speaker, Chicago is ready, willing 
and able to make America the 
proud host of the 2016 games. So I join 
with the mayor of the city, the Governor 
of the State, all of the business 
and community leaders in urging passage 
not only of this resolution, but in 
urging the Olympic Committee to select 
Chicago as the site for 2016. 

Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 118, 
which congratulates Chicago for being chosen 
to represent the United States in the international 
competition to host the 2016 Olympic 
and Paralympic Games and encourages the 
International Olympic Committee to select Chicago 
as the site of the 2016 Olympic and 
Paralympic Games. I can not think of a better 
city than my hometown of Chicago to represent 
the United States in its bid to win the 
2016 Olympics Games. 

Chicago is a great American city that is rich 
in diversity, culture, tradition and history. The 
City is home to nearly 3 million residents that 
represent hundreds of different nationalities 
and ethnicities . . . a truly international city. 
Chicago’s vibrant communities, sound infrastructure 
and extensive transportation network 
make it the perfect fit for the 2016 Olympics. 

The Olympic Games are a great opportunity 
for the world to come together and put aside 
their differences to celebrate the achievements 
of athletes. The Olympics have been able to 
transcend cultural, religious and political 
boundaries by making all of us realize that 
there is more that unites us than divides us, 
which could also be said for the City of Chicago. 
The Games have also played a significant 
role in creating social and political 
change in the United States and across the 
globe. 

I would also like to congratulate Mayor 
Daley and Governor Blagojevich for securing 
this victory on behalf of the City of Chicago 
and I wish them continued success in their efforts 
to win this bid in front of the International 
Olympic Committee in 2009. I am confident 
that the rest of the world will realize what we 
already know-that Chicago is the ideal city to 
host the 2016 Olympic Games. I urge my colleagues 
to support H. Con. Res 118. 

Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further requests for time, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SIRES) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, 
H. Con. Res. 118. 

The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the concurrent 
resolution was agreed to. 

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

FLORIDA GATORS 2007 MEN’S 

BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP 

(Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida 
asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 

Ms. CORINNE BROWN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise first of all to thank 
the 415 ‘‘yes’’ votes for the Florida 
Gators, and we will continue to work 
on the four present, teaching them 
good sportsmanship. 

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
my University of Florida basketball 
team for winning back-to-back 
NCAA basketball championships. The 
Gators basketball team is the first to 
successfully defend their basketball 
championship since 1992. Go Gators. 

The Florida Gators teams that won 
those championships exhibit teamwork 
and sportsmanship rarely seen in college 
sports. This is the first time in the 
history that the exact same starting 
five was able to repeat the championship. 
No one left to be stars in the 
NBA. They came back to prove to the 
world that the University of Florida’s 
win was no fluke, and the Florida 
Gators are a championship team that 
have made history. 

Let’s talk history. The Gators’ win 
was the first time in college sports history 
that identical match ups and the 
results were the same. Florida’s Lee 
Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA 
tournament record for three-point field 
goals made with 47, and Florida’s Corey 
Brewer was the tournament’s Most 
Outstanding Player. Coach Billy Donovan 
became the third-youngest coach 
at the age of 41 to win two titles. The 
Gators finished with a 10-game winning 
streak and haven’t lost a post-season 
game in 18 tries, including sweeping 
the Southeastern Conference tournaments 
the last 2 years. 

Coach Billy Donovan should deserves 
credit for building the team from 
scratch and teaching the players how 
to win and how to act like champions. 
This success at Florida opens other opportunities, 
but he has chosen to remain 
a Florida Gator. Coach Donovan 
is truly a great coach and a great leader. 
To close, I would just like to say, 
it’s great to be a Florida gator. 

A SAD ANNIVERSARY FOR THIS 
COUNTRY 

(Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California 
asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 

Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. 
Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, in 
a few minutes, the President of the 
United States will veto the legislation 
to hold the Iraqi government responsible 
and accountable for the benchmarks 
that they promised their citizens 
and the citizens of this country. 
Tonight, after 24,000 U.S. soldiers have 
been wounded, 3,212 have been killed, 
and the country has descended into a 
bloody civil war, what we now see is 
the basis on which the President told 
this country he wanted the surge in the 
escalation was that he would hold the 
Iraqi government responsible. 

In January, he said he would hold the 
Iraqi government to the benchmarks as 
announced, and that if no progress is 
made, they would lose the support of 
the American people. The fact is that 
no progress has been made, and the 
Brookings Institute has shown us that 
situation. 

What we see now, as Secretary Rice 
says, that the administration believes 
that holding the Iraqis accountable to 
these benchmarks that they establish 
as the price of the surge ‘‘doesn’t allow 
us the flexibility and creativity we 
need to move forward.’’ 

You can be creative all you want but 
unless the Iraqis know that there are 
consequences, and that is what this 
legislation said, that if you can’t reach 
these benchmarks, if you can’t establish 
a civil society, then we will withdraw 
our troops. 

Right now, under President Bush’s 
proposal under Secretary Rice’s proposal, 
what we see as the only people 
paying the price are the American soldiers. 
Those are the only people paying 
the price tonight. 

Today marks a sad anniversary for this, 
country. 

Four years ago today, President Bush declared 
that the mission in Iraq was accomplished 
and that major combat operations in 
Iraq were over. 

Since that time, 24,270 U.S. soldiers have 
been wounded, 3,212 have been killed, and 
the country has descended into a bloody civil 
war that we cannot stop nor should we referee. 


It is time for America to redeploy it’s troops 
from Iraq. 

That’s why today, Congress sent a bill to 
the President’s desk that would do just that: to 
redeploy from Iraq. 

It’s what a majority of the American people 
want, and it’s what a majority of the United 
States Congress wants. 

But instead of ending the war, the President 
is pursuing a war with no end in sight. 

He refuses to hold the Iraqi government accountable 
for the benchmarks it promised to 
achieve: to establish a government supported 
by its people that can provide for its own security. 


In January, the President said that ‘‘If the 
Iraqi Government does not follow through on 

its promises, it will lose the support of the 
American people.’’ 

Well Mr. President, the Iraqi’s have not followed 
through, and your war has lost the support 
of the American people and a majority of 
the United States Congress. 

According to a study by the Brookings Institute, 
there has been ‘‘no progress thus far’’ 
achieving the administration’s benchmarks. 

Yet, despite the President’s promise in January 
to ‘‘hold the Iraqi Government to the 
benchmarks it has announced,’’ the administration 
has flip flopped. 

On Sunday, Secretary Rice said the administration 
believes that holding the Iraqis accountable 
‘‘doesn’t allow us the flexibility and 
creativity that we need to move this forward.’’ 

You can be creative as you want, but unless 
the Iraqis know that there are consequences 
to not living up to their end of the bargain, 
American Soldiers, taxpayers will continue to 
make all of the sacrifices and bear all the 
costs. And that is unacceptable. 

Optimism is not a strategy. Ignoring the 
facts and misleading the country is not a path 
to victory. 

It is time for the Iraqi’s to be held accountable, 
and to take charge of their own country. 

And it is time that the President yield to the 
will of the Nation, and end our occupation of 
Iraq now. 

f 

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED 
ANNIVERSARY 

(Ms. LEE asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 
minute.) 

Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago, 
President Bush stood on the deck of 
the USS Abraham Lincoln, in front of a 
banner that said ‘‘Mission Accomplished,’’ 
and told us that a major combat 
operation had ended. Since then, 
3,200 United States troops have died in 
Iraq, and almost 25,000 have been 
wounded, and countless Iraqis. 

The President has said that he will 
veto a bill very shortly that sets a goal 
for ending the occupation of Iraq signaling 
his insistence on an open-ended 
commitment to a failed policy. Rather 
than change course, the administration 
offers only increasingly desperate rhetoric 
about victory and surrender. 

The fact is, you cannot win an occupation 
just as there is no way that the 
United States can win a civil war. The 
American people recognize that this 
failed policy is making our Nation and 
the world less safe, even if the Bush administration 
refuses to recognize this. 

Mr. Speaker, the American people 
are squarely behind our efforts to end 
the occupation of Iraq and to bring our 
troops home, and history will record 
the President’s veto of those efforts 
with the same ridicule as it does his remarks 
4 years ago. 

f 

INCREASED TERRORIST ATTACKS 
AND THE WAR ON TERROR 

(Mr. BISHOP of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 

Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
the Country Reports on Terrorism 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4261 

released by the State Department yesterday 
indicate that terrorist attacks 
increased by 25 percent last year, and 
more than 40 percent more people were 
killed. In these most dangerous times, 
this tells us we can’t afford to take our 
focus off the global war on terror. Still, 
exactly 4 years after the President proclaimed 
mission accomplished aboard 
the USS Abraham Lincoln, his failed 
Iraq policy persists in overextending 
our armed forces and in refusing to 
compel Iraq to take responsibility for 
their own security and future. 

Today, when the President vetoes 
withdrawal provisions supported by a 
majority of Americans, he places another’s 
obstacle in the way of what 
should be our priority mission, winning 
the global war on terror. We know the 
administration’s stay-the-course policy 
in Iraq is a failure. We know it has 
taken our eye off the war on terror. 

Now we have the numbers to back up 
that statement and the proof we need 
to stop the President from 
compounding this Nation’s single 
greatest foreign policy mistakes. I encourage 
my colleagues to consider the 
hard and irrefutable evidence by the 
State Department, thereby advancing 
our withdrawal from Iraq. 

f 

OUR TROOPS NEED FULL FUNDING 
(Mr. STEARNS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, 
the Senate gave overwhelming 
unanimous consent for General 
Petraeus to implement his strategy in 
Iraq. We all agree, on both sides of the 
aisle, he is the best we have. In fact, he 
has written a manual dealing with terrorists. 
So why do the Democrats want to 
withdraw funds to support him starting 
the first of July? Even as we speak, the 
troops have to reallocate funds and 
prioritize their missions, because they 
don’t have the full funding. In fact, 
they will run out of money shortly. So 
why do the Democrats not allow General 
Petraeus to do his job? General 
Petraeus intends to report back in September 
with a complete report on how 
we are doing. That is a very short 
amount of time, in fact, 5 months 
away. 
He deserves a chance, and he deserves 
full funding for this Congress through 
the fiscal year 2007. So I urge Congress, 
after the President vetoes this bill, to 
come back and give a clean bill so that 
the President can get full funding for 
our troops, at least through fiscal year 
2007. 

f 

THE PRESIDENT’S PLAN DOESN’T 
WORK, SIGN THE BILL 

(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend her remarks.) 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, that’s the value of this great 

country, it is that the will of the people 
can be heard by those of us who 
represent them. The will of the people 
always will be to bring our soldiers 
home. 

It’s interesting that our colleagues 
are talking about funding that doesn’t 
exist when they know full well that 
there is funding until July of 2007 minimally. 
But, really, the message of the 
Democrats, the legislation of the 
Democrats, is not to micromanage, it 
is a bill that this President, who declared 
victory 4 years ago on an aircraft, 
should sign, because it leaves the 
logistics of the war to the generals, but 
it indicates that the people have spoken, 
it’s time to bring our troops 
home. 

Does this body recognize that the 
Maliki government has begun to purge 
generals trained by this United States 
military, who have shown themselves 
to be balanced and fair, who have 
shown them themselves to fight 
against insurgents. The Maliki government 
is a complete collapse, it is a failure. 


It is time now to reorder the government 
to allow allies that are in the 
surrounding areas to work. It is important 
for Secretary Rice to be in Iran, 
to talk to those in Iran and to make 
sure that we have a plan that works. 
The President’s plan doesn’t work. 
Sign the bill.

HONORING JACK VALENTI 

(Mr. TOWNS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise this 
evening to say farewell to a great 
friend and a great American, Jack Valenti, 
who passed away last Thursday. 

When Jack spoke, people listened. 
His soaring eloquence and remarkable 
intellect made this town a better place 
and all of us better legislators. How 
lucky we were to know him and to 
have him as a resource and a friend. 

Jack served in President Lyndon 
Johnson’s administration, and made 
his name and reputation early. Jack 
quickly became known as a hard worker, 
making friends with both Democrats 
and Republicans alike. When 
Jack resigned his White House position 
and became president of the Motion 
Picture Association of America, his 
star really began to shine. 

We are going to miss Jack Valenti, a 
person that had the ability to bring 
people together, a person that had the 
ability to let people understand that 
we all need each other. 

Jack, we are going to miss you, but I 
am certain you will be screening pictures 
in heaven.

SPECIAL ORDERS 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania). 

Under the Speaker’s announced policy 
of January 18, 2007, and under a previous 
order of the House, the following 
Members will be recognized for 5 minutes 
each. 

f 

LISA BEAULIEU—TEXAS POLICE 
OFFICER 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a 
previous order of the House, the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. POE) is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 

Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, peace officers 
are the last strand of wire in the fence 
between the law and the lawless. They 
do society’s dirty work for us. They are 
a cut above the rest of us because of 
who they are and what they do. 

For Lisa Beaulieu, becoming a police 
officer was her life’s ambition. She 
wanted to protect and serve the citizens 
of the community that she loved. 
Lisa worked hard at becoming a peace 
officer, and it didn’t come easy for her. 
To gain experience, she worked as a 
jailer in Dayton, Texas while putting 
herself through the police academy at 
Lamar Institute of Technology. And 
when she graduated, Lisa got a job as a 
dispatcher at the Beaumont Police Department. 
To gain more experience as a 
law enforcement officer, Lisa became 
an unpaid part-time reserve officer 
with the Kountze Police Department in 
Texas. After years of determination, 
Lisa was hired by the Beaumont Police 
Department as a patrol officer in 2001. 

For 6 years, Officer Lisa Beaulieu 
was, as many officers are, the first line 
of defense between the good and the 
evil of our community. She was dedicated 
to her job, and she took it seriously. 
Friends of Lisa stated that, 
when off duty, she was a girly girl. She 
loved the color pink, she always had 
manicured nails and pedicured toes, 
and had a closet full of shoes. Lisa had 
a smile that could light up a room and 
a great sense of humor, often telling 
men that would hit on her that she was 
just a driver’s education instructor. 
She was dedicated to the family she 
had and her friends, and she cherished 
the moments she spent with them. She 
was also an avid animal lover, housing 
two dogs that she adopted from the 
animal shelter. 

During the devastation of Hurricane 
Rita, Lisa took care of the citizens of 
Beaumont and her law enforcement 
family. She worked long, tireless 12-
hour days, patrolling the hurricane’s 
aftermath and caring for the residents 
of Beaumont. For her fellow officers, 
she turned her own garage into a 
makeshift shelter, offering them a 
place to come and get some rest before 
heading back into the disaster zone. 

Friends stated that when she put on 
her uniform, however, she was all business. 
She was fearless and Texas tough, 
invincible when she wore the badge of a 
peace officer. Known as the type of officer 
who would set an example for others, 
Lisa’s police file was filled with 
commendations from Chief Tom Scofield. 



H4262 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

Around 1 a.m. Friday morning, April 
27, the seasoned Officer Beaulieu responded 
to the scene of a motorcycle 
accident on the Eastex Freeway in 
Beaumont. She began directing traffic 
around the accident, allowing motorists 
to pass. While controlling the accident 
scene and out of the darkness of 
the night, a car driven by 24-year-old 
Willie McCray slammed into Officer 
Beaulieu, knocking her over the guard 
rail and onto the road below, killing 
her. She became the first female police 
officer in Southeast Texas killed in the 
line of duty. 

Mr. Speaker, this is a photograph of 
Lisa Beaulieu. The Beaumont Texas 
community was stunned by the loss of 
this veteran peace officer. Some news 
reports, however, have tried to portray 
the person who ran over Lisa as the 
victim instead of her. McCray was not 
the victim, he was the offender. 
McCray’s driver’s license was suspended 
and he had no liability insurance. 
He had been arrested eight times 
for minor crimes. And the worst part, 
McCray was allegedly drunk and believed 
to be high on marijuana when he 
was blasting down the road. McCray 
has been charged with the intoxicated 
manslaughter in the death of this 
peace officer of Texas. He robbed the 
Beaumont community and Officer 
Beaulieu’s family of a dedicated law officer. 


Yesterday, I had the honor to attend 
her funeral, where over 1,000 citizens, 
law enforcement officers, firefighters, 
emergency personnel throughout 
Southeast Texas were all in attendance 
showing their support for their fallen 
comrade. The peace officers present 
wore a black ribbon of sorrow across 
their badges as they paid a last farewell 
to Lisa Beaulieu. 

Mr. Speaker, Officer Beaulieu exemplified 
what it meant to be a peace officer. 
She was a protector of the innocent, 
the community, and her fellow 
peace officers. Officer Beaulieu wore 
the badge with pride, honor, and courage. 
The people and peace officers of 
Texas are saddened by the loss of one 
of their dedicated servants. 

As a former Texas judge, I have 
known a lot of peace officers in my 
day, and some of them were superior 
peace officers. Lisa was one of those superior 
officers. Officers like Lisa 
Beaulieu serve us well and are on duty 
in the middle of the night so that the 
rest of us can sleep with safety and security. 


And that’s just the way it is.

HONORING JACK VALENTI 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a 
previous order of the House, the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. CONYERS) is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CONYERS. Members of the 
House, I rise today to express my gratitude 
for having known and worked 
with Jack Valenti, who passed away 
last week after a lifetime that included 
serving as a pilot in the United States 

Army Air Corps, flying 51 combat missions 
as the pilot commander of a B–25 
attack bomber, a man who was a senior 
aide in the Lyndon Baines Johnson 
White House, serving as the first special 
assistant to President Lyndon 
Johnson, and as president of the Motion 
Pictures Association of America. 

In 2004, Mr. Valenti reflected on his 
extraordinary career when he said, 
‘‘I’m the luckiest guy in the world, because 
I spent my entire public working 
career in two of life’s classic fascinations, 
politics and Hollywood. You 
can’t beat that,’’ he said. 

Nothing about Jack Valenti was average. 
He started his adult life as an 
Army B–25 pilot in World War II, flying 
many combat missions over Italy. He 
returned from the war with numerous 
decorations, including the Distinguished 
Flying Cross and the Air Medal 
with four clusters representing additional 
awards. 

After the war, while working full 
time, Jack Valenti earned a Bachelor 
of Arts from the University of Houston, 
and then went on to Boston where he 
earned a Master of Business Administration 
from Harvard University. 

Known as one of the most influential 
lobbyists in Washington, he headed the 
Motion Picture Association for 38 
years. During that time, I had the opportunity 
to work with him on a number 
of projects, including the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act, which ensured 
protection for intellectual property 
in order to allow the rollout of 
digital technology. Mr. Valenti is also 
well known for creating the film rating 
system which assigned for the first 
time a rating to films. In other words, 
he created a system that would let 
them voluntarily categorize their films 
rather than requiring that we do it by 
legislation. 

His political career was by no means 
mundane, either. Before he went to the 
Motion Picture Association, he served 
as the first special assistant to President 
Johnson, and was in the motorcade 
on November 22, 1963 when President 
Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. 
He then boarded Air Force One 
with President Johnson and was there 
for the famous picture of President 
Johnson being sworn in, and he became 
President Johnson’s special assistant. 

After a lifetime of achievement, 
while most people would be more than 
ready to retire, Jack Valenti turned 
his energy toward a cause he had been 
concerned about for many years, and 
began leading in the fight against HIV 
and AIDS. He became president of the 
nonprofit Friends of the Global Fight, 
whose main goal is to support the global 
fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and 
malaria. Thankfully, we will all be able 
to read about Jack’s enormous accomplishments 
and fascinating life, because 
he just finished his memoir before 
passing, which is entitled, ‘‘This 
Time, This Place: My Life in War, the 
White House and Hollywood.’’ It will 
soon be published. 

While most people with this amount 
of influence may be too busy for many, 

Jack Valenti defied this stereotype by 
continuing to be both a mentor and 
friend to almost everyone with whom 
he came in contact. He kept his promises, 
promptly returned phone calls, 
and is described as generous, loyal, and 
honest by those who knew him. It is an 
understatement to that say Jack Valenti 
will be sorely missed.

FORMER U.S. BORDER PATROL 

AGENTS RAMOS AND COMPEAN 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a 
previous order of the House, the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. 
JONES) is recognized for 5 minutes. 

Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, today is the 105th day since a 
great injustice took place in this country. 
On January 17 of 2007, two U.S. 
Border agents entered Federal prison 
to began serving 11-year and 12-year 
sentences respectively. Agents 
Compean and Ramos were convicted 
last spring for shooting a Mexican drug 
smuggler who brought 743 pounds of 
marijuana across our borders into 
Texas. 

These agents never should have been 
prosecuted; yet, the U.S. Attorney’s Office 
prosecuted the agents and granted 
immunity to the drug smuggler. The illegal 
drug smuggler, who received full 
medical care in El Paso, Texas, was 
permitted to return to Mexico and is 
suing the Border Patrol for $5 million 
for violating his civil rights. Mr. 
Speaker, that is a joke. He is not an 
American citizen, he is a criminal. 

The same U.S. Attorney’s Office in 
Western Texas also prosecuted another 
law enforcement officer, Deputy Sheriff 
Gilmer Hernandez, who was doing 
his job to protect the American people. 

b 1815 
This makes no sense. Mr. Speaker, 
citizens across this country, and many 
of us in Congress want to know why 
does a Federal prosecutor in Western 
Texas choose to go after law enforcement 
officers while protecting illegal 
aliens who commit crimes? 
The American people have not forgotten 
Agents Ramos and Compean, 
who should have been commended instead 
of indicted. I am encouraging 
citizens across this Nation to continue 
calling the White House and ask the 
President to use his authority to immediately 
pardon these two heroes. 
Many of us in Congress are concerned 
about the Federal prosecutor in this 
case and the justification for the criminal 
charges brought against these 
agents. 
Mr. Speaker, Senate Judiciary Chairman 
PATRICK LEAHY has already approved 
Senator DIANE FEINSTEIN’S request 
for an investigation of this case. 
And in recent testimony before the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney 
General Gonzalez promised to fully cooperate 
with an oversight hearing on 
the agents’ case. 
I want to thank Mr. Greg Barnes on 
the staff of the House Judiciary Committee 
for taking time last week, at 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4263 

my request, to meet with Mrs. Monica 
Ramos, the wife of Agent Ramos and 
his father, her father-in-law, Mr. Joe 
Loya. 

I also appreciate that Chairman JOHN 
CONYERS took time to say hello to Ms. 
Ramos and her father. 

Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged that 
the House Judiciary Committee is seriously 
looking at holding hearings to 
investigate the injustice committed 
against these border agents. And that 
is why it is so important, Mr. Speaker, 
that the House look seriously at what 
happened to these men, who should be 
rewarded for trying to protect the 
American people, not serving time in a 
Federal prison. 

Mr. CONYERS. Will the gentleman 
from North Carolina yield to me? 

Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Yes, 
sir, I’d be delighted to yield to the 
chairman. 

Mr. CONYERS. First of all, I wanted 
to congratulate the gentleman on the 
persistence and integrity with which 
he has followed this matter. 

I have had this brought to my attention. 
I did have an opportunity to meet 
with some of the family, and I want to 
assure you that we are coordinating 
our activities with the Senate Judiciary 
Committee with those of my House 
Judiciary Committee; and I promise to 
keep you fully apprised as this matter 
moves forward. 

I congratulate you, not just for what 
you have done for these two officers, 
but what you have done for law enforcement 
officers across this country. 
It’s important that the kinds of concerns 
you have raised are known to all 
of our men and women who carry 
badges and weapons defending us, not 
just at borders, but in every State in 
the Union. 

I thank you from the bottom of my 
heart. 

Mr. JONES of North Carolina. I 
thank the chairman. You are very generous, 
and thank you so much.

MISSION NOT ACCOMPLISHED 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a 
previous order of the House, the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. WOOLSEY) 
is recognized for 5 minutes. 

Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, tonight 
I rise to commemorate an important 
event in the ongoing occupation of 
Iraq. On May 1, 2003, 4 years ago today, 
President Bush, the Commander in 
Chief, strode across the deck of the 
USS Abraham Lincoln and declared that 
the United States mission in Iraq was 
accomplished. 

Mission accomplished. Mission accomplished? 
I don’t think so. Let’s re


view what has and what has not happened 
in Iraq since May 1, 2003. 

American troops were not met in the 
streets with flowers as welcoming liberators. 
Instead, they’ve met with sniper 
attacks and IEDs. 3,351 American 
servicemen and women have given 
their lives, and nearly 25,000, probably 
more, have returned home seriously 
wounded. 

This administration has hidden the 
caskets of those who have perished, 
and forced the wounded to rehabilitate 
in mold-infested, rotting facilities. Are 
those actions of a grateful Nation? 
Does this mean mission accomplished? 

What about the weapons of mass destruction? 
Where are they? Nobody 
knows. Even former head of the CIA, 
George Tenet, is now backing away 
from his ‘‘slam dunk’’ comment. 

Yellow cake? Aluminum tubes? Al 
Qaeda ties to Saddam? An ousted CIA 
agent and a jail term for a senior administration 
official? It is as if this administration 
has been living in Alice’s 
world of Wonderland. 

The mission is yet to be accomplished. 
An accomplished mission 
would have brought peace and democracy 
to the Iraqi people. Neighborhoods 
would be free, not walled off, and a 
bomb would not have been set in the 
Iraqi Parliament building. 

Estimates range upward from 50,000 
Iraqis killed and tens of thousands of 
refugees fleeing to neighboring countries 
like Syria. This is not how to promote 
peace and democracy. 

Let’s see. Thousands, tens of thousands 
of refugees, and the United 
States allowed 7 or 8 Iraqi refugees into 
our country last month. We’ve made 
all those refugees happen, and we are 
doing nothing to help them. 

It takes a small protection force to 
go to the market in Baghdad, and the 
Secretaries of State and Defense must 
make surprise visits to Iraq because 
their security might not be insured 
otherwise. 

So I have to ask, Mr. Speaker, what 
mission was accomplished? The destruction 
of the Iraqi infrastructure? 
The mass exodus of the educated and 
wealthy from Iraq? The mission of 
alienating the United States on the 
global stage? The rise of hatred in 
countries who might have been our 
ally? 

This is unacceptable, and the American 
people know it. They sent that 
message loud. They sent it clear last 
November, and it echoes unheard in the 
White House. 

What is clear, Mr. Speaker, is that 
this mission is not accomplished. The 
ultimate mission to be accomplished is 
to bring our troops home. Then we can 
say, ‘‘Mission Accomplished.’’

HONORING THE LIFE OF CHIEF 
PETTY OFFICER GREG BILLITER 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a 
previous order of the House, the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. DAVIS) is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 

Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, 
it’s the most solemn duty that I 
have to honor those who have served 
our Nation, those who have answered 
the call of this generation, as us in 
prior generations have, to answer to 
that call to be ready to serve and to deploy. 


I rise today to honor a great American, 
Navy Chief Petty Officer Greg 
Billiter. Greg was a native of Villa 
Hills, Kentucky, a graduate of Covington 
Latin, and a true fan of his 
hometown teams, the Cincinnati Bengals 
and the Cincinnati Reds. 

Greg was tragically killed in action 
in Northern Iraq during combat operations. 
He leaves behind his young son, 
Cooper, a caring wife, loving family 
and a legacy that will be honored for 
generations to come. 

For Cooper, as you grow into a man, 
know that your dad loved you. He was 
a great American. He cared about you 
and he answered the call of this Nation. 


I had the opportunity to visit with 
his family, and they all conveyed similar 
sentiments of a brave, dedicated 
and heroic sailor. 

When I asked his wife, April, about 
Greg she told me that he truly loved 
what he was doing. April said, ‘‘He was 
extremely patriotic, and felt that it 
was important for him to be part of the 
war and to help the other soldiers who 
were serving there.’’ His bravery and 
ultimate sacrifice remind us that they 
were all part of a larger mission. 

His parents told a local newspaper 
that he really felt he was helping to 
make Iraq a safer place, especially for 
the children. As an explosive ordnance 
demolition specialist, he made a tremendous 
difference in the lives of 
many, many civilians, military personnel, 
and especially those children. 
We wonder today how many will grow 
up in the future and have a future because 
of Greg’s call and his willingness 
to answer that call and to go and serve. 
Indeed, his mother said that he loved 
what he was doing. He felt what he was 
doing was right, and he knew that he 
made a difference. 

I stand here today to honor his heroic 
work in Iraq and in the United States 
Navy, and to thank him and his family 
for making that ultimate sacrifice. 
We’ve lost a great American in Greg, 
but his work will live on. Thank you, 
Greg. Thank you April, Cooper, Pat, 
and Barry, for sharing your husband, 
father, and son with our Nation. We are 
forever indebted to him. 

As Jesus spoke in John 15:13, no 
greater love has a man than this, that 
he lay down his lives for his friends. Indeed, 
Greg literally did that every day 
in his work to protect other service 
members, to protect civilians, to make 
a difference. 

Greg’s reputation as a chief was quite 
clear. Many of his fellow shipmates 
came into the funeral and showed a 
strength of solidarity that was impressive 
and moving to this old soldier. 

I have spent many years in uniform 
and been with thousands and thousands 


H4264 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, 
and one thing spoke out clearly 
to me was that Greg epitomized the 
warrior ethos of the civilian who went 
into the military, who answered the 
call of the Nation, who grew in character, 
and was an exemplar in all that 
he did, representing the will of the 
founders of this Nation. 

Indeed, it was clear to me, from his 
sailors, from his family, that he was a 
leader, that he was a mentor, that he 
was a friend, that he was a proud son, 
that he was a loving husband and father. 
He was the epitome of all that we 
call dear and great and honorable in 
this land.

WALL STREET LEAVES MAIN 
STREET BEHIND 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a 
previous order of the House, the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, tonight 
the President of the United States says 
he will veto funding for our troops, for 
veterans health care, and even for victims 
of Hurricane Katrina. He still refuses 
to work with Congress to do what 
is necessary to resolve the quagmire in 
Iraq, and to win the hearts and minds 
of people across the Arab and Islamic 
world. 

His policies are breeding terrorism. 
His policies are forcing higher gasoline 
prices in our country. His policies are 
forcing the import of a billion more 
barrels of petroleum every year into 
our country from the most undemocratic 
regimes in the world, and his 
foreign policies are a total failure. 

Meanwhile, here at home, our economy 
seems to be moving in opposite directions 
at the same time. On Wall 
Street, things have never been better. 
The stock market has record to all 
time records. Last week the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average surpassed 13,000 
points for the first time in history. The 
Standard & Poors index has climbed at 
an annualized rate of 13 to 14 percent 
for the first four months of this year. 
Everything’s coming up roses for the 
investment class. 

But it’s a different story on Main 
Street. Yes, it’s a different story in the 
real world, where our constituents see 
gasoline prices just challenged the $3 a 
gallon mark again. 

The stock market might be soaring, 
but consumer sentiment is in the 
dumper. The Conference Board reported 
last week that consumers confidence 
fell to its lowest level since last 
August. 

Economic growth has slowed. The 
Gross Domestic Product, we learned 

last Friday, increased at a weak 1.3 
percent annual rate for the first quarter 
of this year. 

Traders on the floor of the New York 
Stock Exchange might be irrationally 
exuberant, but families in the Midwest 
are increasingly worried. Chances are, 
they won’t make ends meet this time 
with a home equity loan. 

The National Association of Realtors 
reported today that sales of existing 
homes fell unexpectedly in March to 
their lowest level in 4 years. New construction 
down sharply in the first 
quarter of this year, and late payments 
on subprime mortgages increased by 35 
percent in the first quarter of this 
year. 

The foreclosure crisis that has hit 
Ohio and Michigan very hard threatens 
to spread to other parts of our economy. 
So much is clear, the housing 
bubble has burst. 

Paul Krugman, the economist and 
New York Times columnist wrote 
about this ‘‘economic disconnect’’ between 
Wall Street and Main Street in 
yesterday’s edition. He started by 
quoting Edward Lazear, Chairman of 
the Council of Economic Advisor who 
says what’s good for corporations is 
good for America. 

b 1830 
And workers will benefit from this 
growth in productivity. The problem 
with that is it’s not true. High profits 
haven’t led to high investment. Rising 
productivity hasn’t led to high wages. 
And I might add free trade agreements 
haven’t led to free trade. 
Even the investment banking company, 
Morgan Stanley, unwittingly acknowledged 
this brutal fact. In a recent 
newsletter, Joseph McAlinden, 
their chief global strategist, bragged 
with a laughable chart that wages have 
soared 4 percent at an annual rate. 
Well, when wages soar at 4 percent, 
barely keeping pace with inflation, 
what happens when you discount for 
prices? I doubt that if stocks were soaring 
by 4 percent that he would say it is 
a great thing. I guess it all depends on 
your perspective. Median workers’ 
earnings adjusted for inflation have 
been static since this President took 
office, and the economy feels anything 
but great to most Americans. They 
would say, ‘‘Show me the money.’’ The 
fact is, on Main Street, wages have 
barely kept pace with inflation, and 
workers, if they are lucky enough to 
hold on to their benefits, have to pay 
increasingly larger costs for them. 
Meanwhile, corporate profits have 
more than doubled since 2000. And according 
to Krugman, corporate profits 
as a share of national income reached 
their highest levels in American history 
last year. 
That is what happens when productivity 
increases while wages remain 
static. Corporate profits soar and stock 
prices follow but not workers’ wages. 
Wall Street reaches record heights because 
companies are turning around 
and reinvesting those profits not in 

new machinery and jobs, but in making 
more money on our outsourced jobs. 

It is time that Main Street holds 
Wall Street accountable.

SALUTING HOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA’S 
PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION 
WEEK AND RECOGNIZING 
NATIONAL SAFE KIDS WEEK 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a 
previous order of the House, the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ) is recognized for 5 minutes. 

Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, public service is among the 
most noble and demanding of professions, 
and excellence in the delivery of 
public service helps to keep the city of 
Hollywood, Florida, strong and prosperous 
and a wonderful place in which 
to live and work. 

The effectiveness and efficiency of 
government depends, in large measure, 
on public employees whose task it is to 
provide, on a daily basis, a broad range 
of services of the quality required and 
expected by the public. Quite often the 
importance of the public service that is 
rendered by public employees and the 
exemplary manner of their performance 
are often forgotten or overlooked. 

Public employees and volunteers, 
through their commitment to excellence 
and diversity of skills, have made 
great contributions to the City of Hollywood 
in areas such as public safety; 
recreational activities; neighborhood 
revitalization; and the delivery of 
water, sewer, and solid waste services. 

The City of Hollywood recognizes the 
contributions made by public employees 
as well as volunteers at all levels of 
city government and finds it fitting to 
set aside a special time to honor and 
thank these dedicated individuals who 
perform such vital roles. 

Public Service Recognition Week is 
being celebrated from May 7 through 
May 13, 2007, and salutes approximately 
1,700 City of Hollywood employees who 
devote their time and talents to public 
service and who ‘‘do whatever it takes’’ 
to help citizens attain a high quality of 
life, and the numerous volunteers who 
contributed approximately 22,632 hours 
of volunteer service. 

To provide even better service to the 
public, the City of Hollywood has committed 
to an organizational cultural 
change to enhance customer service 
and employee involvement and has initiated 
this process through the em-
ployee-guided strategic plan created by 
Hollywood City Manager Cameron D. 
Benson, a wonderful man, I might add. 

With that said, Mr. Speaker, I am 
honored to pay tribute to the City of 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4265 

Hollywood, Florida, in its celebration 
of Public Service Recognition Week. 

Now, Mr. Speaker, additionally, I 
also rise today to recognize National 
Safe Kids Week. This is an issue that is 
near and dear to my heart as a mom 
with three young children. This year 
National Safe Kids Week will be held 
from April 28 through May 6, 2007. That 
is the week that we are in now. National 
Safe Kids Week is a joint partnership 
between Safe Kids Worldwide 
and its founding sponsor, Johnson & 
Johnson. This week of public education 
activities has been held annually for 19 
years and draws much-needed attention 
to accidental childhood injury, a 
leading killer of children 14 and under. 

This year’s National Safe Kids 
Weeks’ theme is ‘‘Make it a Safe Kids 
Summer.’’ The start of summer is 
known by emergency personnel as 
‘‘trauma season’’ since accidental 
deaths and serious injuries to children 
increase dramatically. An average of 17 
children a day, or 2,143 children in 
total, died from May to August, 2004, 
due to injuries, many of which could 
have been prevented. 

Safe Kids Worldwide research indicates 
that five of the most common 
causes of children’s accidental injury 
deaths in summer are drowning, which 
increases 89 percent in the summer 
over the monthly annual average; 
biking, which increases 45 percent; 
falls, which increase 21 percent; motor 
vehicle passenger injuries, which increase 
20 percent; pedestrian injuries, 
which increase 16 percent. 

In fact, almost 60 percent of total 
children’s accidental injury deaths 
from May to August from 2001 to 2004 
came from these risk areas. Events led 
by Safe Kids coalitions are taking 
place in more than 300 communities 
across the Nation in order to educate 
parents and families about how to keep 
kids safe during the summer, especially 
when participating in these activities. 
As my home State of Florida, 
drowning prevention is an important 
concern of mine as a parent and as a 
legislator. In fact, drowning is the 
leading cause of unintentional injury-
related death to children in the summer 
months in Florida. 

My most rewarding victory, Mr. 
Speaker, came from the passage of the 
Florida Residential Swimming Pool 
Safety Act. I was honored to sponsor 
this law as a State legislator, which 
has helped to save countless numbers 
of children from accidental injury and 
drowning in Florida pools. As the majority 
of drownings and near drownings 
occur in residential swimming pools 
and in open water sites, I hope that 
more States work to address water 
safety in their communities. 

Recently I introduced similar Federal 
legislation here in the House of 
Representatives. My legislation, the 
Pool & Spa Safety Act, would provide 
grants to States that pass such comprehensive 
safety laws and also support 
drowning prevention educational programs, 
among other provisions. Along 

with my colleague Representative 
FRANK WOLF, we hope this bill will be 
passed before another ‘‘trauma season’’ 
occurs for our Nation’s children. I encourage 
my colleagues to lend it their 
support. 

I also urge my colleagues to support 
National Safe Kids Week and to work 
with your State or local Safe Kids coalition 
to prevent these accidental injuries 
to children not only in the summer 
months but throughout the year.

INTRODUCING THE DALIT 
RESOLUTION 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a 
previous order of the House, the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. FRANKS) is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 

Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, 
this afternoon I introduced a resolution 
calling for the United States to 
address the ongoing problem of untouchability 
in India. Last December 
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recognized 
the similarities between untouchability 
in his country and Apartheid 
in South Africa. It is now time for 
this Congress, Mr. Speaker, to speak 
out about this ancient and particularly 
abhorrent form of persecution and segregation, 
even if it is occurring in a 
country many consider to be one of 
America’s closest allies. This Congress 
must urge an end to the social discrimination 
and injustice faced by the 
nearly 250 million people known as 
Dalits and Tribals in India. 

Although the Indian constitution 
guarantees fundamental rights and 
freedoms for all Indians, the untouchables 
continue to face widespread social 
and caste injustices. Article 17 of 
the Constitution outlaws untouchability. 
However, despite numerous 
laws enacted for the protection and 
betterment of the Dalits and Tribals, 
they are still considered outcasts in Indian 
society and are treated as such. 

At best, untouchability involves social 
segregation, including separate 
educational facilities and drinking 
water and restaurants. This is a sad 
and familiar tune to many of us familiar 
with the history of our own country. 
At worst, untouchability entails 
widespread violence against untouchable 
women, especially in the form of 
rape with impunity, being targeted for 
abortions, and comprises the majority 
of temple prostitute and women trafficked 
from India. 

The untouchables are poor, Mr. 
Speaker. Their most basic needs are 
not fulfilled, and they face great difficulties 
in accessing employment, education, 
food, and health care. Most are 
among the poorest people on the face of 
the Earth, living on less than $1 per 
day. Moreover, Dalit women are often 
sold into bondage, prostitution, and 
there is an increasing religious persecution 
against the Dalits and untouchables 
who change their faith. In 2005, 
USAID stopped funding an organization 
after it was revealed that they 
were preventing many of these women 

from leaving prostitution. In a recent 
instance, a whole Dalit village was 
forced to leave their tribal land because 
they had converted to Christianity 
in a state that had laws against 
conversion. 

Mr. Speaker, this resolution is a direct 
statement by the United States 
Congress that untouchability is an unacceptable 
practice on the part of 
America’s largest trading partner and 
close ally. We appreciate that Prime 
Minister Singh and many others have 
recognized that this is a serious social 
problem that needs to be confronted, 
and we urge the rest of Indian society 
and American diplomats, aid workers, 
and businesses working in India to do 
the same and to work toward the eradication 
of casted discrimination in 
India. 

This resolution encourages our government 
to work with India to find new 
approaches to an age-old problem. 
Moreover, Mr. Speaker, this resolution 
will ensure that we as a government 
and we as an American people in no 
way encourage or enforce caste discrimination 
and untouchability 
through our policies with India or 
through foreign aid or direct aid in any 
way. 

And I urge my colleagues to join me 
in calling on the Indian government 
and the world community to look with 
compassion upon India’s untouchables 
and reach out to one of the poorest and 
most oppressed peoples on the face of 
the Earth.

H4266 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

THE DEMOCRAT LEADERSHIP’S 
PLAN FOR FAILURE IN IRAQ 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of January 
18, 2007, the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. PRICE) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 

Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate so much the opportunity 
that my leadership has provided in me 
in allowing me to come and share some 
comments this evening on the floor on 
what is truly a momentous and historic 
day for our Nation. 

Within the last hour, as you know, 
Mr. Speaker, I understand that the 
President has fulfilled the promise that 
he made to the American people. That 
is to uphold and preserve and defend 
the Constitution of the United States; 
and in so doing, he has vetoed the legislation 
that was passed by the Democrat 
majority recently, last week, to 
provide not just funding for our troops 
in harm’s way but also to make 535 
commanders in chief here in Congress 
and to spend an extra 20-odd billion 
dollars on what was supposed to be a 
clean, clear definition of the amount of 
resources needed by our troops to keep 
themselves safe and out of harm’s way 
in both Iraq and Afghanistan. So within 
the last hour the President has vetoed 
that legislation, and this Congress 
will take up that veto tomorrow. 

Curiously, today we have had Members 
of the majority party come to the 
floor over and over and over again and 
express a peculiar amount of glee, glee 
that is highlighting their policy of failure 
and their policy of defeat. Frankly, 
I don’t understand it, Mr. Speaker. 
Many of my constituents talked to me 
this past weekend when I was home 
and said they didn’t understand it either. 
It was peculiar from their standpoint 
to understand and difficult to understand 
how the majority party in 
this Congress could believe that abandoning 
our troops in harm’s way was 
an appropriate thing to do. And, consequently, 
I am as perplexed as they 
with the policy that this majority 
party has put in place. 

The policy that they have put in 
place, as is clear to everybody and we 
will talk about that a bit this evening, 
is to ensure defeat and to ensure failure 
of our troops. And it seems to be 
all, all, for politics, which is probably 
as sad and distressing as anything, Mr. 
Speaker. 

b 1845 
The Democrat leadership continues 
to be committed to a plan for failure in 
Iraq, and they seem to be doing it, as I 
say for political points, scoring political 
points, political partnership, political 
grandstanding, whatever you want 
to call it. 
And some might ask, well, how can 
you be so certain of that? Well, Mr. 
Speaker, we get example day after day 
after day. And the most recent example 
is what happened today, and that is, 
that the bill that this Congress passed, 

this majority passed last week to provide 
artificial timelines and specific 
benchmarks for our troops on the 
ground and to add incredible billions of 
dollars of pork to the war supplemental, 
the bill was passed last week, 
and they did not send it to the White 
House until today. Now, the President 
took his responsibility seriously and he 
vetoed that and turned that bill around 
rapidly. 

But why, why, the American people 
are asking, why did it take nearly a 
week to send that bill to the White 
House? Every day that goes by, every 
day that is added on to our troops and 
our military not having the resources 
that they need to be able to protect 
themselves, to be able to continue the 
mission that they have defined, every 
day that goes by that makes it so that 
they have to rob from Peter to pay 
Paul, every day that goes by that 
makes it so that they are unable to repair 
munitions and armaments, every 
day that goes by is costly to our men 
and women in the military, and costly 
in a way that costs lives. And so every 
day that goes by, by design, is a flawed 
policy, is a policy for failure, and is 
clearly a policy that is grounded in politics 
only. 

So the question has to be asked, Mr. 
Speaker, well, why did it take 5 days to 
send that bill to the President? Well, 
what we have seen today is the answer 
to that question; and that is, that the 
other side, the majority party, clearly 
wanted to score their political points, 
to take advantage of a May 1 anniversary 
that they would define, to distort 
that terribly, but to take advantage of 
that anniversary for political points. It 
is sad, Mr. Speaker, it is truly, truly 
very sad. 

I came to the floor last Wednesday, 
when this House passed the bill, and I 
talked about it being a sad and a sobering 
day for America, and a shame. And 
I talked about it being a shame because 
the policy that this majority party has 
adopted is a policy that sends the 
wrong message to our troops, it sends 
the wrong message to our allies, and 
yes, Mr. Speaker, it sends the wrong 
message to our enemies. Because to our 
troops it says that we don’t believe in 
you. We don’t believe you can accomplish 
your mission. We don’t believe 
that you have the ability to do what 
you say you can do. We don’t believe in 
our general that we supported and endorsed 
by unanimous vote in the Senate 
just this year. The message to our 
troops says, ‘‘We don’t believe in you.’’ 

To our allies, the message is one 
that, I think if you look at it seriously, 
Mr. Speaker, is one that nobody would 
want to send. Because what it says to 
our allies is, with this majority party 
you can no longer trust the commitment 
and the word of the United States 
of America. That is what it says to our 
allies. I don’t think that is the message, 
Mr. Speaker, that we ought to be 
sending around the world in this dangerous 
time. 

But probably the most important 
message is the message that it sends to 

our enemies. To our enemies it says, if 
you happen to have a difference with 
the United States of America and you 
believe that the destruction of the 
United States of America is at the core 
of your belief, then all you have to do 
is wait, all you have to do is wait; 
America will give up. That is the 
wrong message, Mr. Speaker. That is 
the wrong message. And it will ultimately 
end up in a more dangerous 
world if it is allowed to succeed. 

If that message is allowed to succeed 
by the policies of this Nation, it will 
ultimately end up in a more dangerous 
world. It will certainly end up in a 
more dangerous Middle East. And it 
will end up, I believe, and many scholars 
and experts in the military believe 
that it will end up causing greater 
amounts of casualties for the American 
people, and certainly for our military 
who will have to engage in a way and 
in a manner that is almost incomprehensible 
to us right now. 

Most of us in this Chamber, who we 
are privileged to serve, but most of us 
have members of the military who have 
come from our district; all of them 
have sacrificed to serve. They have recognized 
the importance of service to 
our Nation. They have stood up and 
they have said, I hear the call. If you 
talk to them, most of them will say 
that they are not in favor of the kind 
of policy that has been adopted by this 
majority party. One of them has been 
very open about that in this letter that 
I am going to read. It comes from a 
Lieutenant Jason Nichols, United 
States Navy, who is serving currently 
in Baghdad, in Iraq. 

The statements by the majority leader 
in the United States Senate recently 
about the war being lost have hit a 
nerve, they have struck a cord on the 
part of our men and women in the military. 
They have struck a cord across 
this Nation, Mr. Speaker. And the cord 
that they have struck is one that says, 
how on earth can we have a majority 
party, a majority leader who makes 
that kind of statement in the middle of 
conflict when our men and women are 
in harm’s way? What kind of leader is 
that? 

This letter, as I say, comes from 
Lieutenant Jason Nichols, United 
States Navy, it is addressed to Senator 
REID. And he says, ‘‘Senator REID, 
when you say we’ve lost in Iraq, I don’t 
think you understand the effect of your 
words. The Iraqis I speak with are the 
good guys here, fighting to build a stable 
government. They hear what you 
say, but they don’t understand it. They 
don’t know about the political game, 
they don’t know about a Presidential 
veto, and they don’t know about party 
politics. But they do know that if they 
help us, they are noticed by terrorists 
and extremists, and they decide to help 
us if they think we can protect them 
from those terrorists. They tell us 
where caches of weapons are hidden. 
They call and report small groups of 
men who are strangers to the neighborhood, 
men that look the same to us but 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4267 

are obvious to them to be a foreign suicide 
cell. 

‘‘To be brief, your words are killing 
us. Your statements make the Iraqis 
afraid to help us for fear we will leave 
them unprotected in the future. They 
don’t report a cache, and its weapons 
blow up my friends in a convoy. They 
don’t report a foreign fighter, and that 
fighter sends a mortar onto my base. 
Your statements are noticed, and they 
have an effect. 

‘‘Finally, you are mistaken when you 
say we are losing. We are winning, I see 
it every day. However, we will win with 
fewer casualties if you will help us. 
Will you?’’ 

Respectfully, Lieutenant Jason Nichols, 
United States Navy. 

Do you hear that, Mr. Speaker? The 
message that we are sending to our 
enemy, as I said, is all you have to do, 
if you oppose the United States, is just 
wait. But it is more than that, isn’t it, 
Mr. Speaker? As Lieutenant Nichols 
said, quote, ‘‘To be brief, your words 
are killing us.’’ Mr. Speaker, who is 
‘‘us’’ in that letter? Who is ‘‘us’’? ‘‘Us,’’ 
Mr. Speaker, are the brave men and 
women who stand up and fight on behalf 
of the United States of America, 
who stand up and defend our liberty 
and our freedom. 

Mr. Speaker, there are some people 
in my district who wonder why the action 
of Members of Congress who will 
make those kinds of statements, why 
that isn’t defined as treason. I get 
asked those questions at home. They 
are tough to answer. They are tough to 
answer. I ask you, Mr. Speaker, why? 
Why? Why do we have leaders that 
make those kinds of statements? 

It is not just members of the military 
that are saying that this policy that’s 
being adopted and the kind of language 
that’s being used are detrimental to 
our Nation and to our alliances and to 
our men and women in harm’s way. 
There are all sorts of press reports and 
press opinions, editorials across this 
Nation that say what on earth are the 
Democrats doing? What on earth is the 
majority party doing? 

The Chicago Tribune described the 
Democrat surrender bill as ‘‘Self-Defeating.’’ 
They had in an editorial on 
the 27th of April, just 4 or 5 days ago, 
‘‘Establishing a timetable now would 
be self-defeating. A new defense secretary 
and a new commander on the 
ground should have time and flexibility 
to see if they can succeed where their 
predecessors failed,’’ which is exactly 
what Americans believe. But there is 
this peculiar glee on the other side of 
the aisle that they are accomplishing 
something for political gain; however, 
that something puts America at greater 
risk. 

The Chicago Tribune goes on to say, 
‘‘President Bush will veto the spending 
bill approved by Congress this week because 
it contains a timetable for withdrawing 
U.S. combat troops from Iraq. 
He is right to do so.’’ Mr. Speaker, this 
isn’t a paper that is known to be terribly 
supportive of this President, but 

they understand the consequences of 
the actions of this majority party, they 
understand that they put us at greater 
risk. 

And finally, the editorial from the 
27th of April from the Chicago Tribune 
goes on to say, ‘‘Establishing a congressionally 
mandated timetable for 
withdrawal would straitjacket the ability 
of General Davis Petraeus, the top 
commander on the ground, to pursue 
the stabilization of Iraq as events and 
conditions warrant. 

‘‘Senator HARRY REID said recently 
the war is lost. This legislation would 
all but guarantee it.’’ 

So in addition to having a certain 
amount of glee with the actions that 
are occurring, Mr. Speaker, I would 
suggest that the Democrat leadership 
in both the Senate and the House is 
vested in the defeat of the United 
States in Iraq. They are now on record 
as being in favor of the defeat of the 
United States. It is a very peculiar 
strategy, Mr. Speaker. And the only 
way it makes sense is if you believe 
that this Congress ought to act for 
short-term political gain by a given political 
party; that is the only way it 
makes sense. No other way could it be 
deemed as being appropriate for the 
policy of this Nation to hamstring, to 
handcuff, to tie the ability of our generals 
on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan 
to make decisions. It seems truly 
that failure and defeat are the goal of 
the majority party. How sad, how sad 
for a once proud party in this Nation to 
have failure for the United States be 
their new strategy. 

The Wall Street Journal sees it similarly. 
They say that Washington Democrats 
are taking ownership of the defeat 
in Iraq. In an editorial on April 25, 
just last month, they say, ‘‘In calling 
for withdrawal, Mr. REID and his allies, 
just as with Vietnam, may think they 
are merely following polls that show 
the public is unhappy with the war. Yet 
Americans will come to dislike a humiliation 
and its aftermath even more, 
especially if they realize that a withdrawal 
from Iraq now will only make it 
harder to stabilize the region and defeat 
Islamist radicals. And they will 
like it even less should we be required 
to re-enter the country someday under 
far worse circumstances.’’ 

It is peculiar, when you think about 
it, Mr. Speaker, because what you hear 
from the other side, what you hear 
from the Democrat majority in all of 
their discussion and all of their points, 
their political partisan points that 
they make about this, all that you 
hear is about this issue of failure. You 
never hear about what the next step is. 

We are going to talk about that a little 
bit tonight, about what the next 
step ought to be, about the consequences 
for failure. Because it is important 
that the American people appreciate 
that the decisions made in 
this Congress will affect this Nation for 
a long period of time if the decisions 
aren’t made in the light of day and 
with eyes wide open about what the 

consequences of failure in this day and 
time in the Middle East will be. 

The Wall Street Journal also went on 
to say, ‘‘At least Mr. Bush and his commanders 
are now trying to make up for 
previous mistakes with a strategy to 
put Prime Minister Maliki’s government 
on a stronger footing, secure 
Baghdad and the Sunni provinces 
against al Qaeda, and allow for an 
eventual honorable U.S. withdrawal. 
That’s more than can be said for Mr. 
REID and the Democratic left, who are 
making the job for our troops more difficult 
by undermining U.S. morale and 
Iraqi confidence in American support.’’ 

b 1900 
It gets to the issue of what kind of 
message, Mr. Speaker, we are sending 
to our allies. 
The San Diego Tribune was another 
paper that weighed in on this issue. 
They went on to describe the Democrat 
surrender bill as ‘‘a sham that is detrimental 
to our efforts.’’ They said, ‘‘The 
Democratic campaign is a textbook 
lesson in why the war cannot be managed 
by a committee of 535 bitterly divided 
lawmakers. The Constitution 
gives Congress control of the Federal 
purse strings, to be sure, but this authority 
has never been an effective instrument 
for directing forces in a combat 
zone. The Constitution gives that 
authority to the commander-in-chief 
alone.’’ 
This brings up the interesting issue, 
Mr. Speaker, of how this Congress can 
believe that it ought to be having 535 
commanders-in-chief. It doesn’t make 
any sense, because it puts every one of 
the Members of Congress who believe 
that they know better what ought to 
go on on the ground in a position that 
ties the hands of our generals. 
It is not unusual for the Democrat 
party to believe that Congress knows 
best. Oftentimes their decisions affect 
people in kind of peripheral and tangential 
ways. In this decision, Mr. 
Speaker, it affects our military men 
and women who are putting themselves 
in harm’s way very directly and adversely. 
Now, I want to be clear that those of 
us in the Republican Party believe that 
this is an appropriate debate for Congress 
to have. It is appropriate for Congress 
to say, as the paper that I just 
cited says, that Congress has the power 
of the purse string, and it is appropriate 
for Congress to say, if it so desires, 
if the majority party so desires, 
that we ought not fund the troops anymore 
in Iraq or in Afghanistan or wherever 
else this majority party deems 
that it is not appropriate for us to fund 
troops. That is an appropriate debate. 
That is a clear debate, that is a clear 
vote, which is why we asked for a clear 
vote, a clean vote, on the war supplemental. 
Because, Mr. Speaker, when 
that happens, then it is very clear what 
people are voting upon. That, yes, we 
believe there ought to be resources 
available for our men and women in 
harm’s way; or, no, we do not. That is 
a clear vote. 


H4268 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

We muddy the waters and we confound 
the issue and we do a disservice 
to our Constitution and we do a disservice 
to our men and women in the 
field, certainly, when we put arbitrary 
timelines and benchmarks in a bill 
that clearly, clearly, is not appropriate, 
and makes it so that the Constitution 
becomes undermined. 

The San Diego Union Tribune goes on 
to say more on April 26. General 
Petraeus was here, who is the Commander 
of American forces in Iraq on 
the ground. He visited this Congress 
last Wednesday and was not given the 
opportunity to speak to the House of 
Representatives as a whole in this 
Chamber. In fact, it is curious, Mr. 
Speaker, because the Speaker of this 
House went out of her way to visit the 
President of Syria on a visit recently 
to the Middle East, but she didn’t go 
out of her way to visit with the American 
commanding general when he visited 
Congress. 

So, the San Diego Tribune last week 
said, ‘‘Yesterday’s pleas to lawmakers 
by General David Petraeus, the top 
commander in Iraq, not to micromanage 
the war were brushed off without 
serious consideration in the 
House’s partisan stampede. Meanwhile, 
essential funding for the troops has 
been sidetracked by the phony legislative 
exercise playing out on Capitol 
Hill.’’ 

That is what I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, 
that the only rational conclusion 
that one could come to about why we 
are going through this process, why we 
are going through this ‘‘sham bill,’’ as 
the San Diego Union Tribune calls it, 
why we are going through this exercise 
and putting the American people and 
our troops in harm’s way through this 
exercise, is all about politics. It is all 
about politics. How sad, Mr. Speaker. 
How sad. 

The Union Tribune concludes, ‘‘And 
even though this sham bill is merely a 
political show, the Democratic majorities 
in the House and Senate managed 
to lard it up with nearly $25 billion in 
wasteful pork, most of it entirely unrelated 
to war funding.’’ 

So, Mr. Speaker, it is not just our 
men and women in the field who say 
that this is a wrong-headed policy. It is 
not just those of us on the minority 
side of the aisle who say that this is a 
wrong-headed policy and it sends the 
wrong message to our troops and to our 
allies and to our enemies. It is cogent 
individuals across this Nation who 
have come to that same conclusion. 

The opportunity to come to the floor 
is a true privilege and a great opportunity 
to share with the American people 
what our belief is about this supplemental 
war bill, and I am pleased to be 
joined by a colleague, the gentlelady 
from Tennessee, Congresswoman 
BLACKBURN, who is a true leader in this 
House and has been a true leader on 
this issue, because she understands and 
appreciates the importance and the 
consequences of the decisions that we 
make as they relate to our troops in 

the field and as they relate to our Nation 
and to our future liberty and our 
future freedom. 

I am so pleased you would join us 
this evening. I look forward to your 
comments. 

Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Georgia so 
very much. I appreciate his diligence 
on the issue. 

Mr. Speaker, as we have been 
through this issue and with our troops, 
I have got a letter with me tonight 
that I received from one of our men 
and women that is in Baghdad who is 
thanking me for the support and 
thanking so many Members of the 
House for their support in standing 
with them and their families and supporting 
our troops. I think it is so interesting 
how they have viewed this 
and kind of the filter they view this 
issue of our troop funding from. 

As I read that letter and as I have 
been home over the weekend and 
talked to so many of my National 
Guard families, talked to so many of 
the military families that call Tennessee’s 
Seventh District home, one of 
the things that has been mentioned repeatedly 
is, ‘‘Marsha, I hope that people 
in Washington look at this debate 
and that they take a little bit of a historical 
view to this and focus on what 
should be some lessons learned.’’ Because 
there are lots of lessons learned, 
or should be lots of lessons learned in 
this, Mr. Speaker. 

One of the ones that was highlighted 
for me by one of my constituents is 
that we have to realize when you go 
back and you look at the decade of the 
nineties and look at the view that then 
President Clinton took of the military, 
saying, well, the wall has come down. 
Well, we have survived these threats. 
Well, let’s reduce funding to the military. 
Well, let’s reduce funding on intelligence. 
Let’s put it into domestic 
programs, social service programs. 

Then the unintended consequence, I 
am sure he would say, is when you look 
at what happens when you have to go 
back through that rebuilding process. 
When you hear from those in our intelligence 
agencies and in the FBI and the 
CIA that say, my goodness, it takes 5 
years for us to develop an asset in 
these countries. When you hear from 
our men and women in uniform about 
the importance of maintenance, maintenance 
on those posts, maintenance 
on that equipment, R&D and how that 
should have been continued. When they 
point to equipment and artillery that 
didn’t get developed. We have to look 
at that as a lesson learned and realize, 
yes, indeed, you do get peace through 
strength, and you maintain it by being 
certain that you are ever-vigilant and 
that you are always making certain we 
fulfill the constitutional duty to provide 
for the common defense. 

There are lessons learned, and I hope 
that this body does take it seriously, 
and I hope that our friends across the 
aisle will join us and say let’s be fair to 
our military, to those families and to 

those troops, because for the debate 
that has taken place, for the rhetoric 
that has been spewed, for some of the 
statements that have been made, there 
are many of them that can look at this 
and say they are not being fair to us 
and they are not being fair to the job 
that we would do. 

Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentlewoman’s comments. 
I am struck by the general 
sense by the majority party, or seeming 
sense by the majority party, that 
their actions don’t really make any difference 
to date. In fact, the delay we 
have already had, I have heard from 
some folks in the military that they 
are not able to keep up some of the repair 
of some of the equipment in other 
areas, not in the field of war right now, 
but in other areas, which makes us less 
safe as a nation. 

I was wondering if you had anybody 
you talked with who was giving a similar 
story? 

Mrs. BLACKBURN. Yes, and I appreciate 
the gentleman yielding. Yes, indeed, 
we hear this regularly, not only 
from our Guardsmen, but we also hear 
it from those that are on active duty, 
that are moving forward and readying 
for another deployment. They talk 
about how they work to make ends 
meet, and they talk about how deeply 
it hurt the ongoing progress of developing 
different equipment and protocols 
as funding was cut through the 
nineties. 

I think another thing that we have to 
remember, and this has been highlighted 
by a couple of my constituents 
who are so wonderful and love keeping 
up with the issue, is we have to remember 
on September 11, 2001, we were not 
under a George Bush budget. We were 
still under the last Clinton budget. The 
focus was shifting for that budget that 
was going into place on the first of October 
in 2001. 

Actually, Mr. Speaker, I think everybody 
realizes that prior to September 
11, this Nation had responded to acts of 
terrorism as civil disobedience. September 
11, all of that changed and we 
called it what it is, and that is a war. 
Because no one can deny, and I do 
think it is foolhardy to stand and say, 
oh, there is no such thing as a global 
war on terror. Everybody knows there 
is, because they know we have a very 
dedicated, very focused enemy. You 
can listen to their own words. They 
want to annihilate us and end our way 
of life. 

I think it would not be wise for us to 
let that go unattended. We are right to 
respond with diligence and tenacity 
and focus to make certain that we defeat 
the radical Islamic jihadists who 
want to tear our Nation and our communities 
apart by the very fabric that 
holds them together. 

Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate 
those comments, because it is an incredible 
privilege and honor to represent 
a nation where we have men and 
women who are willing to stand up and 
serve, to volunteer to stand up and 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4269 

serve to protect the freedoms that you 
describe, which is why in my district 
people are so confounded by the kind of 
policy that is being pushed by the majority 
party at this point. Because 
what they see is a majority party now 
that is saying to our troops, we don’t 
believe in you, we don’t believe you can 
accomplish your mission. It is saying 
to our allies that you can’t believe in 
the commitment of the United States. 
And it says to our enemies that all you 
have to do is wait. It is very strange 
policy. 

I yield to the gentlewoman. 

Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 

Mr. Speaker, indeed, we see that. The 
message that it sends, actions do speak 
louder than words. We heard that as 
children growing up, ‘‘your actions are 
going to say more about your intent 
than the words that you speak.’’ And 
we know that. 

The message that it is sending by the 
actions is one that does not serve us 
well, in my opinion. It is one that 
causes our intent to be called into 
question, because we know what the 
enemy would do with us if they were 
given the chance. We have to realize 
that we have to be vigilant and we cannot 
let down our guard, not for a 
minute, not for an hour, not for a day. 
We have to continue to work to defeat 
this enemy. 

So many of my constituents have 
called about the bill. I brought a copy 
of the bill today to the floor with me, 
and here it is. It is I think 93 pages 
when we printed the whole thing out. It 
is not that difficult to read. I can even 
read parts of it without my reading 
glasses, the print is big enough, and I 
like that. It makes it a little bit easier 
to focus on. 

b 1915 
For constituents who are watching 
tonight and want to follow along 
through the debate with us, I would encourage 
them, go to thomas.loc.gov. 
That is all you have to enter in your 
search engine. When you get in thomas.
loc.gov to query the site, enter 
‘‘H.R. 1591.’’ That is the number on this 
bill. I do encourage individuals to go in 
and pull this down so they can see what 
is contained in here. 
Now some of the comments that I 
have had, and you mentioned this earlier, 
our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, the Democrat majority, ran 
railing against pork spending. From so 
many of our families I have heard: How 
in the world could they have drafted a 
bill that had money for all of these different 
interests? It sounds like a grocery 
list when you talk about beef and 
cheese and dairy products and spinach 
and shrimp. And when you look at the 
intent or what we have come to believe 
that they want to do, which was not 
put it through PAYGO rules, not put it 
through regular order, but slide it in 
here because they felt this was something 
Members couldn’t refuse to vote 
for. 

How unfair to our troops and our 
military families, to put this on their 
back and saddle them with this $24 billion 
worth of pork barrel spending. It is 
not what they said they were going to 
do; and quite frankly, I don’t think 
that is the kind of change that the 
American people wanted to see. 

Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate 
you bringing up the extra $20-plus billion 
in the bill. And I am not often 
struck by the candor of some of our 
friends in the Democratic Party, but I 
was moved and struck by the candor of 
the chairman of the House Ways and 
Means Committee, Mr. RANGEL, who 
was on one of the Sunday shows. I 
think it was ‘‘Meet the Press’’ with Mr. 
Russert. And Mr. Russert said: Why did 
you put all of that money in the bill? 
And Chairman RANGEL, to his remarkable 
credit of candor said ‘‘because we 
needed the votes.’’ 

So it is clear that the reason that the 
extra $20-plus billion of pork spending 
is in that bill is because, exactly as you 
said, they believe that people won’t be 
able to vote against the bill if that 
kind of pork spending is in it. 

Mrs. BLACKBURN. That is right. It 
is so unfortunate. What we need is a 
clean bill that allows a good debate 
over how we are moving forward in 
Iraq. 

I think it has been striking to see the 
Senate confirm and give a vote of support 
for General David Petraeus who is 
commanding our efforts in Iraq, a very 
scholarly general. He truly is a leader 
for our men and women and for the 
Iraqis. He has great respect from them. 

But then to turnaround and say we 
are going to second guess or Monday 
morning quarterback your decisions 
and we are not going to give the funding 
and we are not going to give it in 
a timely manner. As the gentleman 
from Georgia was so eloquently stating 
earlier, there comes a time when you 
have to look at it and talk about what 
their intent is, and if they even trust 
the troops, if they even trust the commanders 
in the field to have the flexibility 
that they need to respond. 

Certainly today we have seen and 
have noted the demise of al-Masri who 
is the head of al-Qaeda in Iraq. Now I 
know that it is probably a subject that 
the majority doesn’t want to talk 
about, that al-Masri was killed in Iraq, 
had been found there and had been 
working there. So it leads one to ask 
the question: What was he doing in 
Iraq? Why was he in Iraq? And why was 
it that he met his death in Iraq? 

Well, the answer to that question is 
he was there because he and the other 
terrorists and the other terrorist 
groups all tell us the central front of 
the global war on terror is in Iraq. This 
is where they are fighting it. 

Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank you 
once again for pointing out this incredibly 
prescient and clear perspective on 
this issue, if people in the majority 
party would just step back and take a 
look. And that is why it is important 
that you pointed out that the bill num


ber is H.R. 1591 and how to find it on-
line at www.thomas.loc.gov, and I urge 
people to look at the area in the bill 
that has the artificial time lines and 
benchmarks. What we oftentimes hear 
from our friends on the other side of 
the aisle is there is no specific time 
line; but the bill is very specific. It 
says by October 1, we will begin to 
bring the troops home. 

So it is clear that their mission is 
politics. The majority party’s mission 
is politics. There can be no other reason 
for the remarkably foolish, if you 
want to support the United States, the 
remarkably foolish policy that they 
put on the table. The only reason can 
be politics, and short-term politics at 
that. 

Mrs. BLACKBURN. One of the things 
that is so disappointing to me, having 
as many veterans and as many military 
families and members of the military 
as I have in my district, one of the 
things that is disappointing to me is 
they may want to do this over and over 
and over and delay the funding that 
gets to those troops. 

One of the things that it always 
brings to mind, if you don’t want to get 
the money to them and you don’t want 
to get it to them in a timely manner, 
and you want to push benchmarks on 
our troops, then you have to be able to 
answer some questions. You’ve got to 
answer the question: What is going to 
happen if we leave? 

Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Absolutely. 

Mrs. BLACKBURN. What is going to 
happen if we leave Iraq? What are the 
Iraqi people going to do if we leave 
Iraq? What is going to happen in the 
Middle East? 

Somebody asked me earlier today, 
asked me, how many more people have 
to die? I said that is the question to 
ask the terrorists: How many more 
people have to die? 

But what we do know is that we cannot 
let down our guard. We do have to 
continue to fight. We have to realize 
terror and the war on terror is a new 
enemy. They do not have a headquarters. 
They do not show allegiance 
to a country. They do not wear a uniform. 
They are an illusive enemy. 

Right now they are saying the central 
battle front is Iraq. September 11, 
2001, we know where that central battle 
front was. 

Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Exactly. 

Mrs. BLACKBURN. We know. And 
what we have to do is be certain that 
we meet our obligation to our men and 
women in uniform and that we send a 
message to every terrorist that is 
breathing on the face of the earth that 
we will not stop. 

Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the 
gentlelady because it is the question 
that needs to be asked, and it is a question 
that our friends on the other side 
of the aisle asked all the time about 
what the President asked once Saddam 
fell, what next? What we ask them 
now, given our current situation: 
Where is your strategy? If you succeed 
with your policy of ending the funding 


H4270 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

for the troops and ending our involvement 
in Iraq, what next? What happens 
then? 

There are some very good scholarly 
individuals who have looked at this, 
and they have said what they believe 
will happen next. In fact, the chart 
that I have here shows what the National 
Intelligence Estimate, the NIE, 
says will happen if we fail in Iraq. That 
is important because that group, the 
National Intelligence Estimate, is the 
group that our good friends cite all of 
the time, incorrectly, I might add oftentimes, 
but they cite them as the 
source for information about what 
ought to be done in Iraq. 

But what the National Intelligence 
Estimate has said that the consequences 
of failure in Iraq would be: 
‘‘Coalition capabilities, including force 
levels, resources, and operations remain 
an essential, stabilizing element 
in Iraq.’’ Essential stabilizing element 
in Iraq. 

Last week when General Petraeus 
was here and what he said, and it was 
so distorted by our friends on the other 
side of the aisle, but what he said on 
April 26 was: ‘‘As I noted during my 
confirmation hearing, military action 
is necessary but not sufficient. We can 
provide the Iraqis an opportunity, but 
they will have to exploit it.’’ 

He also said: ‘‘And again I note that 
we are just really getting started with 
the new effort.’’ 

He went on to say: ‘‘Success will take 
continued commitment, perseverance 
and sacrifice, all to make possible an 
opportunity for the all-important Iraqi 
political actions that are the key to 
long-term solutions to Iraqi’s many 
problems. And because we are operating 
in new areas and challenging elements 
in those areas, this effort may 
get harder before it gets easier.’’ 

Mr. Speaker, that is the kind of information 
that is imperative for this 
Congress to appreciate and recognize 
and utilize in its formula for where we 
go from here. If we ignore that kind of 
information from our general that was 
unanimously approved by our Senate, 
if we ignore that kind of information, 
we do so at our peril. 

So what happens if we have failure in 
Iraq, according to the National Intelligence 
Estimate, well, one, Iraqi security 
forces would be subject to sectarian 
control. What does that mean? 
That means in essence the nation 
breaks into three warring factions, 
three warring factions, and some would 
say that is what is happening right 
now. The difference is there would be 
no stabilizing influence whatsoever, 
and the estimates are that ten of thousands 
if not hundreds of thousands of 
Iraqis would be slaughtered. Mr. 
Speaker, that is a sobering assessment. 
That is a sobering assessment. 

Secondly, interference by neighboring 
countries in an open conflict is 
what the National Intelligence Estimate 
says is likely with failure in Iraq. 
What does that mean. 

Mr. Speaker, as you well know, what 
that means is that the conflagration, 

the battles, the war in Iraq becomes a 
war in the larger Middle East in a way 
that can only be described as a nightmare 
not just for the Middle East but 
for peace in the world, for peace in the 
world. 

The National Intelligence Estimate 
went on to say there would be massive 
civilian casualties and population displacement, 
as I mentioned before. The 
estimates range from tens of thousands 
to hundreds of thousands of individuals 
slaughtered, killed, murdered, in sectarian 
violence that would put the kind 
of violence that we are seeing right 
now, which is horrendous, but it would 
make it seem like just a prelude, just a 
prelude. 

Fourth, the al Qaeda in Iraq would 
plan increased attacks inside and outside 
Iraq. 

This is important because if al 
Qaeda, if in the larger war on terror 
which we sometimes or oftentimes in 
this Chamber seem to lose sight of, but 
if in the larger war on terror the terrorists, 
the Islamic terrorists whose 
stated desire is to wipe Israel off the 
map and to end our way of life, that is 
their stated desire, not my opinion, 
that is their stated desire. If we fail in 
Iraq, what results is a haven of significant 
size and significant ability to attract 
terrorists in a way and to allow 
them the opportunity to plot for significant 
violence and attacks both inside 
and outside Iraq. 

Mr. Speaker, as we saw outside Iraq 
doesn’t just mean next door. It means 
around the world. As we saw on September 
11, around the world can mean 
violence and horrendous activities visiting 
our shores when we least expect 
it. 

Finally, the National Intelligence Estimate 
says there will be spiraling violence 
and political disarray, including 
Kurdish attempts at autonomy in 
Kirkuk. What that means is the nation 
breaks apart. And if Iraq breaks apart 
in the way that the National Intelligence 
Estimate has stated would be 
the likely outcome of failure in Iraq, if 
that nation breaks apart, what happens 
is it becomes a magnet for terrorism 
and a terrorist haven in the Middle 
East, a less stable Middle East, a more 
endangered Middle East, an 
emboldened enemy, a likely scenario 
that would bring about significant violence 
upon our shores once again. 

b 1930 
So, Mr. Speaker, the consequence of 
the actions that have been adopted by 
this majority party, by this bill that 
the President has vetoed this evening, 
the consequences of moving forward 
with that same kind of legislation, 
which the majority party has threatened 
to do, and ‘‘threatened’’ is the 
right term because it threatens to 
place, Mr. Speaker, at greatest risk 
and in greater harm’s way, if we continue 
along that path, what we do is 
bring about a less stable Middle East, 
certainly a less stable Iraq, a greater 
threat to Israel and other Nations in 

the Middle East and certainly a greater 
threat to the United States. 

I was quoting earlier, Mr. Speaker, 
from some news reports and newspapers 
from around the Nation on what 
they believed was the essence of this 
bill that the President has appropriately 
vetoed this evening. 

The Washington Times said that, 
‘‘The Democrats’ lack of interest in the 
real-world impact of their legislation is 
reflected in their shabby treatment of 
the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, 
Lieutenant General David Petraeus. 
Last week, House Democratic leaders 
initially declined General Petraeus’ invitation 
to brief Members, reversing 
themselves only after coming under 
fire from Republicans. And by tying 
funding for the war to a surrender bill 
that the President will veto, the Democrats 
are showing studied contempt for 
our troops in the field.’’ 

Studied contempt, Mr. Speaker, 
which brings me back to the original 
letter that I read from Lieutenant 
Jason Nichols, who clearly appreciates 
this studied contempt, but also takes it 
to the next step and describes what 
that studied contempt does. I quote 
Lieutenant Nichols once again, ‘‘To be 
brief, your words are killing us.’’ 

A powerful statement, Mr. Speaker, 
and we ought to be listening. We ought 
to be listening to the brave men and 
women who stand up to defend our liberty. 


The Washington Times went on to 
say on April 26, ‘‘When it came to the 
150,000 U.S. troops now fighting in Iraq, 
lawmakers included enough poison-pill 
language to ensure a presidential veto 
which will in turn delay much-needed 
support for military operations in 
Iraq.’’ 

In another paragraph in that same 
article on April 26, ‘‘To satisfy the 
MoveOn.org types, particularly in the 
House, the bill stars the pullout as 
early as nine and a half weeks from 
now. In an effort to provide political 
cover for House ‘Blue Dogs’ from more 
conservative districts who want to vote 
with Mrs. Pelosi, it contains troop-
withdrawal language that sets a ‘goal’ 
for pulling out rather than a deadline.’’ 

However, Mr. Speaker, if you read 
the bill H.R. 1591, what it states, indeed, 
is a hard and fast deadline. 

I want to quote one more individual 
who has stood tall and taken a lot of 
heat for it, and this is Senator JOSEPH 
LIEBERMAN who last week wrote in the 
Washington Post that the Democrat 
surrender bill is ‘‘dangerously wrong.’’ 

He went on to say, ‘‘And today, perversely, 
the Senate is likely to vote on 
a binding timeline of withdrawal from 
Iraq. This reaction is dangerously 
wrong. It reflects a fundamental misunderstanding 
of both the reality in 
Iraq and the nature of the enemy we 
are fighting there. What is needed in 
Iraq policy is not overheated rhetoric 
but a sober assessment of the progress 
we have made and the challenges we 
still face.’’ 

He went on to say on April 25 of this 
year, ‘‘Indeed, to the extent that last 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4271 

week’s bloodshed clarified anything, it 
is that the battle of Baghdad is increasingly 
a battle against al Qaeda. 
Whether we like it or not, al Qaeda 
views the Iraqi capital as a central 
front of its war against us.’’ 

Finally in that article, Mr. Speaker, 
Senator LIEBERMAN said, ‘‘In the two 
months since Petraeus took command, 
the United States and its Iraqi allies 
have made encouraging progress on 
two problems that once seemed intractable: 
tamping down the Shiite-led sectarian 
violence that paralyzed Baghdad 
until recently and consolidating support 
from Iraqi Sunnis, particularly in 
Anbar, a province dismissed just a few 
months ago as hopelessly mired in insurgency.’’ 


So, Mr. Speaker, where do we go from 
here? Well, I think that it is time for 
the majority party to regroup, to reassess, 
to appreciate that what they have 
done is spent four months on a policy 
that is candidly shameful; that brings 
about a discredit and a disservice to 
our troops; that sends the wrong message 
to our allies saying that you cannot 
trust the United States of America; 
and certainly sends the wrong message 
to our enemies saying that if you oppose 
the United States and you are in 
a conflict, all you have got to do is 
wait because the United States will not 
live up to its commitment. 

So, Mr. Speaker, what we need to do 
from here, the President has vetoed 
this bill this evening. I would challenge 
the leadership in the majority party to 
bring the House together. I would challenge 
the Senate to work together in a 
bipartisan way and come up with a bill 
that the President can sign and to do 
so in very rapid fashion. Every day 
that we delay makes it more harmful 
for our troops, makes it so they know 
not whether or not they will get the resources 
that they need to carry on 
their mission, makes it less predictable, 
continues to erode their morale 
because of the comments like the ones 
by the Senate majority leader last 
week. So we must in short order come 
together and pass a bill that the President 
can sign. 

Mr. Speaker, regardless of what you 
believe, what one believes about the 
nature of this battle and whether or 
not it is indeed the central front of the 
war on terror, it is incumbent that we 
live up to our responsibilities, to our 
oath as Members of the United States 
House of Representatives, that we live 
up to the responsibility and the duty 
that we have. That primary responsibility 
is to preserve and to protect and 
to defend the United States. 

I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that 
one of the issues about preserving and 
protecting and defending the United 
States is making certain that the men 
and women who stand up and volunteer 
to protect our liberty and our freedom 
deserve all of our support and the resources 
that they require to protect 
themselves and to carry out their missions. 


So, Mr. Speaker, I challenge the leadership 
of the House and the Senate to 

make certain that this week we act to 
bring forth a bill that will pass both 
chambers of this Congress, and that 
the President can sign, that does a 
credit and honors our troops; that 
sends the correct message to our allies, 
and that is, that you can count on the 
word of the United States of America; 
and sends the correct message to our 
enemies, and that is, that if you engage 
the United States in military battle, 
that you have met an enemy that you 
cannot defeat. 

f 

30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
COHEN). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 18, 2007, the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. MEEK) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee 
of the majority leader. 

Mr. MEEK of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
it is an honor to come before the 
House once again, especially this 
evening. 

As you know, the 30-Something 
Working Group, we come to the floor 
to bring forth the truth on behalf of 
the American people, not just Independents 
or not just Democrats, not 
just Republicans, but on behalf of the 
American people. 

I am so glad to be joined once again 
by my good friend from Niles, Ohio, 
Mr. TIM RYAN, and I am always excited 
about being on the floor with him. I am 
excited by the fact that, Mr. Speaker, 
today that there was a conference report 
signed to support our men and 
women that are in harm’s way in Iraq, 
Afghanistan, and in areas where they 
are staging to move into theater, one 
that brings about the equipment and 
support, going above and beyond what 
the President called for, but it also had 
benchmarks to bring about the kind of 
standards that the American people are 
crying out for. 

It happened today at 3 p.m., and I am 
very proud of not only the Speaker but 
Majority Leader HARRY REID over in 
the Senate, Senator REID. I think it is 
also important for us to realize that in 
both chambers it passed by a bipartisan 
vote. I think it is also important 
to note that as soon as we were able to 
get that conference report signed, that 
the President, one of his first actions 
was to announce officially his veto of 
that legislation, saying tomorrow that 
Democrats and Republicans will come 
together at the White House to discuss 
where we can compromise. 

Let me just say this before I yield to 
Mr. RYAN. I understand that there is a 
discussion that is going on about who 
is right and who is wrong, but I think 
it is very, very important to understand 
especially on the date that Mr. 
RYAN is going to address in a minute, 
some 4 years ago, where there was a 
great announcement of accomplishment 
and now to continue to move on 
under that light of saying trust me, 
that everything is going to be okay, I 
think that those days are over. I am 
not saying they are over. The American 
people are saying they are over. 

One time here on the floor, Mr. RYAN 
went down a litany of things, and actually 
I was checking out some of your 
work on YouTube recently, and it had 
the one when you came and you said, 
forgive me for questioning what the 
President says or what the Republican 
majority at that time had to say about 
the fact of liberators and paying for 
the war and on and on and on. 

It continues, but the American people 
are now saying, Mr. Speaker, that 
we understand this Commander in 
Chief but we need the Congress to 
stand up and be the Congress, asking 
for accountability. 

So, with that, I know that we have a 
number of things to talk about here 
this evening, and we also have some 
fresh quotes from former brass because, 
of course, if you are enlisted or you are 
inside, you cannot speak truth to 
power or speak your mind. This information 
has just been released not only 
publicly but to those of us here in Congress. 
We want to share that with the 
Members. 

Also, I want to add that the death 
toll in Iraq is 3,351; wounded in action, 
returned to duty is up 13,875; and 
wounded in action and not returning to 
duty is 11,215. That is the latest at 10:00 

a.m. today. As you know, when we 
come to the floor, we give that report 
of that information because I think the 
Members need to understand that this 
is not a political issue. This is a serious 
issue that is facing the country and 
also facing the men and women in uniform 
and their families. 
So I do know that the American people 
are, and a super majority of them 
are, 100 percent behind accountability 
and also oversight. I think it is important 
that we have that, and the President 
is asking for a blank check. 

The thing that I am disappointed 
about is that the President had an opportunity 
to share something great 
with the country about a dialogue, but 
he decided to misrepresent what is in 
the legislation. I think that as we continue 
to talk about this tonight, that 
we continue to share with the Members, 
because every time we take a 
vote, the vote gets greater on behalf of 
accountability. I am hoping that we 
can meter up enough on both sides of 
the aisle to make sure that we hang in 
there with the men and women in 
harm’s way and those that may be 
placed in harm’s way and not wince to 
the President on some sort of floating 
politics that is going on right now. 

I hope they have a true dialogue. I 
am not about the political part of this. 
I am about the action part of this and 
making sure that our men and women 
have what they need. 

Mr. Speaker, we have done what we 
said we would do: make sure that they 
are funded; make sure that they have 
the equipment that they need; make 
sure that the men and women that 
went over into harm’s way, that the 
Department of Defense regulation as it 
relates to the downtime that they are 
supposed to have with their families, 


H4272 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

that they will have it and that if the 
Department of Defense was going to 
exit from that, then there has to be a 
reason why they were going to exit, for 
not holding their end of the deal when 
these men and women signed up as volunteers. 


So it is very, very important that 
those of us here in Congress make sure 
that within this democracy that many 
of these individuals are fighting for and 
making sure and those before them, 
the veterans, making sure we can salute 
one flag, that we honor them 
through our courage and integrity 
when it comes down to this very issue. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. RYAN. 

b 1945 
Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I appreciate that, 
and I think you are exactly right. 
There was a misrepresentation of the 
facts of the legislation that was put 
forth to the White House. I think it’s 
important for us, for us to go over in a 
snapshot of what the supplemental bill 
did that the President just vetoed. 
What this bill did was increase by 
$1.7 billion the amount of money that 
was going to defense health care for 
the troops. What it did was it increased 
veterans spending by $1.7 billion above 
what the President wanted. We tried to 
make law the benchmarks that the 
President set up for progress in Iraq on 
January 10, his benchmarks, and he vetoed 
that. 
Now, the President is vetoing his own 
statements, if that is not confusing 
enough. The key component of this 
piece of legislation is the piece that 
says that our troops can’t leave here 
and go to Iraq if they don’t have the 
proper body armor, if they don’t have 
the proper equipment, if they don’t 
have Humvees that are up armored, 
and if they don’t have the amount of 
rest that they need. That is what the 
President just vetoed. 
I think this is a pretty sad day in 
American history when you have the 
President of the United States trying 
to win a PR battle and using the troops 
as hostage. Those are not my words, 
those are the words of General Paul 
Eaton, who just said, after the statement, 
this is what he is saying on the 
President’s veto, ‘‘This administration 
and the previously Republican controlled 
legislature have been the most 
caustic agents against America’s 
Armed Forces in memory. Less than a 
year ago, the Republicans imposed 
great hardship on the Army and the 
Marine Corps by their failure to pass 
the necessary funding language. This 
time, the President of the United 
States is holding our Soldiers hostage 
to his ego. More than ever apparent, 
only the Army and the Marine Corps 
are at war—alone—without their President’s 
support.’’ 
Terrorism around the globe is up 25 
percent. Stop doing what you are doing 
to make terrorism increase by 25 percent. 
Enough of the scare tactics that 
if we don’t fight them there, they are 
going to come here and get us. The 

same scare tactics that they have been 
trying to employ for the past 5 years, 
this is the same group of people who 
told us, as was stated earlier, that the 
oil money would be used for reconstruction, 
it would only cost $50 billion, 
and now we are upwards of some 
$500 and some billion after the 2008 
budget, going to be greeted as liberators. 
All of the statements that 
have been made in the past 5 years 
have been wrong, colossal mistakes. 

The same people that said the mission 
was accomplished are the same 
people that are now telling us we don’t 
want any timetables, we don’t want 
any deadlines, we don’t want any goals 
for when we maybe should possibly, at 
some point, get out of Iraq and redeploy 
out. We don’t want any of that. 
They expect, after all these mistakes, 
all of these blunders, that somehow we 
are going to trust them. 

I am sorry, but you know what? Between 
now and when the President decides 
it’s time to get out, how many 
more soldiers are we going to lose? 
How many more kids are we going to 
go up and see at Walter Reed who have 
brain injuries and post-traumatic 
stress? 

That’s the difference between today 
and a year from now. That’s the difference 
between a deadline and an 
open-ended war, kids getting killed and 
innocent Iraqis getting killed. You 
know, I think that this is the height of 
arrogance that this veto showed by the 
President. 

Mr. MEEK of Florida. Let me just 
add to what you just said. Members 
may be in their office watching, or 
walk here on the floor and say, what’s 
Mr. RYAN and Mr. MEEK talking about, 
like we are independent individuals 
that just come to the floor just to say 
that we are upset. 

I must say that a number of Americans 
live through the people they respect 
in government, be it Republican 
or Democrat. Sometimes they lead into 
this political process. People they get 
involved in government for different 
reasons. Some folks say I am going to 
latch on to this individual, or I am 
going to latch on to that individual. It 
might have been John F. Kennedy for 
someone else. It might have been Ronald 
Reagan for another lady, or whatever 
the case may be. 

It may be Speaker of the House, who 
knows. But they get involved in government 
for whatever reason. We got 
involved in government because we are 
the same folks that went and signed up 
at the supervisor of elections to run for 
office, because we wanted to do something 
about what was happening here 
in Washington D.C. and represent the 
people, not just Democrats, not just 
Republicans, not just independents, but 
the people, and those that are yet unborn. 


I think it’s also important, when we 
start looking at these issues, we can 
just open today’s Washington Post, 
May 1. This is May 1, and this is Tuesday. 
Front page, April, toll, is the 

highest of 2007 for U.S. troops, 100 U.S. 
troops in a month. 

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Can I interrupt 
you and just make a highlight? In the 
President’s speech today he said that 
the incident levels are down. 

Mr. MEEK of Florida. I hear what 
you are saying. 

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I hear you too. 

Mr. MEEK of Florida. What is so very 
important for everyone to understand 
here, that this is above and beyond politics 
right now. For the President to 
say, the President is making a political 
statement, he is making a political 
statement because he once said, as long 
as I am President, we are not going to 
pull back any troops from Iraq. Just 
because he made that statement 
doesn’t necessarily mean that should 
be the case. 

We live in democracy, last I checked. 
No one stopped me walking down the 
street. No one kicked in my door, because 
I have rights. I think it’s important 
that the President understands 
that we live in a democracy. So, really, 
in my opinion, it’s hard to talk directly 
to the President about something 
when he has made a statement, 
and he has said, I am going to stick by 
it. 

This is not stick by your guns, you 
know, stick by whatever, however the 
song goes. It’s not appropriate to use 
when you talk about the man, but it’s 
stick by whatever statement you made. 
I think it’s important that people understand 
that we are going to the table 
of compromise, which the President 
said we were going to compromise, he 
didn’t sound like someone who really 
wanted to compromise in this statement 
at 6:10 today. 

He sounded like a person saying I am 
going to veto this, and they can come 
to the hill and the bottom line is the 
Congress is trying to do this, this and 
this. That is not looking at compromise, 
that is looking at keeping 
some sort of word that he has made. If 
you want to talk about word, I think 
it’s important. 

The good thing I like about the 30– 
Something working group members is 
the fact that the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD and past statements are so 
very, very important to today’s reality. 


The President said, in his comments, 
that he didn’t believe the time lines, 
and he spoke out very forcefully 
against them. Yet in 1990, on June 5, 
then Governor Bush said about President 
Clinton, I think it’s important for 
the President to lay out a timetable as 
to how long they will be involved and 
when they will be withdrawn, talking 
about another conflict. 

It’s good enough for President Clinton. 
It’s not good enough for him. It’s 
one thing for you, it’s an old saying, 
it’s one thing for you to ask somebody, 
you tell someone to do something when 
you are not willing to do it. I think it’s 
important, after all of this death, after 
all of the conflict that is going on in 
Iraq, in the middle of the winter, in the 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4273 

middle of the civil war, the American 
people are crying out. If it was political, 
and men and women weren’t losing 
their lives, and Walter Reed didn’t 
get a plane load of injured soldiers and 
Marines and airmen and the Coast 
Guard and sailors, then I would say, 
well, let’s play the political role. 

As far as I am concerned, when I 
talked to my friends on the Republican 
side of the aisle, I share with them, because 
I think there is some good Members 
that are there that want to speak 
their mind. When they see me in the 
hall or see in the cafeteria, they say, 
Kendrick, you know, you were on the 
floor the other day, you made a lot of 
sense. 

I say, why don’t you vote differently. 
Why don’t you vote in the emergency 
supplemental to send the troops the 
money? Because the more bipartisan 
votes we have, the harder it will be for 
the President to do what they are 
doing. 

Listen, to the Republican minority, 
you guys are on your way to a permanent 
minority in the U.S. House of 
Representatives and the Senate following 
the President on this issue of 
don’t ask any questions, just give me a 
blank check. The American people, 
unelected a number of Republican 
Members of the House and Senate last 
Congress. Why? Because they were rubber 
stamping everything that the 
President of the United States wanted. 

You have witnessed this. We have 
seen the difference. Now we have the 
opportunity to lead in a bipartisan 
way. We send a bill to the President, he 
says he is going to veto it because he 
doesn’t like it, and he misrepresents 
what the bill does. I think it’s important, 
as we go through this whole discourse 
of how we are going to carry out 
for the next, how we are going to carry 
out the mission in getting the men and 
women what they need, I think it’s important 
that we have a little truth that 
rises up out of all of this misinformation. 


Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I totally agree 
with you. I think the first step for 
most people who find themselves in a 
massive hole and going in the wrong direction, 
or following someone who continues 
to lead them down the wrong 
road, is to not follow that person any 
more. 

What the Democratic Congress has 
provided is what the American people 
sent the majority of the Democrats 
down here for in November, and that is 
to take this war in another direction, 
take our foreign policy in another direction. 
That is what this supplemental 
bill has done. The American 
people wanted us to take care of the 
veterans, and we increased $500 million 
for post-traumatic stress disorder, $500 
million additional for brain injuries, 
that is what the American people 
wanted, for us to fix the veterans’s 
problem. 

They wanted to make sure, they got 
tired of hearing about kids over there 
without body armor. So we made sure 

that no kid could go over there, or soldier 
or adult who is going to Iraq will 
not be over there without the proper 
equipment, body armor, up-armored 
Humvees, the proper rest when they 
get back, for over a year, let them rest. 
We gave the American people what 
they wanted, and what the troops deserved. 


To have that vetoed by a President 
who has been wrong on every single 
major foreign policy and domestic 
issue over the past 6 years doesn’t 
make any sense to the American people, 
and it certainly doesn’t make any 
sense to us. You look, and it’s getting 
better. You hear this all the time, it’s 
not getting better. 

It’s not. If it was getting better, do 
you think you would have this uproar 
from the American people? Do you 
think you would have all of these new 
Members of Congress if things were 
getting better? 

In a report that just came out, National 
Counterterrorism Center, terrorist 
incidents in Iraq rose by 91 percent 
from 3,468 in 2005 to 6,630 in 2006 
and getting worse. Innocent Iraqis are 
getting killed all the time, and they 
believe it’s because the American soldiers 
are there, because the American 
presence is there. That is what they believe, 
and we are saying we need to redeploy 
out of these major centers and 
stop policing a civil war. That is exactly 
what’s happening. 

One of the things we wanted to do in 
the supplemental that the President 
just vetoed is hold the Iraqi government 
accountable for training their 
own soldiers. You know, the President 
has always said, when they stand up, 
we stand down. Then they keep telling 
us that the Iraqi soldiers are standing 
up, but we are not standing down, 
which means they are not standing up. 

We wanted to put benchmarks in 
there so that the Iraqi soldiers would 
have to meet them or were leaving. 
Now, you can’t give people open-ended 
situations in which they can get out of. 
All we are trying to do is hold the Iraqi 
government responsible. 

I don’t like saying it, because I didn’t 
support this war from the beginning. 
To go in there and knock everything 
around and then say you are not doing 
what you are doing, but the bottom 
line is, if you do not get yourself 
trained, if you do not, as a country, get 
your police force ready, and your military 
ready, we can’t stay here forever. 

b 2000 
And, Mr. Speaker, I don’t think that 
is too much to ask. And the response 
from the President through his Secretary 
of State, Secretary Rice, signaled 
Bush’s opposition to, ‘‘Any war 
spending bill,’’ check this out, ‘‘that 
penalizes Iraqi’s government for failing 
to make progress.’’ We are not going to 
punish them for failing to make 
progress. Are we in a therapy session 
here? 
Mr. MEEK of Florida. Will the gentleman 
yield? 

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I will be happy to 
yield. 

Mr. MEEK of Florida. You know, a 
mayor of a U.S. city has to carry out 
accountability for Federal money; 
State governments have to account for 
the dollars and the progress of programs, 
block grant dollars, that we 
send to the States. Here on U.S. soil, 
they have to be accountable to the 
Federal Government. If they are not 
accountable, they may very well lose, 
what? Federal funding. 

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. That is right. 

Mr. MEEK of Florida. And what the 
President is saying, and this blank 
check; you know, Mr. RYAN, I really 
think that the President thinks that he 
has a rubber stamp Congress. I think 
that is what he is thinks, because that 
is what he is used to. 

It is almost like having a situation if 
you are a small business owner and you 
come in and you have a shop in one 
county and you spend most of your 
time over in the other county, you 
come over to your other shop and you 
notice the way they are doing business 
and there aren’t any accountability 
measures on productivity, there are no 
accountability measures on spending. 
And you are wondering why this shop, 
the shop in the opposite county that 
you are very seldom at is running on 
time or being cost effective, and then 
you come in and you say that there 
should be change; but then, better yet, 
the manager of that shop says, well, 
why should we change? I know we are 
not doing things the way you want us 
to do it and we know that we are 
spending a lot of money over here. Why 
should we change? Well, that is what 
we have right now. 

The President is saying that the 
Iraqi elected officials and the Iraqi 
government don’t have to be accountable 
and their feet should not be held 
to the fire. But, better yet, we have 
mayors, governors, State legislators, 
county commissioner, parish, what 
have you, they have to be accountable 
or they lose their funding or don’t get 
their funding when you are in a war 
that is costing $500 billion and counting. 


When you look at these issues, Members, 
you can’t help but say something 
is not right here. These are the people 
that are here in the United States of 
America, States, cities, counties that 
have to be accountable through Federal 
law and Federal appropriations. 
And over here, we have the Iraqi government. 
3,351 of our men and women 
that have died, over 26-plus thousand 
that have been injured. And wasted 
money. And 100 soldiers that died last 
month alone. And we don’t want accountable 
measures over here. We want 
to trust the administration on it, and 
we just want to say don’t put any 
benchmarks there, don’t even put any 
real goals there, don’t do anything, 
don’t ask any questions, just send us 
the money; you don’t know what you 
are doing. 

Well, I tell you this much. As long as 
this majority is here in this House of 


H4274 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

Representatives that passed a bipartisan 
bill, sent it to the White House, 
that had accountability measures in it, 
my prayer tonight is going to be for 
those that will be there at the negotiating 
table there in the White House 
come tomorrow morning that, on both 
sides, that they hold the interests of 
the American people before you hold 
the interests of someone that made a 
promise in Iraq, in a foreign land, to 
say that we are going to have as much 
flexibility that we are going to have, 
and accountability measures don’t 
need to be in place. 

It couldn’t come at a worse time, Mr. 
RYAN. The newspaper is full and the 
media is full of how the American people 
have not been told the truth. It is 
sickening. I feel that it is something 
that I didn’t do in the minority. Maybe 
I didn’t understand something in the 
last two Congresses that I was a part 
of, of watching all of this lack of information 
that has been given to Congress 
and how the administration has gotten 
away with this, and they have gotten 
away with saying, ‘‘I am sorry, that is 
all. What do you want from us?’’ We 
lost e-mails, CIA agents have been 
outed, clandestine operations abroad 
have been jeopardized. Men and women, 
there have been cover-ups. I am talking 
about testimony before Congress just 
weeks ago, things have been covered up 
with friendly fire of certain individuals 
that signed up to defend this country. 
Meanwhile, we are sitting here being 
nice guys and nice ladies and not 
standing and hold their feet to the fire. 

This is the reason why we have a U.S. 
House of Representatives, the reason 
we have a U.S. Senate, the reason why 
there are three branches of government, 
where we don’t have kingdom 
politics where one just says this is the 
way it is going to be, like it or not. 

Well, I have got a message for the 
White House and I have also got a message 
from the American people. The 
bottom line is we live in a democracy. 
We would love to sit down at the table 
of compromise so that we can come out 
with a work product. But don’t sit 
there saying what you are not going to 
do and what you are going to do before 
you sit down at the table. At least the 
leadership here is saying that we are 
going to make sure that there is accountability 
and that there are benchmarks 
there for progress, and make 
sure the U.S. taxpayer dollars are 
being sent, not just some sort of slogan 
of saying, well, you know, I am trying 
to command from over here. I mean, it 
didn’t make sense, Mr. RYAN. But the 
bottom line is, the thing that is good 
about this whole thing is that if this 
was a year ago, it wouldn’t even be a 
debate. It wouldn’t even be discussed. 
Accountability? Oh, no. The majority 
would say, we wouldn’t do that. And 
now we have the accountability, we 
have the strength of the majority in 
the Senate and the strength of the majority 
here in the House. 

But if there was a political question, 
like I said before, and one would sit 

back and just let it play out and say, 
well, one day we will get to that point. 
We cannot afford to get to that one 
day. We have to do this now. Not several 
months from now, now. The American 
people demand it, the U.S. troops 
deserve it, our veterans deserve it. 

There are dollars in this emergency 
supplemental that fix Walter Reed and 
start to fix the veterans services in 
this country. There are dollars in here 
that help make sure that the men and 
women have the proper training and 
the equipment before they get to the 
field. Wow, Mr. RYAN, there is a revelation 
there, that we will have equipment 
and that we would make sure 
that striker forces have what they need 
of making sure they have a commander 
and a gunner and a driver, the essentials, 
that are trained in those categories 
before that striker vehicle pulls 
out of Camp Victory. Wow, there is 
something, that we are actually going 
to do what we said we are going to do, 
and we are going to take the Department 
of Defense’s own regulations, Mr. 
RYAN, and put it into Federal law in 
this emergency supplemental; of saying 
that if you are going to spend these 
dollars, this $124-plus billion, that you 
are going to be accountable in these 
ways, Department of Defense. 

The reason why the President doesn’t 
like this, Mr. RYAN, is the fact that it 
is actually doing what it said that he 
would do, and he doesn’t want his 
words to actually come to fruition 
when it comes down to the way he described 
it. He came here at this podium, 
Mr. RYAN, we were sitting right 
out here. He came to that podium and 
said: We are going to hold the Iraqi 
government accountable. We are going 
to make sure that they train the 
troops. All of these things that he said, 
we took note as the Congress and put it 
into the emergency supplemental. And 
I think it is important that everyone 
understands what that is. 

One other thing, Mr. RYAN. The bill 
provides $21.1 billion for military 
health care, more than what the President 
requested; $900 million of that for 
posttraumatic stress disorder, $661 million 
to prevent health care fees increasing 
on our troops, $20 million to 
address the problem at Walter Reed. It 
provides $1.8 billion for more veterans 
health care, more than what the President 
has called for. I want to add 
again, $595 million to address the backlog 
maintaining the VA health care facilities, 
$250 million to hire additional 
personnel for the administration for 
VA health care, for the health care system, 
$229 million for treatment for the 
growing number of Iraqi and Afghanistan 
veterans, $100 million for mental 
health care in veterans assistance, $83 
million to speed up the processing of 
claims for veterans returning back 
from Iraq and Afghanistan. It also provides 
other additional above what the 
President calls for as it relates to supporting 
of the troops. 

And I think it is important that people 
understand, $2 billion for more stra


tegic reserve readiness funds, which $1 
billion is for Army National Guard 
equipment shortfalls. This is very, very 
important. $1.1 billion for more military 
housing and $3 billion more for 
making sure that there is mine resistant 
ambush protection, what we call 
MRAPs, for troops in Iraq. 

Mr. RYAN, the reason why the President 
is talking about additional spending, 
I want to make sure that every 
veteran in the United States of America 
understands that he is talking 
about the money that I just described 
and then some. 

So, Mr. Speaker, I know that the 
President is used to having bills come 
to his desk that he can’t even wait for 
it to get through the door before he 
signs it in tax cuts for the billionaires 
and those super wealthy. But this time 
he had legislation that’s before him or 
he had legislation before him that he 
vetoed it that would have helped everyday 
Joe and Sue that signed up to 
serve this country in the way that this 
country asked them to serve. And, doggone 
it, if we can’t stand behind them, 
then something is really wrong. 

And I am really glad, Mr. RYAN, that 
I am not just speaking on the behalf of 
the ‘‘if we could, we would.’’ But I can 
tell you this. What the majority leader 
is doing when he sits down in the Senate 
with the President tomorrow and 
the Speaker of this House what she is 
doing when she sits down with the 
President of the United States tomorrow, 
I want them to feel that they are 
wearing the breastplate of righteousness 
to be able to go to the President 
and say, these are average people, they 
are not sons and daughters of millionaires 
and billionaires. And, you know 
something? They are going to have 
rights, too. They have rights. And they 
have the right to be represented, and 
they will be represented. And I am so 
happy that we are going toe to toe with 
the President of the United States, not 
for politics, but for the country and for 
the folks that their mom and dad, they 
may only own one pickup truck, some 
of them wanted to go to college but 
couldn’t afford to go to college, some 
might have gone to college and went 
into the Marines or to the Army or to 
the Navy or to the Air Force or into 
the Coast Guard. Those that are serving 
in theater as officers, we owe it to 
them. That is the bottom line. They 
deserve the representation. 

I know that the President is used to 
getting a blank check so Halliburton 
can spend all the money they want to 
spend and burn trucks and then get 
paid by the Federal Government. That 
will no longer happen, not under this 
watch, not as long as we have a Democratic 
majority in this House and a bipartisan 
spirit that is willing to send 
him the bill. 

I don’t want to challenge the President 
to veto another bill. I want to 
challenge the President to come to the 
table and sit down, and let’s have a 
sensible conversation and let’s come up 
with a work product that we can all 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4275 

live with. It is not going to all be that 
he wants, it is not going to be all that 
we want. But doggone it, Mr. Speaker, 
when they rise from that table and we 
get the report, the rest of us, Members 
of Congress, the integrity of what we 
have sent to the White House when it 
comes down to accountability, when it 
comes down to performance, and when 
it comes down to holding the Iraqi government 
accountable and assisting our 
men and women that have served and 
those that are coming back from theater 
when they need veteran services, 
that must be there. That has to be 
there. And if the President doesn’t 
allow it, then I would say our leadership 
should not allow him to have his 
way. 

As far as I am concerned, it is a no-
brainer; and that is the reason why the 
American people overwhelmingly support 
our position, Mr. RYAN. When I 
say our position, I am not saying the 
Democratic majority’s position, I am 
saying the position of the bipartisan 
legislation that we passed through 
House and Senate. 

I want to thank you for your patience, 
sir, because I thought it was 
very, very important that we talk a little 
bit about what the President did 
veto and what’s in the legislation so 
that folks don’t get the misrepresentation 
that has been given to them over 
the last hour or so from the White 
House. 

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. And let’s be clear 
about this whole issue of deadlines. 
There was a deadline that came out of 
the House version, for the political 
junkies that are paying attention, Mr. 
Speaker. There was a hard deadline 
that came out of the House version, 
not in the Senate version. And the 
compromise that just went to the 
President had the goal, just the goal of 
maybe getting out of Iraq. No hard 
deadline, just the goal, because we 
knew that he would veto a hard deadline. 
And as much as we don’t like it, 
he is the President of the United 
States. But there is the goal of leaving. 
This President, Mr. Speaker, can’t even 
think about the goal of getting out of 
Iraq. He doesn’t even want to talk 
about it. 

There is no deadline in this supplemental 
that he just vetoed, no hard 
deadline at all. The language said, the 
goal of getting out. So let’s be very, 
very clear. 

Now, when people ask, well, why do 
we need to get out. People I think feel 
why. There’s a lot of really good examples, 
not just from Democrats as some 
of our friends may like to think, but 
from a variety of others. 

b 2015 
Here’s what is happening in Iraq, as 
the Washington Post reported, ‘‘A department 
of the Iraqi Prime Minister’s 
Office is playing a leading role,’’ this is 
the Iraqi Prime Minister’s Office, playing 
a leading role ‘‘in the arrest and removal 
of senior Iraqi Army and National 
Police Officers, some of whom 

had apparently worked too aggressively 
to combat violent Shiite militias, 
according to U.S. military officials 
in Baghdad. Since March 1, at 
least 16 Army and National Police 
Commanders have been fired, detained 
or pressured to resign. At least 9 of 
them are Sunnis.’’ 

So now they are removing police and 
military people that are cracking down 
on the wrong, somehow the wrong 
group of terrorists. And some folks say 
this is not like Vietnam. 

How about Senator HAGEL, leading 
Republican, conservative. I read today 
he had an 85 percent rating from a conservative 
think tank. So he is clearly a 
conservative Republican. He just got 
back from Iraq. Here’s what he says in 
Mr. Novak’s column of yesterday, or 2 
days ago. ‘‘This thing is coming undone 
quickly, and Maliki’s government is 
weaker by the day. The police are corrupt, 
top to bottom. The oil problem is 
a huge problem. They still can’t get 
anything through the parliament. No 
hydrocarbon law, no deBaathification 
law, no provincial elections.’’ 

That’s CHUCK HAGEL, our friend in 
the Senate, our colleague in the United 
States Senate. Republican from Nebraska; 
85 percent conservative rating 
from a conservative group here in 
Washington. 

We’re saying that we need to change 
direction, Mr. Speaker. We’re saying 
that the Iraqi government has had over 
4 years to try to piece this thing together, 
and that we’ve done all that we 
can do. And the American people do 
not want to lose any more soldiers to 
this war. And we want a deadline. We 
want to get out. We want to get out 
with respect. We want to get out with 
dignity, we want to get out and protect 
our troops. 

But it turns out that the presence of 
the United States in Iraq is inciting violence. 
We’re inciting the civil war. 
We’re the ones being attacked, as well 
as others around. And in April, it’s 
been the sixth highest month of American 
soldiers getting killed in the entirety 
of the war. 

Let’s fix this. Let’s go in a new direction. 
This is not time for bravado. This 
it not time for ego. This is time for the 
American people to come together and 
the Congress to come together, the 
President to recognize that this has 
not worked, and for us to try to re-establish 
some level of credibility in the 
world. And this President needs to listen 
to the will of the American people. 

And I want to make one final point, 
because we have this tremendous debate 
in the country that is not always 
framed the right way. But I want 
friends who we run into in the street, 
and someone says I’m pro-choice and 
I’m pro-life, and I think we’re all pro-
life. But the debate has been framed as 
such that pro-life Americans take their 
role and their issues very seriously. 

And I find it extremely ironic, as a 
pro-life Democrat who voted for the 
partial birth abortion bill, that this 
President has two vetos. His one veto 

is on stem cell research, because that’s 
a pro-life issue. And his second veto is 
to continue a war in which thousands 
of American soldiers have been killed 
and injured, and in which tens of thousands, 
if not hundreds of thousands of 
Iraqi citizens, innocent, many of them, 
have been killed. And by keeping this 
open-ended, by keeping this open-
ended, we know that there will be more 
death and destruction. 

So I find it ironic that this President 
has two vetos; one pro-life, supposedly, 
and the other pro-war. And how they 
reconcile that on the other end of 
Pennsylvania Avenue, I’ll have no idea. 
But I think it is important for us to 
recognize how sometimes dysfunctional 
the philosophy, Mr. MEEK, of 
this President and this administration 
has been. 

And so, let’s, on the anniversary of 
‘‘Mission Accomplished,’’ and recognizing 
the failures of the past, let’s do 
what Americans do, and that’s fix the 
problem. Americans are full of problem 
solvers, and that’s what we do in this 
country. We fix things, whether it’s the 
car or the computer, or the truck, we 
fix things. 

And I hope that the President will 
find it in his heart to sit down with 
Speaker PELOSI, to sit down with Leader 
REID and the leadership from this 
Congress, and draw on the knowledge 
of IKE SKELTON, the Chair of our Armed 
Services Committee, who’s been in this 
institution, I think, over 30 years. 
Draw on the knowledge of JACK MURTHA, 
who’s been in this Congress almost 
40 years on the Defense Appropriations 
Committee. And stop listening 
to those people who got us in this 
situation. 

I yield to my friend. 

Mr. MEEK of Florida. You know, Mr. 
RYAN, it’s interesting. You mentioned 
Chairman MURTHA. Chairman MURTHA 
was fine with the administration as 
long as he was voting with the administration 
in the minority, being the 
ranking member on Defense Appropriations. 
They didn’t have a problem with 
him. As a matter of fact, he was held 
up as a hero, decorated veteran, longstanding 
member of the Defense Appropriations 
Committee in the House, 
ally, called to the White House for his 
advice. 

As soon as Mr. MURTHA figured out 
that, not only was the intelligence that 
the Congress was given was inaccurate, 
and as soon as he figured out that we 
could not win ‘‘war militarily,’’ and he 
went through a long assessment in figuring 
this out, and talking with professionals 
and talking with generals, talking 
with those that are still enlisted, 
going into theater, that’s what you’re 
supposed to do as an appropriator, 
making sure the American taxpayer 
dollars are being spent appropriately; 
making sure that what they’re telling 
you here on Capitol Hill is actually reality, 
is the actual reality out in the 
field. 

A lot of folks look to the Middle East 
when they think of the war. Well, the 


H4276 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

effects of the war are felt right here in 
this country. You go to the military 
bases and you talk to these families. 
It’s hard to go to many of these military 
bases because you see the children, 
you see the husband or the wife 
that’s left behind. You see those that 
have lost their loved one, or those that 
are now, have their loved one coming 
back without an arm or a leg, or mentally 
affected by going into theater 
without the necessary time back home 
to recover mentally and physically 
from being in the middle of a civil war. 
I think it’s important for us to realize 
that and understand that there’s great 
gravity on this issue. 

And the President may believe, in his 
own mind and also within his advisors 
that are standing around him, that he 
has to stick to his guns, he has to, you 
know, it’s a fight at the OK Corral or 
here in the Capitol city. It’s not a 
fight. We’re all Americans. We’re all on 
the same side. We salute one flag. 

I think it’s important for us to understand 
that there are some folks 
here, some of them wear blue jeans, 
some of them wear, you know, shop at 
big box stores and small stores in the 
small town, some folk never walked in 
a mall before, and if they walked in a 
mall they couldn’t afford many of the 
things that are in the mall. These are 
a number of our, a super majority of 
the folks that are represented within 
the Armed Services. They aren’t the 
only ones that serve their country, but 
many of them are financial challenged. 
And their voice is just as strong as the 
next person, or should be. 

And so when we talk about just the 
simple things on behalf of the men and 
women in uniform and making sure 
that we bring some sense to this, because 
if the President had his way, we 
would be there, my children’s children 
will have an opportunity to see this 
war continue. 

And I think it’s very, very important 
that we talk about accountability; not 
talk about it, act on it. And that’s 
what we’re doing. We’re acting on it. 

Let’s look at what the President is 
all concerned about. The President 
must determine that substantial 
progress, I must add, is made on security, 
political and reconstruction 
benchmarks by July, 2007. Well, the 
President can just say, well, you know, 
I think that’s fine. I think we’re making 
progress. 

If the President cannot certify 
progress, redeployment must start by 
July with a goal of being completed, 
and it has to be certified, that if in 
July, certification is made, redeployment 
of U.S. troops may begin by August 
1 of 2007, with a goal to be complete 
within 180 days, by March 31, 2008. 

This is sending a message to the Iraqi 
government that they have to whip 
themselves in shape; they have to 
make sure that we train the troops. 
Now, this is combat, this is not cutting 
off training. Training will continue. 
The things that will take U.S. troops 
out of harm’s way will continue. 

We’re patrolling the streets of Baghdad. 
We’re patrolling the streets of 
Tikrit and other places. You hear reports 
of security forces, Iraqi security 
forces, it’s very slim. But you hear an 
uptick in U.S. troops that are taking 
place, I mean, that are taking place 
right now. And so I think it’s all important 
that we understand that accountability 
measures are in place. 

Now, Mr. RYAN, when we talk about 
accountable. It’s interesting. On the 
prescription drug plan there were 
benchmarks. You had to be enrolled by 
a certain date. And if you weren’t enrolled 
by a certain date then there 
would be penalties for not enrolling by 
a certain date. 

It’s very, very important that Americans 
and the Members of this Congress 
understand that anything, to bring 
about progress, has to have benchmarks 
and goals. 

To kind of just say, well, hey, here’s 
$1 million. Don’t worry about it. We 
don’t care if you provide what you say 
that you’re going to provide. We don’t 
care how you spend it. You use your 
own discretion. You spend it. We’re not 
going to say anything. 

Well, that’s been the case for about 4 
years in this Iraq war. And now we’re 
saying that we want to march by a different 
drummer’s beat, one of accountability, 
one of making sure the integrity 
of what we tell the American people 
is actually, you actually see it, you 
actually are able to follow through 
with that, what you said that you were 
going to do, that you actually do it, 
Mr. RYAN. 

And the problem is that the President 
is finding himself having to be accountable. 
And I can tell you right now 
that the political question, it’s not an 
issue here, because the election took 
place last November. The people have 
spoken, so we don’t even need to get on 
that issue. 

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Can I share with 
the American people and our colleagues 
one more? First, I thought it 
was interesting, and our crack staff 
here, the President gave his speech in 
front of the Jefferson Memorial. We’ve 
got a great quote, 1789, when Jefferson 
wrote a letter to Madison talking 
about war. ‘‘We have already given one 
effectual check to the dog of war, by 
transferring the power of letting him 
loose from the Executive to the Legislative 
body, from those who are to 
spend to those who are to pay.’’ 

And I think it would be appropriate, 
if Mr. Bush is going to use President 
Jefferson as a backdrop, that he should 
recognize at least his philosophy on 
some of these issues. 

But a quote from General John Batiste, 
retired general. Today, and this 
is on his response to the President’s 
veto. ‘‘The President vetoed our troops 
and the American people. His stubborn 
commitment to a failed strategy in 
Iraq is incomprehensible. He committed 
our great military to a failed 
strategy in violation of basic principles 
of war. His failure to mobilize the Na


tion to defeat worldwide Islamic extremism 
is tragic.’’ 

b 2030 
‘‘We deserve more from our Commander 
in Chief and his administration.’’ 
That is Major General John Batiste, 
retired general. 
It has been a pleasure being here 
with you today. I hope this week, with 
the leadership of Leader PELOSI, that 
we continue to stand strong behind the 
American people. And you can be assured, 
Mr. Speaker, that when Ms. 
PELOSI and Mr. REID are there tomorrow 
negotiating that they will be representing 
the will of the American people, 
the 65 percent of the American people 
that want a deadline to get us out. 
30somethingdems@mail.house.gov for 
any e-mails that the Members may 
want to send us. The charts that we 
have here, some we showed tonight and 
some we didn’t, are all on our Web site 
www.speaker.gov/30something. And, 
again, the e-mail address is 
30somethingdems@mail.house.gov. 
Mr. MEEK of Florida. Reclaiming my 
time, Mr. RYAN, I thought you made 
some very good points when you read 
the comments from the general, when 
you talked about the Jefferson backdrop 
and all today. 
General Petraeus, whom I know and I 
have seen in theater, which I have been 
to Iraq twice, yes, he is a man that we 
all feel very good about. We know that 
he is carrying out a mission on behalf 
of his country. But we should not ride 
on the back of his accomplishments as 
a general and a commander in the field 
to justify the policy that is being carried 
out by this administration. 
I tell you this, Mr. RYAN, that historians, 
in the very near future, are 
going to look back at this time and are 
going to wonder where the leaders were 
when this war and this moment right 
now that we are speaking in was taking 
place. When I used to play football, 
we used to have a saying, ‘‘The blind 
leading the blind and the two shall fall 
in the ditch.’’ The bottom line is if you 
know that the policy has been wrong, 
the intelligence has been inaccurate, 
and that everyone that has left the administration 
has just about written a 
book about when the lie was told and 
how they heard it first and when it was 
said, I think it is important that people 
understand and that the Members 
of this House understand how history 
will reflect on your vote and your lack 
of leadership or your leadership. One of 
the two. If you want to listen to someone 
else, and I talked to my friends on 
the minority side, the Republican side. 
There are some of their former colleagues 
right now watching us in this 
debate here on the floor and wishing 
that they could take their vote back 
and stand up to the administration. 
Maybe, just maybe, they would still be 
in Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I will close on this 
point: The bottom line is that it is 
time for leadership. It is time for Members 
on both sides of the aisle and especially 
on the minority side of the aisle, 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4277 

the Republican side of the aisle, to go 
see the wizard, get some courage, and 
come back to this floor and back the 
will of the American people for accountability 
for our men and women in 
harm’s way and making sure that we 
hold to the integrity of what the President 
said he would do and making sure 
that we hold the Iraqi government’s 
feet to the fire as though we would 
hold the mayor of Youngstown, Ohio’s, 
feet to the fire or Sioux City, Iowa. We 
are going to hold their feet to the fire 
for Federal dollars. Why can’t we hold 
Iraqi government’s feet for Federal dollars? 
And the President is saying don’t 
hold their feet to the fire and don’t 
hold my words, whatever I have said in 
the past, as though I meant what I 
said. And the bottom line is that we 
have a responsibility. 

So as we carry out that responsibility 
tomorrow morning at the White 
House, I hope that we are at the table 
of compromise but also holding to the 
integrity of what we originally sent to 
the President. 

There has already been compromise. 
The language changed from when we 
passed it here on the floor and it went 
to the conference committee. Some 
language was changed then because the 
President didn’t like it, and then it 
came to the floor and we voted for 
that. And now it is to the White House, 
and the President says he still doesn’t 
like it. Now we are about to sit down 
again with the President to talk about 
these issues. And then maybe, just 
maybe, there may be another vote here 
on the floor and the President may say 
he still doesn’t like it. 

So when it comes down to the speech 
of who is letting the troops down, I 
think it is going to become more and 
more evident to the American people 
and to the Congress that we have a 
problem on the executive branch end of 
not being at the table of compromise 
for real on behalf of our men and 
women in uniform. We are doing our 
job. Let’s continue to do it. 

With that, Mr. RYAN, Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the leadership for allowing 
us to come here to address the 
American people in the U.S. House 
once again. It was a great honor. 

f 

THE BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN 

REFORM ACT AND PEAK OIL 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
COHEN). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 18, 2007, the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. BARTLETT) 
is recognized for 60 minutes. 

Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland. Mr. 
Speaker, I want to spend the first few 
minutes this evening talking about 
oral arguments that were recently 
made before the Supreme Court. It was 
on the Wisconsin Right to Life, Incorporated, 
versus the Federal Election 
Commission. 

Now, it is not clear from that title 
what we are talking about. What we 
are really talking about is a test of the 
constitutionality of a clause in the Bi


partisan Campaign Reform Act that 
prohibits any issue advocacy advertising, 
electioneering they call it, 30 
days before a primary and 60 days before 
a general election. 

Now, in the State of Maryland in a 
nonpresidential year, our primary is in 
September, and it is, as a matter of 
fact, less than 60 days before the general 
in November. So we are prohibited 
from issue advocacy ads 30 days before 
the primary, which are added immediately 
to the 60 days before the general. 
So for 90 days, 3 months, before 
the election, we cannot communicate 
with our constituents. 

I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that 
few people are seriously considering 
the next election 90 days before it occurs. 
So for all practical purposes, we 
in Maryland, and many other States 
like us that have primaries close to the 
general election, are almost completely 
prohibited from communicating 
with our constituents through issue advocacy 
ads. 

This is political speech, and what 
this Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act 
does is to deny political speech 30 days 
before a primary and 60 days before a 
general election. 

I think to put this in context to see 
how really important this is, we need 
to go back to the founding of our country 
and to understand why our Founding 
Fathers came here. 

Most of them came for one or both of 
two reasons to escape tyrannies in the 
country that they lived in. One of these 
was the tyranny of the church. In the 
British Isles it was the Anglican 
Church, and on the continent it was 
the Roman Church. And in most of the 
country there was a state church. And 
these state churches, the Anglican 
Church in England and the Roman 
Church on the continent, could and did 
oppress other religions. So our Founding 
Fathers came here to escape that 
tyranny. 

They also came here to escape the 
tyranny of the crown. And it is incredible 
to us. We can’t understand it because 
we live in a whole different culture. 
But almost every country from 
which our Founding Fathers came had 
a king or an emperor which claimed 
and was granted divine rights. What 
that said was that the rights came 
from God to the king and the king 
would give what rights he wished to his 
people. Some magnanimous rulers gave 
considerable rights to their people; 
others gave very few. So our Founding 
Fathers came here intent on escaping 
those two tyrannies. 

So it is no accident that after writing 
the Constitution in which it was very 
clear that this was to be a government 
of the people, by the people, and for the 
people, as Abraham Lincoln said four 
score and seven years later, and that 
the government was to reflect the 
wishes of the people, that the people 
through collective government would 
govern themselves. That was really 
quite implicit in the Constitution because 
article I, section 8 of the Con


stitution gave very few rights to the 
Federal Government. 

But the ink was hardly dry on the 
Constitution before they wondered if 
people would really understand that 
what they wanted was a very limited 
Federal Government and that they 
wanted most of the rights to belong to 
the people. So it is no accident, I 
think, that in that first amendment, 
which they wrote, that they addressed 
both of these tyrannies. From the very 
beginning, they wanted to make it 
crystal clear that we were to have freedom 
of religion, and they say it very 
simply, that they wanted to avoid what 
they came from, what they came here 
to escape, and that was an established 
religion, a religion established by the 
government. So they said very simply 
‘‘Congress shall make no law respecting 
an establishment of religion.’’ 

I don’t know why we have trouble understanding 
that, Mr. Speaker. It is 
just plain English. It has nothing to do 
with a wall of separation between 
Church and State. Indeed, our Founding 
Fathers were deeply religious people, 
and they believed that we should 
have religious people running our government. 
President Adams said that 
our Constitution was written for a religious 
people which serves the purposes 
of no other. So it is no surprise that in 
the first amendment they addressed 
both tyrannies actually. ‘‘Congress 
shall make no law respecting an establishment 
of religion.’’ Don’t establish 
any State religion. And, furthermore, 
let everybody worship freely. They said 
‘‘or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.’’ 


And then they addressed the tyranny 
of the crown. And I have here an article 
that was written by James Bopp, 
who was the primary person to argue 
this case before the Supreme Court. He 
said that the American government 
was to be an act of self government by 
the people and the first amendment 
was to ensure the people’s participation 
in their own government by protecting 
the four indispensable democratic 
freedoms of speech, press, assembly, 
and petitioning the government. 
Thus the first amendment was intended 
to deprive the government of 
the power to silence criticism of official 
actions, which is precisely what 
this well-intentioned but, unfortunately, 
otherwise directed Bipartisan 
Campaign Reform Act does. It limits 
the criticism of the people who are 
making our laws, of anybody in the 
government or anybody running for 
government. 

The first amendment says it this 
way: ‘‘or abridging the freedom of 
speech, or of the press, or the right of 
the people peaceably to assemble, and 
to petition the Government for a redress 
of grievances.’’ 

Mr. Speaker, this is a very important 
case before the Supreme Court. It is 
just not an issue of political speech, 
which, by the way, was the speech that 
our Founding Fathers most wanted to 
protect. And how ironic that a law that 


H4278 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

concerns elections is a law which 
strikes down the very speech freedom 
that our Founding Fathers most wanted 
to protect. 

But this is significant beyond that, 
Mr. Speaker, because if our Congress 
can deny this right to the American 
people, what else can it deny? We are a 
great, free country, 1 person out of 22 
in the world and we have a fourth of all 
the good things in the world. How did 
we get here? I think it is very instructive 
to ask that question and to have it 
answered for my satisfaction. You may 
come to different conclusions. But I 
think there are two major reasons that 
we are this very unique country, this 1 
person out of 22 in the world, less than 
5 percent of the world’s population that 
has a fourth of all the good things in 
the world. And I think that both of the 
reasons that we are this great, free 
country are addressed in this first 
amendment. Our Founding Fathers believed 
that God sat with them at the 
table when they wrote the Declaration 
of Independence and the Constitution 
and the amendments, and I think they 
were right. And I think we put at risk 
who we are when we deny the religious 
role in the establishment of our country. 


b 2045 
And the 10 commandments are coming 
down from the court house walls. 
Nativity scenes appear less and less 
frequently in public places. And we are 
now, of all things, going to debate 
whether it’s okay to say ‘‘under God’’ 
in the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag. 
Mr. Speaker, I reread the Declaration 
of Independence recently, I think it is 
well to read that every so often, and I 
noted that God is mentioned four or 
five times there. I wonder if our courts 
might declare the Declaration of Independence 
unconstitutional. 
There is, on a lighter side, a really 
great clause here. I have no idea what 
the king had done, but I think that 
there could be no better description of 
our regulatory agencies, and I don’t 
know how our Founding Fathers could 
have been so prophetic in describing 
our regulatory agencies; this is what 
they said, Mr. Speaker. ‘‘He has erected 
a multitude of new offices and sent 
hither swarms of officers to harass our 
people and eat out their substance.’’ 
They had a way with words, didn’t 
they? And I think that there could be 
no more concise definition of the unfortunate 
frequent application of our 
regulatory agencies and their limitation 
of the rights of the American people. 
Well, I would encourage Americans 
everywhere to listen, to watch for the 
report of the Supreme Court. They 
promise to hand down their decision 
sometime before the end of the court’s 
term in June. This is a very important 
decision, it goes beyond just this case 
of ‘‘Washington right to life.’’ Just 
what was that case? The right to life 
people were sending out educational information. 
And unfortunately, one of 

the Senators was running, and since always 
right to life, abortion and so 
forth are issues in political campaigns, 
the FEC decided that this was prohibited 
advertising, although I don’t think 
that either Senator was even mentioned 
in the advertising. And so the 
right to life committee there, I think 
very appropriately, has decided to 
make this a Supreme Court test. 

Indeed, when this law was passed 
many people thought that it was unconstitutional. 
The President thought 
that it was unconstitutional and said 
so, that the court would strike down 
this provision. Indeed, I think those 
who wrote the law thought that this 
provision was probably unconstitutional 
because they put into the law 
language that said that if any one part 
of the law was struck down, that the 
rest of the law was still applicable. 
That appears in very little of our legislation. 
It’s an indication, I think, that 
they felt that this part of their legislation 
was on pretty shaky constitutional 
ground. 

So I would encourage you to watch 
this. This is a very important decision, 
not just for this case, but I think that 
that will be read very broadly as an indication 
of how much power does the 
Congress have to infringe on our constitutionally—
our God-given liberties, 
by the way. These came from God, they 
didn’t come from our Constitution. All 
the Constitution seeks to do is to make 
sure that the government can’t take 
them away from us. 

I want to spend our remaining time, 
Mr. Speaker, talking about a subject 
that was highlighted today in the 
ACORE, the American Council on Renewable 
Energy, ‘‘The Outlook on Renewable 
Energy in America.’’ And 
there are several recent articles that 
deal with this. There was a very interesting 
exchange between T. Boone 
Pickens and Steve Forbes. T. Boone 
Pickens believes that the world has 
reached its maximum capacity for producing 
oil; that try as hard as we wish, 
the oil-producing countries will not be 
able to increase their production of oil, 
and this phenomenon is called peak oil. 
And T. Boone Pickens said several 
weeks ago that he believes the world 
has reached peak oil. Steve Forbes 
took exception with that and indicated 
that he believed that the marketplace 
could take care of this. And if it didn’t 
find more oil, it would find alternatives 
to oil so there would be no decrement 
in our growth when we’re growing 
at roughly 2 percent a year in energy 
use. By the way, that 2 percent a 
year may not sound like much, but 
that doubles in 35 years, it’s 4 times 
bigger in 70 years and it’s 8 times bigger 
in 105 years. Now the world will 
still be here in 105 years, and my great, 
great grandchildren will still be alive 
in 105 years. I don’t have the foggiest 
notion where we would get 8 times the 
energy compared to the energy that we 
are using now. So clearly that is not a 
world we should look forward to. T. 
Boone Pickens had an interesting dis


cussion with Steve Forbes; and if you 
use those two names on a Google 
search, you will pull up their conversation. 


There are many people who seem to 
worship the marketplace, they believe 
that it is both omniscient and omnipotent, 
it is all wise and all powerful. I 
point out to them that there are some 
things that even God can’t do; God 
can’t make a square circle, and the 
marketplace can’t make oil where 
there is not oil. And the marketplace 
cannot provide alternatives to oil faster 
than technology will permit us to do 
that. 

There is an interesting article, and 
this one appeared on March 25 in the 
Washington Post. This was really an 
interesting article. It says, ‘‘Corn Can’t 
Solve Our Problem.’’ Corn, of course, is 
the source of ethanol, which is an alternative 
renewable energy. And the 
article pointed out that if we took all 
of our corn ground, every bit of it, no 
tortillas for Mexicans and no food for 
pigs and cows and chickens and no 
cornbread for us, all of our corn is 
made into ethanol, that if you discounted 
that for the fossil fuel input, 
which they said was 80 percent. By the 
way, there are some scientists who believe 
that we use more energy in producing 
ethanol from corn than we get 
out of the ethanol. I generally use 75 
percent in my discussions, this article 
said 80 percent. But if you discount the 
ethanol you produce by 80 percent, it 
would displace 2.4 percent of our gasoline. 
Now, that’s making all of our corn 
into ethanol. It would displace, after 
you discounted it for the fossil fuel 
input, because you are just burning fossil 
fuel in another form if you don’t do 
that, if you discounted for fossil fuel 
input, it would displace 2.4 percent of 
our gasoline. 

The authors of the article pointed 
out something very interesting. They 
said if you are really interested in saving 
gasoline, you could save that much 
gasoline by tuning up your car and putting 
enough air in your tires. And I 
heard nobody who disputed that. So if 
we use all of our corn for ethanol, you 
could save as much gasoline by simply 
tuning up your car and putting air in 
the tires. 

Then on April 5 there was another 
very interesting article that related to 
these renewables, and this was an article 
in the Wall Street Journal, upper 
right, very important, above the fold. 
It says, ‘‘A Dying Giant: Mexico Tries 
to Save a Big Fading Oil Field.’’ 
‘‘Canterell’s Drop Off Faster Than Expected, 
Turning to Technology’’ is the 
title of the article. Canterell was the 
name of a Mexican fisherman who kept 
getting his nets fouled in crude oil, and 
he would take these nets to Pemex, and 
he knew who was at fault because there 
was only one oil company in Mexico, 
and said look what you did to my net, 
and they would give him a new net. 
And he came in so frequently they finally 
said, gee, we didn’t think we were 
spilling that much oil. And they asked 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4279 

him, where is this oil coming from? 
And he says, come and I will show you. 
And so he took them and showed them 
oil kind of bubbling up out of the ocean 
and they drilled there. This was named 
after him, the Canterell oil field. It was 
the second largest one in the world. 
The largest one in the world is the 
Ghawar oil field, the granddaddy of all 
oil fields, producing still, down from 
what it was at its peak, still producing 
5 million barrels of oil a day. Canterell, 
until 2 years ago, produced 2 million 
barrels a day. In the last 2 years, it has 
dropped off 20 percent in production. 
Thus, the article, upper right in the 
Wall Street Journal on April 5. 

Obviously, if we don’t have oil, we’re 
going to have to find alternatives, so 
this relates to the subject of this conference 
today on alternative renewable 
energy. 

And then May 1, there is an article 
about Hugo Cha´vez ‘‘aims to weaken 
the U.S.,’’ it says, ‘‘China to get preference 
with oil from projects now 
under state control.’’ And he was celebrating 
his nationalization of the fields 
of four companies. I think that maybe 
all the oil now in Venezuela has been 
nationalized. 

In addition to nationalized oil, he 
made the point that he was going to 
make China, with whom he is 
partnering, a preferred customer for 
his oil, and it would be shipped there 
rather than the United States. And his 
aim is to hurt the United States. 

This pending critical shortage of oil 
has resulted in a common cause by five 
groups in this country. The ‘‘peak oil’’ 
group is just one of the groups that 
have common cause. And I wanted to 
spend just a moment talking about 
these people of common cause, all of 
whom want to move from fossil fuels to 
renewables, for different reasons. 

The first group are those who are 
concerned about national security. A 
letter was sent by Boyden Gray and 29 
others, Jim Woolsey, a number of retired 
four star admirals and generals to 
the President, this was a couple of 
years ago, saying, ‘‘Mr. President, the 
fact that we have less than 2 percent of 
oil in the world and we use 25 percent 
of the world’s oil and we import about 
two-thirds of what we use is a totally 
unacceptable national security risk. 
We really have to do something about 
that.’’ 

The next slide is on this same subject, 
and this is a statement by 
Condoleezza Rice, a very interesting 
statement. ‘‘We do have to do something 
about the energy problem. I can 
tell you that nothing has really taken 
me aback more as Secretary of State 
than the way that the politics of energy 
is—I will use the word ‘warping’ 
diplomacy around the world.’’ Concerned 
About National Security. So 
this is one of the groups that has common 
cause, Concerned About National 
Security. 

The next chart shows a second group. 
This group has a lot of visibility now. 
Al Gore came here to the House 2 or 3 

weeks ago and testified before our 
Science Committee. This is the group 
that believes that greenhouse emissions, 
primarily CO2 produced by burning 
these fossil fuels which were sequestered 
away, some believe as much 
as millions of years ago when the sun 
shone on subtropical seas, as in the 
North Sea, in ANWR, in Prudo Bay, 
very different world then. And the 
algae-like organisms grew and dropped 
to the bottom and silt came in and the 
tectonic plates opened up, this is the 
conjecture of how we got our gas and 
oil. And this was moved down to a 
depth where there was the right temperature, 
the right pressure with a 
rock dome over the top to contain the 
gas, which is why you don’t find gas 
and oil everywhere; that with time this 
then was converted into gas and the 
volatiles, of course, were oil. Well, 
these are the climate change, the global 
warming people who really want to 
move from fossil fuels to the renew-
ables. Because when you are using a renewable, 
you release the same amount 
of CO2 perhaps, but that’s the CO2 that 
was sequestered in the spring. If you’re 
burning this in the fall, you are releasing 
the CO2 that was sequestered in the 
spring and summer while the plant was 
growing, so there is no net increase, 
it’s simply recycling of the CO2. So this 
is the second group that has common 
cause. 

A third group that has common cause 
are the peak oil people. And this is a 
classic name here, Hubbert. In 1956, M. 
King Hubbert predicted that the United 
States would peak in oil production in 
1970. That was considered to be totally 
ridiculous. The United States was then 
king of oil, producing I think more oil 
than any other, and exporting a lot of 
oil at that time. And just as he predicted, 
in 1970 we peaked in oil production, 
and we’ve been going downhill 
ever since. 

The red curve here, by the way, is the 
Soviet Union. They kind of fell apart 
when they came unglued and now they 
are going to have a second small peak. 
And a little later we will have a chart 
which shows you relatively the amount 
of oil which each of the major oil-producing 
countries in the world has. 

We have two bills, and my next slide 
is one of those. This is a bill which our 
office has filed. This is to support Federal 
research development demonstration 
and commercial application activities 
to enable the development of 
self-powered farms. Our rationale is 
that if a farm can’t be energy independent, 
we face a very grim future. 

b 2100 
This is because as fossil fuels become 
less and less available, we have to 
move more and more to alternative 
fuels. Many of those are going to be 
produced on the farm, so if the farm 
can’t be energy independent, we are 
going to have some tough times ahead. 
So this bill challenges our American 
farmers to become independent, and 
there will be prizes for doing that. 

The second one is a broad act, America’s 
Energy for America’s Future, the 
bipartisan DRIVE Act as it is called, 
the acronym, Dependence Reduction 
Through Innovation in Vehicles and 
Energy Act, H.R. 60. So there are a 
number of bills before Congress. These 
are two important ones. 

What I want to do now is to go 
through three reports that we have 
had, the first one in February of 2005, 
the second one in September of 2005 
and the third one just released in February 
of 2007. These reports all say, and 
I have a few slides from each of these 
so you can see, Mr. Speaker, that they 
were delivering the same message to 
the American people. Paraphrasing 
what they said, each of these studies 
concluded that peaking of oil is imminent, 
if not present, with potentially 
devastating consequences. 

Let’s look at the first slide. This is 
from the Hirsch Report. The first of 
these reports, February of 2005, is the 
Peaking of Oil Production: Impacts, 
Mitigation and Risk Management. This 
is by the very big, prestigious SAIC, 
Science Applications International 
Corporation, and Robert Hirsch was 
the project leader, so this is frequently 
referred to as the Hirsch Report. 

These are some quotes from that report. 
They said that ‘‘the peaking of 
world oil production presents the 
United States especially and the world 
generally with an unprecedented risk 
management problem.’’ Unprecedented. 
That ‘‘the economic, social and political 
costs will be unprecedented.’’ 

Another authority in this area, Kenneth 
Deffeyes, says that ‘‘the least bad 
outcome of oil peaking will be a deep 
worldwide recession that may make 
the thirties look like good times.’’ 
Then he goes on to say, ‘‘If you don’t 
like that, try the Four Horsemen of the 
Apocalypse: War, famine, pestilence 
and death.’’ 

A second chart here from the Hirsch 
Report, and I will just read the highlighted 
part here, ‘‘oil peaking presents 
a unique challenge,’’ they say. And 
then they make the statement ‘‘the 
world has never faced a problem like 
this.’’ There is no precedent in history 
to guide us. Unprecedented. ‘‘The world 
has never faced a problem like this.’’ 

The next chart is another quote from 
the Hirsch Report. ‘‘We cannot conceive 
of any affordable government-
sponsored crash program to accelerate 
normal replacement schedules.’’ 

What they are talking about, any 
program that would provide energy 
from other sources to make up for the 
energy that won’t be there once we 
have reached peak oil production, and 
the world’s demand for energy keeps 
going up at about 2 percent, doubles in 
35 years, four times bigger in 70 years. 

The next chart shows us we are not 
going to drill our way out of this. This 
is a very interesting chart. When the 
Reagan Administration came in, we 
knew that M. King Hubbert was right. 
We were already 10 years down the 
other side in 1980, it peaked in 1970. Ten 


H4280 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

years down the other side of Hubbert’s 
Peak, and we knew something was 
wrong. 

What the administration proposed, 
and this was my second favorite president, 
by the way, but he was wrong in 
this. What the administration proposed 
was to incent the American oil producers 
to go out and drill for oil. So we 
gave them some tax incentives. This is 
what the drilling was, and, boy, did 
they drill. But notice, the more they 
drilled, the less oil they got, because 
we went from positive, producing a bit 
more than we needed, to negative, not 
producing as much. If the oil is not 
there, drilling won’t find it. 

By the way, we really drill for oil in 
our country. We have drilled more 
wells in our country than all the rest 
of the world put together. In spite of 
drilling all those oil wells, currently I 
think 530,000 operating wells, 4,000 
wells in the Gulf of Mexico, more than 
four times as many as all the wells in 
Saudi Arabia, in spite of that, we have 
not reversed the prediction of M. King 
Hubbert that our country would peak 
in 1970, and then it was down, down, 
down. 

The next chart is a schematic which 
I think depicts the situation and where 
we are. This is a 2 percent growth here. 
By the way, you can make this very 
steep, we simply compress the abscissa, 
or make it very shallow, this has a 
long scale on the abscissa. But it doubles 
in 35 years. This has been following 
a roughly 2 percent increase in 
use. Obviously, up until today we have 
been able to produce as much oil as we 
are using. It costs more because there 
are some tentative shortages. That is 
why the price of oil has gone up. 

So once we get near the peak and the 
demand keeps going up and the production 
is leveling off, that yellow area 
represents a gap between the amount 
of oil which is available, the green part 
of the curve, and the amount of oil we 
would like to use, which is this ever-increasing 
2 percent growth rate. 

Many people believe that what we 
ought to do is to fill that gap. I don’t 
think, Mr. Speaker, we can fill the gap, 
and I don’t think it would be productive 
to try to fill the gap, because there 
is only so many options out there for 
filling the gap. 

I have 10 children, 15 grandchildren, 
and 2 great grandchildren. Wouldn’t it 
be nice if I left them a little energy? 
Which is why I don’t vote to drill in 
ANWR and I don’t vote to drill offshore 
until they convince me that the energy 
they get from those projects is going to 
be invested in alternatives. Because we 
have known for 27 years, since 1980, we 
have known that M. King Hubbert was 
right about the United States. We 
peaked in 1970. Down, down, down since 
then. He predicted that the world 
would be peaking about now. 

I ask you, Mr. Speaker, if he was 
right about the United States, which is 
clearly a microcosm of the world, why 
shouldn’t he be right about the world 
and why shouldn’t we be doing something 
about that? 

Well, in their report, I think unwisely, 
the Hirsch Report looked at 
ways of filling the gap. The next chart 
shows a stylized approach at filling the 
gap. 

What it shows is when you decide to 
start doing these things, you won’t get 
anything for quite a while. We have, 
what, about 31/2 years before you get 
anything. So you have to anticipate 
the need before you start. 

Notice that enhanced oil recovery, 
coal to liquid, heavy oil, gas to liquid, 
these are all finite resources. They 
won’t last all that long. The only renewable 
one, the only one that will 
continue there is efficient vehicles. So 
they now are trying to fill the gap with 
clearly finite resources. There is only 
so much oil. If you get it there, it 
won’t be there later. There is only so 
much coal. If you liquify it now, you 
won’t liquify it tomorrow. There is 
only so much heavy oil. If you use it 
now, you won’t be using it later. 

The second chart from the Hirsch Report 
shows something very interesting, 
and we don’t have time this evening to 
look at all of the information on this 
chart. But they are making an assumption 
here, which this is repeated from 
the Energy Information Agency, this is 
not what the Hirsch Report is predicting, 
by the way. They are repeating 
information from the Energy Information 
Agency. And somehow the Energy 
Information Agency, which stands not 
quite alone, but near live alone in this 
view, believes that we will find as 
much more oil as all the oil that now 
exists which is recoverable. 

If we find that much oil, it will simply 
push peaking out to 2016. This 
chart was in 2000, and if we didn’t find 
any more oil, it was going to peak then 
and start down, which is about what M. 
King Hubbert had predicted. 

By the way, conventional oil probably 
peaked about then, but we are 
now getting a lot of oil from things 
like the Canadian tar sands, the heavy 
oils, the heavy sour oils and so forth. 
So we are now getting a fair amount of 
oil from what is called unconventional 
oil sources. But the conventional oil 
probably has already peaked. 

They show another very interesting 
thing here, that if you use enhanced oil 
recovery and get it more quickly, you 
may move the peak out, what, about 20 
years. But notice what happens after 
that. You can’t pump it later if you 
pumped it now, and look how it falls 
off after they have used enhanced oil 
recovery to get it sooner. 

The next chart is a very interesting 
one. This is projections by the Energy 
Information Agency. There is a lot we 
could talk about on these charts, because 
they are using data from the 
USGS and the USGS was using a frequency 
thing, which somehow gets 
translated to P here. I guess if you 
don’t write clearly, F can look like a P. 
I have no idea how they got from frequency 
to P. 

They say that we have three possibilities 
for the amount of oil that we 

are going to find in the future. The P is 
for probability. They say that there is 
the 95 percent probability. They say 
the mean is the 50 percent probability, 
if in fact it is probability. Obviously if 
it is 95 percent probable, it is a whole 
lot more probable than 50 percent probable. 
But they somehow take these frequency 
figures that USGS used, and 
what they did with frequency was simply 
make a lot of assumptions and they 
ran models from these assumptions and 
they ran these things many times and 
they got different numbers. So the frequency 
indicates the number of times 
that they predicted that quantity of 
oil. So this has to do only with their 
simulations and not with reality in the 
field. 

But somehow Energy Information 
Agency translated the F to P and to 95 
percent probability, 50 percent probability, 
which they said was the mean. 
Now, if it is a frequency thing, the 50 
percent thing could be the mean, but in 
probabilities it doesn’t make any 
sense. 

They were predicting in, what, a little 
bit before 2000, that if it followed 
the 95 percent probability, you would 
get that much oil. If you followed the 
50 percent probability, it would follow 
this line, which they said was the most 
probable. And the 5 percent probability 
would follow this line. 

What they didn’t do, of course, was to 
include the other half. When you see 
the path of a hurricane it is a pretty 
narrow for today. Tomorrow it will be 
uncertain, because we are uncertain 
about it. The 50 percent has another 
line which goes down here and the 5 
percent another line that goes down 
here. Really a big funnel. If you are 
only 5 percent certain what the future 
is going to be, obviously it is a big 
range that you are looking at. 

But look at what the actual data 
points follow. The actual data points 
follow, as you would expect them to, 
follow the 95 percent probability, because 
that is what 95 percent probability 
means. It is more probable than 
50 percent probability. 

The next chart shows, and this again 
is from the Hirsch Report, we are going 
to go over two more of these reports 
quickly. This is the Hirsch Report. 
They here have listed the projections 
of some of the world’s experts on when 
we would reach peak oil. 

Notice this first group, 2007, 2009, 
2007, 2009, 2010, 2010, then 2010 to 2020, 
and then a couple of them, one no visible 
peak and then CERA and Shell say 
it would be after 2020 or 2025 or after. 

The next chart shows a very interesting 
chart produced by Cambridge 
Research Associates. This is the CERA, 
Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
They produced this chart to try 
to convince the reader that they 
shouldn’t have any confidence in the 
predictions of M. King Hubbert. Let’s 
look at this. 

The total U.S. production is the red. 
The green is the actual lower 48, which, 
by the way, is what M. King Hubbert 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4281 

predicted. He didn’t have in his prediction 
any oil from Alaska or any oil 
from the Gulf of Mexico. He was looking 
just at the lower 48. And the yellow 
ones here are Hubbert’s lower 48 prediction. 


He said that it would follow a curve 
like this, and the lower 48 actually followed 
a curve as shown by the green 
squares there, and CERA says that 
proves that M. King Hubbert was wrong 
and you shouldn’t have any confidence 
in it. I think the average person looking 
at that says, gee, those green ones 
are pretty darn close to the yellow 
ones and he may a pretty good prediction, 
didn’t he? 

Now why did the red ones deviate 
from it? That is because we found a 
bunch of oil in Prudo Bay. A fourth of 
our total oil production came from 
Prudo Bay. So there was a little kick 
here in it. But notice, down, down, 
down after that. There was just a blip 
in the slide down the other side of 
Hubbert’s Peak produced by this huge 
oil find in Prudo Bay from which a 
fourth of our oil has come from the last 
number of years. And you can’t even 
see there the contribution of that fabled 
oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico 
which is now being pumped by about 
4,000 wells. 

The next chart is a chart by CERA, 
and they put this in an article in which 
they said that this whole peak oil notion 
was a farce and them are debunking 
it. But, boy, when I looked at that 
chart, it looks like it has a peak to me. 
It goes up and it goes down. And they 
said it is going to be an undulating plateau. 


b 2115 
By the way, they now are predicting, 
using the USGS figures, that we are 
going to find as much oil as all the oil 
that exists which is recoverable in the 
world. 
Leherrere says that this is absolutely 
implausible considering all the advances 
we have had in discovery of oil, 
computer modeling and 3–D seismic 
and so forth. 
If we don’t find that extra oil, and 
you can make up your mind whether 
you think we are going to find it or 
not, we would have been peaking about 
here. Boy, that is about now, isn’t it. 
If we find much more oil, we will be 
peaking later. They have an enormous 
amount of oil from unconventional 
there. Maybe, maybe not. We are getting 
a million barrels a day from the 
Canadian tar sands. That is a part of 
the 84–85 million barrels a day that we 
are burning, a little more than 1 percent. 
And that is not sustainable because 
they are using huge amounts of 
energy from natural gas which will run 
out. The vein will shortly be ducking 
under a big overlay so they will have to 
develop it in situ rather than shovel it 
out with a shovel that shovels 100 tons, 
they dump it in a truck that holds 400 
tons, and they take it and cook it to 
get this real heavy, stiff oil out. When 
it flows, they then mix it with a vola


tile so it will keep flowing in the pipelines. 
They know it is not sustainable, 
and they are going to run out of natural 
gas. They are thinking about 
building a nuclear power plant; and, 
furthermore, shortly they will need to 
develop in situ and they have no idea 
how to do that. 

Now we are going to look at some 
charts from the second study. All three 
of these studies are saying essentially 
the same thing: The peaking is either 
present or imminent with potentially 
devastating consequences if we don’t 
do something about it. 

The question everybody needs to be 
asking is why aren’t we doing anything 
meaningful about this? We are barely 
nibbling at the margins of the problem, 
and this is a huge problem. 

The U.S. Corps of Engineers, experts 
Colin Campbell, Jean LaHerrere, Brian 
Fleay, Roger Blanchard, Richard Duncan, 
Walter Youngquist and Albert 
Bartlett, who is no relative of mine, 
and I wish I had some of his genes. If 
you do a Google search for Albert Bartlett 
and energy, you will pull up the 
most fascinating one-hour lecture I 
have ever heard. He has given it over 
1,600 times. It is honed to perfection. 
You will be fascinated by it. Please 
pull it up and read that article. 

They have all estimated that a peak 
in oil production will occur around 
2005. This is concurred with by the 
CEOs of several companies. 

The next chart is another one from 
the Corps of Engineers, and they are 
quoting Jean Leherrere. The USGS estimate 
implies a fivefold increase in 
discovery rate and reserve addition for 
which no evidence is presented. This is 
his quote. ‘‘Such an improvement in 
performance is, in fact, utterly implausible 
given the great technological 
achievements of the industry over the 
past 20 years, the worldwide search, 
and the deliberate effort to find the 
largest remaining prospects.’’ 

This is a repeat of the chart that we 
just looked at. It shows the peaking 
currently if we don’t find this additional 
oil, and it shows that if we find 
as much more oil as all of the oil we 
have found now, that the peak is 
pushed out to only 2030 or so. It is most 
unlikely that will happen. 

Another chart from the Corps of Engineers 
study, this is the second of 
these big studies, let me just refer to 
the underlying part. ‘‘A careful review 
of all of the estimates leads to the conclusion 
that world oil production may 
peak within a few short years after 
which it will decline. Once peak oil occurs, 
then the historic patterns of 
world oil demand and price cycles will 
cease.’’ With limited supply, the price 
of oil will go who knows where. 

The next chart, again from the Corps 
of Engineers study, ‘‘Oil is the most 
important form of energy in the world 
today. Historically, no other energy 
source equals oil’s intrinsic qualities of 
extractability, transportability, 
versatility and cost. The qualities that 
enabled oil to take over from coal as 

the frontline energy source for the industrialized 
world in the middle of the 
20th century are as relevant today as 
they were then.’’ 

Just a word about the quality of this 
oil. One barrel of oil has the energy 
equivalent of 12 people working all 
year. You pay just a little over $100 for 
it refined. You are hiring the equivalent 
of a person working for you for a 
whole year for less than $10. If you 
have some trouble getting your mind 
around that, imagine how far that gallon 
of gasoline or diesel, still cheaper, 
by the way at $3 a gallon than water in 
the grocery store, how far that takes 
your car or your SUV. 

I drive a Prius. A gallon takes me 
about 50 miles. How long would it take 
me to pull my Prius 50 miles? I can’t 
pull it unless it is on the level, and 
then I work really hard and go very 
slowly. If it is uphill, I couldn’t do it 
without a come-along and hooking it 
to the guardrail or a tree or something 
and inching it up the hill. How long 
would it take me to pull my Prius that 
50 miles that a gallon takes me. 

Another way of looking at the quality 
of fossil fuels is to recognize that if 
a strong man works hard all day, you 
can get more work out of an electric 
motor for less than 25 cents worth of 
electricity. That may be humbling to 
recognize that we are worth less than 
25 cents a day in terms of fossil fuel energy; 
but that is why they say in this 
report, ‘‘Historically, no other energy 
source equals oil’s intrinsic qualities.’’ 

My next chart, this is a fairly recent 
article and they say, ‘‘The current 
price of oil is in the $45–57 per barrel 
range.’’ It is now $64, $65, $66. ‘‘It is expected 
to stay in that range for several 
years.’’ It didn’t, it went up to $78. It 
has now dropped. There was a fear factor 
that looks like it was about $18 because 
it pretty quickly dropped from 
$78 to $60 when the fear factor went 
away. 

Oil prices may go significantly higher 
and some have predicted $180 a barrel 
in a few years. This is from the 
Corps of Engineers study, and they are 
a very credible organization. 

Now I am going to move to a third 
study, a GAO study. I asked for this 
study because I wanted to see if it corroborated 
the conclusions drawn by the 
other two studies. This one came out in 
February 2007, and it was embargoed 
for 30 days and then it came out a 
month or so ago. ‘‘Crude oil. Uncertainty 
about future oil supply makes it 
important to develop a strategy for addressing 
a peak and decline in oil production.’’ 


This is their curve for Hubbert’s 
peak, peaking about 1970. This is the 
increased production from Prudhoe 
Bay, but down, down, down. Now we 
are at about half of the oil we were producing 
in 1970. That is in spite of the 
fact that we have drilled more oil wells 
than all of the rest of the world put together. 


The next chart is very interesting. 
This chart has only the top 10. We are 


H4282 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

not in the top 10. This lists the top 10 
companies on the basis of oil production 
and reserves. Here it is on the 
basis of production and reserves. 

Our big oil companies, ExxonMobil, 
Royal Dutch Shell, BP, you see those 
names on the pumps, they produce this 
much. They don’t even appear in the 
top 10 over here. They don’t have any 
meaningful oil reserves. They are 
pumping somebody else’s oil. The top 
10 reserves over here are Luke Oil, 2 
percent, and then all of the rest of the 
top 10 are guess where, Saudi Aramco, 
National Iranian, Iraq National, Kuwait, 
Venezuela, Dubai, and so forth. 
Libya, Nigeria. 

The next chart shows the same kind 
of data in a pie chart. Some people like 
to look at pie charts. This is the world 
oil reserves, OPEC and non-OPEC nations. 


Now we have blown up the OPEC nations 
here to see who owns most of the 
oil. Obviously Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, 
Venezuela and so forth contain 
the oil there. By the way, Saudi Arabia 
is not included in that pie chart because 
it is so big it stands alone. 

The next chart shows pictorially 
what these have shown in these little 
pie charts. This is what the world 
would look like, the world according to 
oil, and this is what the geography of 
the world would look like if the nation 
had square miles relative to the 
amount of oil it has. If the amount of 
oil determined the size of a country, 
this is what our world would look like. 

Boy, look at Saudi Arabia. It dominates 
everything. The United States, 
we are squeezed over here, but we are 
in good shape compared to India. Look 
at India with a billion people and China 
with 1.3 billion. Boy, are they dependent 
on somebody else’s oil. 

Russia, a huge oil exporter, but they 
don’t have that much oil compared to 
the Middle East countries. This is very 
sobering. What it shows is that most of 
the oil in the world, and the President 
said it very well in his State of the 
Union message, most of the oil in the 
world is controlled by countries that 
don’t even like us. Just look at the 
names of these countries, and you can 
figure that out. 

Venezuela dwarfs us. They have several 
times as much oil as we have. 
Alaska, that is pretty big, a half or 
third of what we have in the lower 48. 

The next chart, this is from a very 
interesting speech that I hope to spend 
an hour talking about next week here 
on the floor. It was given 50 years ago 
by Hyman Rickover in 1957. He said 
some really fascinating things in that 
speech. 

Mr. Speaker, you will be amazed at 
how prophetic Hyman Rickover was. 
He is the father of our nuclear submarine. 
We generally think of him in 
that venue, but he was wise beyond his 
time relative to energy. You will be 
amazed at the predictions and observations 
he made. 

‘‘High energy consumption has always 
been a prerequisite of political 

power.’’ Boy, look at where the political 
power is going to be if political 
power is relative to the amount of 
enery you have. Just think of that last 
chart that we looked at. 

‘‘Ultimately, the nation which controls 
the largest energy resources will 
become dominant.’’ I read that and I 
thought of China who is now going 
around the world buying oil wherever 
they can find it for sale. In terms of 
the economies of buying oil, whoever 
has the dollars today buys it and it 
doesn’t matter who owns it. That may 
change in the future. That may be a 
very true statement in the future. 

‘‘If we act wisely and in time to conserve 
what we have,’’ and we obviously 
didn’t do that. I have made the observation 
that when we found that incredible 
wealth in the ground, we should 
have stopped as a culture and asked: 
What can we do with this to get the 
most good for the most people for the 
longest time? That is clearly not what 
we did. 

With no more responsibility than the 
hog who found the feed room door open 
or the kids who found the cookie jar, 
we just pigged out. We want to continue 
doing that. The call now is to 
drill, drill, drill. 

As I mentioned earlier, I have 10 
kids, 15 grandkids, and 2 great-
grandkids. I am going to leave them an 
incredible debt. Not with my votes. 
Look at them, and I didn’t do it. But 
am I also going to leave them a world 
largely devoid of easily accessible energy, 
which is why, again, I don’t vote 
to drill in ANWR and offshore. 

‘‘If we act wisely and in time to conserve 
what we have and prepare well 
for the necessary future changes, we 
shall ensure this dominant position for 
our own country.’’ 

We haven’t done that. 

b 2130 
Because we have not done that, we 
now have a real challenge. By the way, 
I have no doubt that the American people, 
with proper leadership, which I do 
not see a whole lot of for the moment, 
can meet this challenge. We are the 
most creative, innovative society in 
the world. 
A couple of real quick charts here because 
our time is running out. 
This chart looks at proven oil reserves 
by investment risk, and about a 
third of this pie chart; there is no investment 
because it is not allowed by 
the companies that own it. Then there 
is high investment risk. In some of the 
other countries, you make an investment 
risk like Hugo Chavez just did. 
They take the facilities away from you 
and nationalize them. There is a tiny 
piece of the pie chart here that has a 
low investment risk. 
The next one looks at political risk, 
how unstable are these countries, what 
is the political risk. Boy, more than a 
third of it high risk, nearly a third of 
it minimum risk. So you look at these 
two risks, and that really means that 
we need to look carefully at the future. 

Next chart, and this is an interesting 
one. This is a prediction of when we 
will peak. Now, several authorities 
here do not have any idea exactly 
when, but they said it could occur as 
early as this and maybe as late as that, 
but all of these have occurred before 
2020. All of these have occurred before 
2020. Very few believe that peaking 
could not occur before 2020. 

The next chart, and I wish we had 
more time to look at this because this 
is a fascinating chart. This chart shows 
the discovery of oil. These bar graphs 
are the discovery. Obviously you add 
up all those bars, you will get the total 
amount of oil that we have found. You 
will get the same thing if you put a 
smooth curve over there. The area 
under the curve will equal the oil we 
have found. 

The solid black line here is the oil we 
have used. Now, obviously up until 
about 1980 we were finding more than 
we use, but since then, we have been 
borrowing from what we found and we 
are now peaking. 

And what will the future look like? 
They are predicting here we will find it 
not smooth like that, but on average 
that much, less and less. Most experts 
believe, by the way, we have found 
about 95 percent of all the oil we will 
find. 

What will the future look like? We 
can change a little of the detail, but we 
cannot pump what is not there. If you 
use enhanced oil recovery, you may extend 
this out a little bit and it will 
drop off very quickly, as you saw on 
that chart. 

The next chart is one which I really 
think is very productive to look at, and 
Hyman Rickover mentions this. In 
8,000 years of recorded history, and we 
have here only the last 400 or so years 
of recorded history, roughly 400 years, 
but in 8,000 years of recorded history, 
the age of oil will occupy about 300 
years. We have been about 150 years 
into the age of oil. Hyman Rickover in 
his speech of 50 years ago said that we 
are about 100 years in what will be 
called a golden age, and clearly it has 
been a golden age. 

World population, if we put it on this 
chart, exploded at just about that rate, 
and if we reach peak oil, it will drop off 
the other side as quick as we have gone 
up. Notice what happened in the 1970s, 
Arab oil shock, more efficiency. If that 
had not happened, by the way, we 
would be in even more trouble today 
because up until the Carter years we 
had used as much oil every decade as 
we had used in all of previous history. 
That means if we had used half the oil, 
which is I think where we are now, you 
would have 10 years at current use 
rate. 

Well, what do we do? I would just 
like to note in the remaining minutes 
that we have here, that I believe America 
is up to this challenge. There is no 
exhilaration like the exhilaration in 
meeting a big problem and overcoming 
it, and properly motivated, we are the 
most creative, innovative society in 
the world. 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4283 

I said there were five groups early on. 
I mentioned only two of them. The two 
other groups that have common cause 
in moving to alternatives, one of those 
is the environmentalists that believe 
that our air is polluted enough; why 
would you want to burn more fossil 
fuels and pollute it more. The other is 
a group who is longing for a return to 
dominance in manufacturing. We are 
very creative. We could become a 
major exporter of the technology for 
exploiting these renewable alternative 
sources. 

So there are these five groups. I do 
not want to argue with whether we 
have global warming or not because 
what they want to do for global warming 
is exactly what we need to do for 
peak oil. It is exactly what we need to 
do for national security. It is exactly 
what we need to do to clean up our air. 
It is exactly what we need to do to 
have some manufacturing superiority 
again. So these five groups have common 
cause. 

We need to buy time by an aggressive 
conservation program. We need to use 
it wisely, to invest the time and energy 
in renewables that will pay off. The 
benefits, of course, I have indicated. 
We will now be a major exporting country 
again. 

The last chart, and I am sorry we do 
not have time to look at this more, but 
we are very much, and I will close with 
this, like the young couple that has 
gotten a big inheritance. Fifteen percent 
of what they spend they earn, 85 
percent is from the inheritance, and it 
is going to run out. Fifteen percent of 
what we use, more than half of that nuclear 
power, is renewables. The 85 percent 
is fossil fuels which will not last. 
So the big challenge is the challenge 
the young couple has. Obviously in the 
future they are going to have to either 
spend less or earn more, and that is exactly 
the challenge we have. 

Last chart, and I really want to look 
at this one in the moments we have 
here. It is not like we are going to be 
living in a world that is not comfortable. 
Interesting chart here, it 
shows on the ordinate how satisfied 
you are with life. On the abscissa, it 
shows the amount of energy you consume. 
We are way out there in the far 
right. We use more energy per capita 
than anybody else in the world. But notice, 
all these countries, 20 some of 
them that use less energy than we, 
which are happier with their station in 
life than we are. You do not need to use 
the amount of energy we use to be 
happy. 

We have a really challenging future. 
I think we are up to it with proper 
leadership. 

f 

IMMIGRATION POLICY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
COHEN). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 18, 2007, the 
gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER) 
is recognized for 60 minutes. 
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, 
today was May Day, and there were 

demonstrations across America in 
favor of a more open immigration policy, 
an immigration policy that I 
might add has already resulted in 15 to 
20 million illegals being present in our 
society. The American people need to 
pay very close attention to this issue. 

Several weeks ago, the President of 
the United States took advantage with 
Congress being out of session to give a 
major immigration policy speech down 
along the border in Arizona. Flanked 
by dozens of border patrol officers, 
President Bush stuck to the usual 
script, securing the border, yes, but 
first a guest worker program must be 
set up that includes giving Social Security 
benefits to illegals, to those people 
who have been working here illegally, 
and of course, part of the program 
must be to legalize the status of those 
millions of illegal immigrants who already 
reside in our country. 

I have observed in my 30 years in 
Washington that when a President initiates 
a major policy speech on a controversial 
issue while Congress is in recess, 
it usually is because what he is 
advocating is indefensible and that he 
is seeking to minimize criticism. 

While the President was posturing 
with the border patrol, we Members 
were back in our districts listening to 
the pleas of our constituents. The 
American people are begging their government 
to save their families from 
the onslaught of illegal immigration. 

Instead of meeting with America’s 
elite who live behind gates and work at 
corporate boardrooms and whose kids 
attend private schools, President Bush 
should be talking to people who are 
watching their children’s public 
schools, their community hospitals and 
the security of their own neighborhoods 
being brought down by a massive 
flow of foreigners, illegally establishing 
themselves in our country. 

If this President pushes through his 
so-called comprehensive immigration 
plan, which will legalize the status of 
those who have broken our laws and 
are in this country illegally, America’s 
current 15 to 20 million illegal residents 
within a decade will mushroom 
to another 40 to 50 million. 

Wake up, America. We are about to 
lose our country. Wake up, America. 
The President and Congress are not 
watching out for you. 

The comprehensive immigration legislation 
that is being bandied around 
town by this President and by Members 
of Congress will be a green light to 100 
million people throughout the world to 
do anything they can do to get to our 
country because we do not have the 
will to stop them. No matter how impenetrable 
the defense, no matter how 
diligent the border patrol, there will be 
no stopping them. Give them benefits, 
give them jobs, give them health care, 
give them every right to the treasures 
that belong to the citizens and legal 
immigrants who are in our country and 
they will come from overseas, and 
there will be nothing that we can do to 
stop them because we have given them 

the greatest incentive to come here, 
even though they are breaking our 
laws in doing so. 

Tens of millions of new illegals are 
bringing down the wages of our middle 
class, some carrying disease right into 
our schools and communities, some 
criminals, many in need of Social Security, 
education and health benefits, 
all to be taken, of course, from the resources 
that are dedicated to Americans 
so that our American people and 
legal immigrants will have these resources 
available to them. That is 
where all of that is going to come from. 
Who is going to pay the price? The 
American people will pay the price, not 
the American elite, the American people. 


Wake up, America. You are about to 
be assaulted, and your elected representatives 
are not on your side. No 
one will stop the horde if this so-called 
comprehensive bill goes through. Who 
is going to stop them? Not the border 
patrol. 

And what about the border patrol, 
America’s most important defense in 
this battle against such an invasion? 
While the President stood with border 
patrol agents down in the Yuma sector 
in Arizona, praising them for their 
hard work, saying how proud he was of 
them, the border patrol agents were 
painfully aware that two of their fellow 
officers languish in Federal prisons. 
They are being held in solitary confinement 
for doing their job, the job that 
the President claims he wants the border 
patrol agents to do. 

It is the President’s appointees who 
have perpetrated upon this border patrol 
the worst miscarriage of justice 
that I have ever witnessed. Ignoring 
pleas for mercy and pleas for justice, 
ignoring the clear misconduct of his 
prote´ge´, U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton, 
the President has backed up his employees 
at the expense of border patrol 
agents, especially these two, Ramos 
and Compeon. 

The President has permitted his Justice 
Department to throw the book at 
these two border patrol agents for stopping 
a drug dealer, and perhaps, just 
perhaps, maybe there was some procedural 
errors that they were involved in. 
This administration turned what is, at 
worst, procedural violations, that they 
did not file the reports, even though 
there are questions as to whether their 
supervisors should have filed the reports 
or not; in fact, the rule states 
that the supervisors will file such reports, 
that this administration has 
turned that lack of proper paperwork 
into felonies that have put Ramos and 
Compeon, two border patrol agents who 
have well-served our country, defended 
our families with their lives, they are 
now languishing in prison for 11 years 
of hard time. 

President Bush backs up his appointees 
who either incompetently or 
maliciously chose to prosecute our law 
enforcement officers, while at the same 
time, I might add, chose to grant immunity 
to the drug smuggler who they 
stopped. 


H4284 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton claims 
that he had no choice in this matter, 
the biggest lie of all. U.S. Attorney 
Johnny Sutton had plenty of choices to 
make, and as a prosecutor, that is what 
prosecutors do. They make mistakes 
on who to prosecute. That is one of the 
fundamental decisions they have to 
make. He was faced with a decision, either 
prosecute the drug dealer who had 
$1 million worth of drugs that he was 
smuggling into our country, or prosecute 
the border patrol agents by turning 
their procedural mistakes into 
breaking the law, and thus, into felonies 
for supposedly covering up the 
breaking of the law. 
Our U.S. Attorney chose to give immunity 
to the drug smuggler who was, 
of course, smuggling $1 million worth 
of drugs into our country, but not to 
give immunity to the border patrol 
agents for procedural missteps. 

b 2145 
That was his decision. He decided, 
our U.S. Attorney decided to back the 
drug smuggler and destroy the Border 
Patrol agents, and he knew exactly 
how that decision would affect the 
lives of Ramos and Compeon. 
Agents Ramos and Compeon should 
have been commended for their courageous 
service in stopping an illegal 
drug smuggler from bringing in over $1 
million worth of drugs into our communities. 
If they had stopped a terrorist 
with a nuclear bomb, I am sure 
by now they would be national heroes. 
Instead, the President refuses to take a 
sober look at the facts of this case and 
issue pardons for these men, the pardons 
that justice demands and the 
American people are crying out for, 
and the Border Patrol, throughout this 
country, is looking at as a sign whether 
this President supports the job they 
are doing. 
But, of course, they won’t issue any 
pardon. Even to let these men out on 
bond pending their appeal would require 
an admission that some loyal 
Bush appointee was wrong. 
Instead, the President continues to 
back his long-time buddy at the Justice 
Department, Johnny Sutton, even 
though the decision he made, instead of 
going after the drug dealer, to go after 
the Border Patrol agents and destroy 
their lives, was obviously a bad call. 
The President has ignored the rotten 
smell that is coming from this case. He 
has ignored the fact that the Department 
of Homeland Security operatives 
went to Congress and intentionally lied 
to Members of Congress on investigative 
subcommittees, claiming that 
Ramos and Compeon had joked about 
going out and shooting a Mexican the 
day they intercepted this drug dealer 
and the incident ensued. 
Ramos and Compeon are Mexican 
Americans. They are Americans of 
Mexican descent. Their wives are 
Americans of Mexican descent. Their 
children are Americans of Mexican descent. 
Yet we had members of the Department 
of Homeland Security from 

this administration lying to Congress 
saying these men wanted to go out and 
shoot Mexicans. They lied over and 
over again, and this administration has 
lied over and over again, dealing with 
the Ramos and Compean case. 

What we have here is a situation 
where the supervisors who were on the 
scene within minutes of them stopping 
this drug dealer, and when he escaped 
over the border, those supervisors did 
not ask Ramos and Compeon about the 
incident. Ramos and Compeon didn’t 
comment, because they knew that procedures 
were that they would have had 
to do 5 or 6 hours worth of more work, 
filling out more paperwork, bringing in 
the FBI. 

Both the supervisors and Ramos and 
Compeon knew that this would have 
just created a lot more work for them 
on their own time. They decided not to 
do it, because the guy had gotten away, 
so why report that shots were fired, 
and they didn’t even think they had hit 
him. 

Well, making it worse, of course, as 
we know, the supervisors, who were actually 
threatened by the U.S. attorneys, 
the prosecutors in this case, were 
threatened that if they did not testify 
against Ramos and Compeon, and 
claimed that, in fact, there was an attempt 
to cover up this incident, rather 
than just being a case of where they 
were trying not to have to put themselves 
in a position where they were 
going to have to do all this more paperwork, 
they threatened the supervisors 
to put them in jail. Of course, the supervisors 
buckled. They didn’t want 
their lives to be destroyed. 

Well, let me put it this way. What we 
have got here, failure to report, to file 
a report, is a procedural violation. It is 
not a crime. This U.S. Attorney chose 
to go after the Border Patrol agents instead 
of the drug dealer. He chose to 
make a procedural violation into a 
crime, into a felony. 

Again, threats were made against the 
supervisors, so what do you have there? 
A witness being threatened by the 
prosecution. We have seen this across 
our country. We know when prosecutors 
try to get somebody and squeeze 
them to say what’s the truth or not the 
truth in order to protect themselves. 
They will stretch the truth. 

So either they went along, the supervisors 
went along on the assault on 
Ramos or Compeon, or they too would 
be prosecuted. Everybody hears this, 
gets the picture. The whole thing 
stinks. Ramos and Compeon are taking 
a fall to demonstrate to all Border Patrol 
agents that if they use their guns 
to secure our borders, even from drug 
smugglers, they will be destroyed. 
They will be targeted and destroyed by 
this administration because that is 
this administration’s policy. 

Yes. Now, what does that policy 
mean? Where did that come from? If 
Border Patrol agents can’t use their 
guns at the border, how can we control 
our borders? 

Now, of course, the Border Patrol 
agents are afraid, and, rightfully so, to 

get out of their car if they see a potential 
drug dealer driving across. What a 
horrible message, what a horrible decision. 
Yet this President has to stick 
with his appointees. 

Clearly, border security is not a priority 
for this administration. There 
may be well some other priority at 
work, some other agenda that we don’t 
know about. Granting immunity to 
this drug smuggler, granting immunity 
to the people who smuggle drugs, 
human traffickers, which happened in 
another case, I might add, where another 
law enforcement officer ended up 
in jail, doing this, while granting immunity 
to the human traffickers and 
the drug smugglers, suggests the bizarre 
nature of this administration’s 
border and immigration policy. 

If anybody denies it or defies it who 
works for the Border Patrol or anyone 
else in the government, this administration, 
through Ramos and Compeon, 
through his prosecutors, have made it 
clear that anyone who defies their policies 
will be vilified and destroyed. 
Note, U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton, 
Johnny Sutton, the U.S. Attorney labeled 
Ramos and Compeon in the media 
as ‘‘corrupt.’’ There are quotes around 
corrupt. 

This is the U.S. Attorney himself, 
not the prosecutors who were filing or 
arguing the case. The U.S. Attorney labeled 
Ramos and Compeon corrupt, a 
clear lie. Neither of these two agents 
have ever been accused of corruption. 

Ramos, a 10-year veteran of the Border 
Patrol, an officer in the Naval Reserve, 
had been nominated Border Patrol 
agent of the year. He was nominated 
for that award. To be considered 
for that award, just prior to this incident, 
this is a corrupt officer? Ramos 
and Compeon are clean. They have 
never been accused of that. Yet the 

U.S. Attorney is on the radio calling 
them corrupt. 
Something stinks about that situation, 
doesn’t it. U.S. Attorney Johnny 
Sutton lied and claimed that Ramos 
and Compeon were corrupt, and then he 
threw the book at them. 

At the same time, he gave a professional 
drug smuggler a ‘‘get out of jail 
free’’ card and had his prosecutors lie 
to the jury telling them that the drug 
smuggler was a novice who was only 
trying to raise money to buy medicine 
for his sick mother. That’s what the 
jury was told when the prosecutors at 
that time knew, they made that argument 
to the jury, that this was a novice 
at one time to raise money for a 
sick mother, they knew that drug 
smuggler had already been involved in 
a second drug smuggling incident that 
they knew of. 

This is while he was under immunity 
for the load that he had been intercepted 
for bringing into the country by 
Ramos and Compeon. By the way, it’s 
not just Ramos and Compeon, of 
course. We are talking about a border 
and immigration policy by this administration 
that is bizarre, that is incomprehensible, 
that is totally confused 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4285 

and leads to many, many questions. 
Why is, for example, why is this President, 
if, yes, Border Patrol and immigration 
control issues are important to 
him? Why is the President holding the 
security of our borders hostage to, basically, 
making sure that we can’t proceed 
with defense and other border security 
measures unless we also pass a 
bill that includes the provision of legalizing 
the status of 15 to 20 million 
people who are already in this country 
illegally? 

What do those two issues have to do 
with one another? If he believes in the 
security of the border, why is he demanding 
also that in order to secure 
the border we have to legalize the status 
of 15 to 20 million illegals, by the 
way, which will lead to a massive 
hoard of new illegals, of course, that no 
fence will stop. No one is being fooled 
by this call for a comprehensive reform. 


It is a code word for amnesty, legalizing 
the status of those who are here 
illegally. The President has destroyed 
his own credibility by playing such 
word games as defining amnesty in a 
way such that nobody accepts the definition. 
It is a totally unacceptable and 
irrational definition of the word ‘‘amnesty.’’ 


Why the President has chosen over 
and over again to try to play that kind 
of word game, I don’t know. The chaotic 
and confused picture of this comprehensive 
border policy, and the 
things that are going on in our border, 
suggests that there are other forces 
that are at play. What are those forces? 
There are certainly very powerful interest 
groups that play here in Washington, 
and there may well be a hidden 
agenda that is being foisted on the 
American people. 

The President’s own words suggest 
this. During the February 14, 2007, 
press conference, President Bush said 
the following, ‘‘I believe that in order 
to enforce the borders, we need a temporary 
worker program so that people 
don’t try to sneak into the country to 
work, that they can come in an orderly 
fashion and take the pressure off the 
Border Patrol agents that we have got 
here so that the Border Patrol doesn’t 
focus on workers that are doing their 
jobs that Americans won’t do, but are 
focusing on terrorists and criminal elements, 
gun runners, et cetera, to keep 
the country, both of our countries, 
safe, Mexico and the United States, 
safe.’’ 

Mr. Speaker, I am not really sure 
that it’s the responsibility of the 
United States government, to have a 
high priority of keeping Mexico safe. 
Just what is being proposed, how will 
that affect Mexico at the expense of 
the American people? 

Just whose interest is our government 
representing? During his Yuma 
speech, the President proclaimed the 
border ‘‘should be open to trade and 
lawful immigration and shut down to 
criminals and drug dealers and terrorists 
and coyotes and smugglers and 
people who prey upon innocent life.’’ 

How does that square with the President’s 
U.S. Attorney and long-time 
friend and protege, Johnny Sutton, 
who he backs to the hilt, throwing the 
book at our Border Patrol agents and 
other law enforcement officers over 
procedural errors, but at the same time 
letting drug smugglers go, letting people 
who are smuggling illegal immigrations 
into our country go? 

Of course, that is not the only thing, 
Ramos and Compeon and what’s going 
on with our law enforcement. The policies 
themselves are incomprehensible. 

According to a recent AP story, 98 
percent of all illegal border crossers 
are not even prosecuted, 98 percent. Between 
October 1 of 2000 and September 
30 of 2006, nearly 5.3 million illegals 
were simply escorted back across the 
Rio Grande and turned loose. Well, no 
wonder they don’t give up, and they 
end up coming back a second or third 
or fourth time. 

The Justice Department claims it 
has ‘‘higher priorities than going after 
ordinary illegal immigrants.’’ They 
said they elected to pursue a more elective 
strategy going after drug smugglers 
and criminals. Really? Tell that 
to Border Patrol agents Ramos and 
Compeon, who are languishing right 
now, right now as we speak, in solitary 
confinement in Federal prisons, all because 
U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton, 
close friend and protege of the President, 
decided to grant immunity to the 
drug smuggler in order to testify 
against the Border Patrol agents. 

Not only did Sutton allow this criminal 
to get away with it once, as I stated, 
this very same drug smuggler was 
involved with a second shipment. He 
has probably been involved with many 
more shipments of drugs. 

But, they knew that he was involved 
with a second shipment even before 
Ramos and Compeon went to trial, and 
that information was kept from the 
jury. Let me repeat that, information 
that the very same drug smuggler that 
had been stopped by Ramos and 
Compeon, that very same man who now 
Ramos and Compeon are being tried for 
at that moment for violating procedures 
because he was just a novice, a 
man who had never done this before, 
this was his first attempt at drug 
smuggling. The fact that they knew of 
a second load that would have already 
happened by the time of the trial, that 
was kept from the jury. 

The jury was presented by the prosecutor, 
a lie, that this man was obviously 
a novice, and had never been involved 
in drug smuggling before. The 
jury was told the drug smuggler was, as 
I say, first-time novice, to pay for his 
mother’s medicine. 

b 2200 
And the U.S. Attorney knew that he 
had already been involved in a second 
drug load, and that was kept from the 
jury. Something really stinks about 
this case. This is the same U.S. Attorney 
that has been claiming all along, 
along with the prosecutors, that the 
drug smuggler wasn’t armed. 

Now, we know that both of the Border 
Patrol agents suggest that as the 
drug smuggler is running away from 
them to get across the border, he 
turned in a way that appeared to be 
aiming something in their direction, 
and they didn’t have much time to 
think about it and they fired their 
weapons. Now, whether or not he had a 
gun is impossible to prove. He got 
away. He went across the border. We 
have only the word of the drug smuggler 
that he was not armed. And, again, 
the drug smuggler is not only believed, 
but his story is backed up by the U.S. 
prosecutors over the word of two veteran 
law enforcement officers, one who 
served this country for 10 years in the 
Border Patrol, the other 5 years, both 
of them veterans of our military. And 
they believed the drug dealer, in order 
to destroy the Border Patrol agents. 
And then, again, we hear over and over 
again, and presented in trial, that the 
drug smuggler was unarmed. Yet it is 
only his word that suggests that. And I 
might add this; the drug smuggler’s 
family has stated to journalists that 
this drug smuggler had always been 
armed when smuggling drugs, and he 
had been doing so since he was 14 years 
old. 

Now, let’s put that in perspective. 
Does anyone really believe that a drug 
smuggler in that area is going to be in 
possession of a $1 million asset, these 
drugs, and he won’t have anything 
there to defend those assets on either 
side of the border? Our U.S. Attorney 
believes the drug smuggler when he 
says he is unarmed, and destroys the 
Border Patrol agents when they say 
they thought he was aiming something 
at them. To this day, the smuggler is 
free from prosecution. He has never 
been charged with a crime, and is 
awaiting a potential settlement in his 
$5 million lawsuit against the Border 
Patrol. 

Now, let’s recap. Two Border Patrol 
agents are languishing in solitary confinement 
in Federal prisons for 11 
years, while the illegal drug smuggler 
whose van was abandoned contained $1 
million worth of narcotics, he was 
granted immunity; he has been given 
free medical care, and provided an unconditional 
border crossing card, which 
was more than likely used when he 
smuggled a second stash of drugs into 
the United States before Ramos and 
Compean went to prison. And we are 
supposed to believe that this President 
wants to free up our Border Patrol 
agents from just normal duties so they 
can go after the real criminals? 

By the way, at Ramos and Compean’s 
trial the prosecutor belittled the Border 
Patrol agents for thinking that 
they should be out trying to stop drug 
smugglers. And that prosecutor, belittling 
them in front of the jury, said if 
they wanted to stop drug dealers, they 
should have joined the DEA, the Drug 
Enforcement Agency. This is our prosecutor 
that is supposed to be representing 
us belittling these two men 
for stopping a drug dealer with $1 million 
worth of drugs, saying that they 


H4286 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

should have gone and joined the DEA if 
they wanted to stop drug dealers. To 
suggest all of this represents a confused, 
chaotic, and contradictory border 
strategy and immigration policy is 
to put it mildly. 

During the Ramos and Compean 
trial, the lead prosecutor bragged how 
section 1325 cases are not even prosecuted. 
What are 1325 cases? Improper 
entry by an alien. It states any alien 
who enters or attempts to enter the 
United States at any time or any other 
than as designated by Immigration officers 
shall be fined under title XVIII 
or imprisoned for not more than 2 
years, or both. 

The law is clear, but the law is not 
being enforced. The law isn’t being enforced. 
Our Border Patrol agents are 
under attack even if they stop drug 
dealers, much less other people. The 
other people who are just coming 
across, we are not enforcing that. Millions 
have been returned without having 
to pay any penalty at all. So why 
not come back a second and third time 
until they succeed? 

And why isn’t the law being enforced? 
And because the law hasn’t 
been enforced, the situation at the border 
is out of control. Surprise, surprise. 
If you don’t enforce the law at the border, 
it’s out of control. Tens of millions 
of people are here who shouldn’t be 
here. 

Now, who is to blame? Yes, I think 
the top person in our government and 
all the people in our government who 
have been supporting these policies are 
to blame. Whether it is President Bush, 
President Clinton, or Members of leadership 
in Congress, the law hasn’t been 
enforced, and it has been very clear 
that it has not been enforced. This has 
not been an accident that we have 15 
million to 20 million illegals in our 
country creating horrible situations 
for driving down wages, destroying 
education, et cetera, et cetera. More 
and more people are coming across our 
borders without any type of consequence 
because it has been a policy 
not to enforce that law, the policy of 
this administration for the last 6 years. 
Of course, who did they prosecute but 
the Border Patrol agents if they didn’t 
do their paperwork right. 

Well, what is going, of course, we 
have more and more people crossing 
the border. Those who are here and get 
here illegally begin to realize that they 
are able to find work, and they are actually 
getting jobs that pay them more 
money than they would have in the 
countries from which they come, Guatemala, 
Mexico, El Salvador, China, 
and elsewhere. So they realize they can 
get work here and get paid more. And 
they also realize that they are able to 
get free services from the Federal, 
State, and local government. The taxpayers 
of the United States are going 
to provide them services they could 
never get at home, health care, education, 
housing, et cetera. It is a bonanza 
for these people. 

Now, they are not bad people. Let me 
state for the record and be very em


phatic about this. A huge proportion, 
maybe 90 percent of all illegal immigrants 
coming to this country are likely 
to be wonderful human beings. If we 
were in their spot, we would be coming 
across the border, too. They are not at 
fault for wanting to come here, and 
they are not at fault for coming here to 
better the lives of their families, to 
better their own lives. That’s not their 
fault. We don’t dislike them for that at 
all. The people to blame here, the people 
to be upset with are the policymakers 
who permitted this massive 
flow of people into our country; because, 
even though these are good people 
coming in, they are having a horrible 
impact on our society. A horrible 
impact. And it is up to us to represent 
the interests of the people of the 
United States, even though these good 
people who would like to come here by 
the tens of millions all around the 
world are good people. And my heart 
goes out to them. But my job and our 
job should be to protect the interests of 
the people of the United States. And 
there is nothing wrong with that. 
There is nothing selfish with that. 
There is nothing selfish with wanting 
to protect our children and make sure 
the health care and resources go to our 
children and our families. 

But the word has gone out all over 
the world that they can get jobs, they 
can get benefits. And I will tell you 
this. If the word goes out that we are 
going to legalize and we end up legalizing 
the status of those who are here 
illegally, the flow of illegals that is 
now coming into our country will turn 
into a tidal wave. We have trouble controlling 
our borders now. If we legalize 
the status of 10 million to 15 million 
illegals in our country as what is being 
advocated in this supposed comprehensive 
immigration plan, it will make the 
situation so much worse, so much more 
out of control, it will be a catastrophe 
for this country. Ten years from now, 
we will have lost our country to tens of 
millions of new people who are consuming 
all of the resources we put 
aside for our elderly, for our young 
people, for our children, for our families. 


Wake up, America. You are being betrayed. 
We are being told that our Border 
Patrol agents are going to secure 
our borders: Just pass the comprehensive 
bill, then we will secure the borders. 
Well, first of all, those are two 
unrelated issues. But then, on top of it, 
we know now that our government is 
prosecuting the Border Patrol agents 
or anyone else who gets in the way of 
the hordes of illegals that are now 
flooding into our country at this level. 
This is total insanity and is already 
doing, as I say, great harm to the people 
of our country. And no doubt, even 
though the President was there with 
our Border Patrol agents, our defenders 
in the Border Patrol and elsewhere are 
demoralized. 

And it is not just Ramos and 
Compean why our defenders are demoralized. 
What about the case of Edwards 

County, Texas? Deputy Sheriff Gilmer 
Hernandez, another American of Mexican 
descent. 

b 2210 
He too was prosecuted and imprisoned 
under the direction of Johnny 
Sutton. Anybody catch a pattern here? 
In this case, Deputy Hernandez tried 
to protect himself from a van full of 
illegals who tried to run him over after 
a routine traffic stop. He shot out the 
tires, and in the process, an illegal hiding 
behind the van’s wheel well sustained 
a minor injury. 
Once again, our government chose to 
ignore the immigration crime there of 
human trafficking. You had human 
trafficking laws that were being violated 
by those illegals who were driving 
that van and taking those people 
in. And our U.S. attorney chose to go 
after the deputy. Not only did the 
coyotes get away, the injured illegals 
have already been rewarded with 
$100,000 and green cards to match. 
Deputy Hernandez now sits in prison. 
The illegals are now living in Austin, 
Texas, $100,000 richer. This is bizarre. 
This is twilight zone stuff. 
These aren’t idiots that have designed 
this policy. These are people 
who have the wrong goals in mind, who 
are not representing the interests of 
the people of the United States, and 
are certainly not appreciative of our 
defenders. 
We’re being told that the Justice Department’s 
priority is to pursue criminals 
and human traffickers, yet we 
hear about that case that I just mentioned. 
Our defenders are afraid to defend us. 
And they’re not afraid to defend us. 
That’s not just a policy that just happened. 
It’s not just happening that 
they are afraid to defend us. This administration 
and the powers that be 
have set out to intimidate the Border 
Patrol and to make them fearful to enforce 
the law. 
At the same time we are emboldening 
those who would break our laws. So it’s 
been the policy, perhaps for a decade, 
perhaps more than a decade, but certainly 
during this entire administration, 
to intimidate those who are defending 
us at the border and embolden 
those who would cross the border illegally. 
By the way, in both of the aforementioned 
cases, our Justice Department 
determined that the illegal aliens coming 
across this country, one, a drug 
smuggler, the others coyotes smuggling 
illegals across the country, that 
their civil rights were violated. 
There’s something wrong with this 
picture when our government is protecting 
the so-called civil rights of people 
who are smuggling drugs into our 
country and carrying loads of illegal 
immigrants into our country in violation 
of our law. Something is totally 
wrong with this picture. 
If controlling the borders is a priority, 
why is this President, again, 
using border security as a wedge to 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4287 

achieve other goals? And his other 
goals, of course, amnesty to those who 
are here illegally and setting up a 
guest workers program. 

Again, whose interest is our government 
representing? 

Economist Robert Samuels pointed 
out some of the horrible impact of this 
policy that we have had that has 
brought so many illegals into our country. 
He claims that what we are doing, 
you know, some people say we are 
bringing in cheap labor, but he suggests 
we are importing poverty, and 
that that importation of poverty is 
having a dramatically negative impact 
on our country. If this country continues 
to allow uneducated, unskilled 
workers to come here illegally, it will 
bankrupt America, and we are in the 
process of bankrupting America. 

According to a report released by the 
Heritage Foundation, 50 to 60 percent 
of illegal immigrants are high school 
dropouts. 4.6 million U.S. households 
are headed up by immigrant dropouts. 
The Pew Hispanic Institute Center estimates 
that 49 percent of high school 
dropouts are illegal immigrants. 

The Heritage report estimates that 
the cost to the American taxpayer over 
the lifetime of a high school dropout is 
$1.1 million per dropout. Because of the 
government benefits they receive 
versus what they pay back into the 
system in taxes, the net cost, per year, 
for all of these illegal alien dropouts 
that are coming here, high school dropouts, 
these poverty-stricken people, 
the net cost to us per year is $397 billion, 
almost $400 billion a year. 

Put that in perspective. Of all the 
things we try to finance in this Congress 
and can’t find an extra $25 million 
for breast cancer research. 

Put it into the context with the millions 
of illegals who are working here 
in the United States off the books, who 
do not pay their share of the taxes, but 
will still reap the benefits of government 
programs, from welfare to health 
care to Social Security to public 
schools and housing. 

This is a catastrophe, a catastrophe 
not just in the making, but a catastrophe 
in reality that we are living 
right now. I see it happening in my 
own Southern California district every 
day. 

And what are those consequences? 
Let’s just note. In my area, the 
schools, the quality of education is 
going down. For the ordinary people 
who depend on public schools, their 
kids are getting shortchanged. The 
emergency rooms in hospitals are closing 
up and health care’s going down. 

Our criminal justice system is being 
inundated and, we have, I’m not sure 
the exact number. I think it’s 50 percent 
of all the felons, it might be 75 
percent of all the felons where there 
are warrants of felons that they are 
looking for are illegal immigrant felons. 


It’s breaking down our criminal justice 
system. If you get raped or murdered 
or run over by a drunk in Cali


fornia in my area, it’s likely it’s been 
done by someone who should never 
have been there legally in the first 
place. 

Our government is betraying the interest 
of our people. It’s not protecting 
our people. Yet, politically, our government 
is dominated by powerful forces 
who want these high levels of immigration, 
legal or illegal. 

This has been no mistake. People 
didn’t just close their eyes and say, oh 
my gosh; there’s 15 to 20 million people 
here illegally. No, it has been a policy 
decision made by people that we will 
support, that they will support the 
policies that have created this monstrous 
threat. 

It is not an accident. It is not something 
that just happened. The policy 
decisions were made by an elite, but 
the American people were kept in the 
dark about these decisions. 

Now, who was it? Who’s behind this 
flow into our country? 

First of all, business wants cheap 
labor. When I say that, that doesn’t 
mean that they just want cheap labor 
from people who are coming here illegally. 
That means they want the people 
who are coming here illegally to 
bid down the wages of our own people. 

So not only are the illegals working 
for less money, but now the American 
working people have to take less 
money, because their job will be given 
to an illegal. So big business wants 
cheap labor. They want the illegals to 
depress wages. That is a very powerful 
force. 

The liberal left coalition, which runs 
the Democratic party, wants more 
illegals as well. They want the political 
clout that a massive influx of low 
class and highly manipulated immigrants 
will provide their power structure. 
So you’ve got big business interests 
and business interests and the liberal 
left democratic establishment. 
Now, that is a one heck of a tough coalition. 
And it’s about as tough as it 
gets. 

And yes, the political and economic 
elites have benefited from this. Yeah. 
The democratic elites have got their 
political tools. And the businessmen 
have the people who cut their lawns, be 
nannies to their children, change the 
sheets in their hotels, do everything 
that they need to have done at a much 
lower wage, and give them the opportunity 
to give themselves huge pay 
raises. They give themselves levels of 
pay that CEOs never would have gotten 
years ago. 

You know, CEOs used to get about 10 
times as much as working people in 
their companies. Now they give themselves 
hundreds, if not thousands of 
times more than the people working in 
their company. 

But of course the people in their 
company can’t really push too hard because 
they can be replaced, many of 
them, by people from overseas. We can 
get H1B visas and flood the market 
with Pakistanis or Indians to do computer 
work. If our people won’t accept 

50 or $60,000 we can flood the market 
with H1B visas and we can make sure 
that the computer people from our 
country, you know, that they are going 
to have to accept lower wages, or we’ll 
give it to the Pakistani or the Indian. 

b 2220 
That is illegal. What about the legal 
people who come here who even work 
for less than that Pakistani or Indian 
who comes in with an H-B1 visa? 
These elites who, as I say, live behind 
closed gates and don’t have their kids 
in public schools, they are doing things 
that destroy the well-being of their fellow 
citizens. 
We see cities that are not only turning 
a blind eye to illegals, but they are 
welcoming illegals into our country. 
Recently, San Francisco Mayor Gavin 
Newsom vowed to maintain San Francisco 
as a ‘‘sanctuary city’’ for illegals, 
and he will do everything he can to 
provide sanctuary for those illegals. He 
is discouraging Federal authorities 
from conducting any immigration 
raids. Well, in whose interest is this 
mayor watching out for and the others 
who talk about these sanctuary cities? 
There are hundreds of these sanctuary 
cities across our country. The employers 
know it. Rental companies know it. 
The illegals know it. The word is going 
out all over the world. There are sanctuary 
cities. If you can make it there, 
you have got it made. And there will be 
a treasure of benefits for you as well, 
and the local government is going to 
protect you. Well, by proclaiming their 
moral superiority in protecting 
illegals, what are they doing? They are 
in reality committing a monstrous 
crime not just against the American 
people but against all those people 
overseas, perhaps 100 million people 
now waiting in line overseas to come 
here legally. They are waiting in line 
to come here legally, but yet we have 
got the mayor of San Francisco who is 
siding with the guys who cut in line in 
front of those people who are waiting 
to respect our laws and to come here to 
be Americans in the legal way. 
If the people who are here illegally 
have their status legalized and if we 
have people protecting those people 
who are here illegally, what does that 
tell the millions of people who are 
waiting overseas? It tells them they 
had better not wait. They are fools. 
This mayor of the city of San Francisco 
isn’t protecting illegals. He is actually 
accosting, actually committing 
a crime against the people who are 
waiting in line overseas. He is favoring 
those people to break the law over 
those who stand in line and wait to 
obey the law. He is siding with the 
lawbreakers rather than siding with 
those immigrants from overseas who 
would like to come here and follow our 
laws. He is not just protecting the unfortunate 
people of the world. He is siding 
with that group of people over 
those unfortunate people who would 
obey our laws and come here. 
The prosecution of Ramos and 
Compean has not gone unnoticed, as 


H4288 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE May 1, 2007 

well as the sanctuary cities I am talking 
about, the actions of the mayor of 
San Francisco. Yes, couple that with 
the prosecution of Ramos and 
Compean, and what we have got is 
there are good people all over the world 
as well as some bad people, but good 
people even who are saying that they 
can come here now. Let’s get to the 
United States because the United 
States doesn’t have the will to stop us. 
These are good people, but they will 
consume our resources that we should 
have for our own people, and they will 
depress the wages of the American 
worker, and they will bring diseases 
right into our schools that we have a 
long time ago conquered. And the 
breakdown of our borders will have 
been lost not only just to the good people 
who will flood across and be out of 
control but to drug dealers who have 
noticed Ramos and Compean and the 
Border Patrol agents and also to terrorists. 
You can bet that the terrorists 
around the world have noticed the 
chaos on our southern border. 

Mr. Speaker, in the coming weeks, 
Congress will begin debate on the 
Flake-Gutierrez bill. This flawed bill 
almost guarantees a legalization of the 
status from 12 to 15 million illegal immigrants 
already in the United States. 
The bill requires illegals to pay fines 
and sit through English classes in 
order to claim that it doesn’t qualify 
as an amnesty. However, the 1986 Immigration 
Reform Act required the 
exact same thing: a waiting period, 
fines, mandatory English classes. And 
no one can deny that that was an amnesty 
bill. 

The bottom line is the Flake-Gutierrez 
bill, if it passes, you can skip the 
line, skip it totally, all those people 
waiting in line overseas, and buy your 
citizenship for a whopping $2,500. Under 
this legislation right now, illegals who 
seek amnesty do not have to pay back 
taxes nor do they have to wait the current 
10-year period before re-entry into 
this country after they have been 
caught here illegally. Flake-Gutierrez 
will permit the newly minted residents, 
legal residents now because they have 
now been made legal residents, to 
apply for billions of dollars in public 
assistance. The Heritage Foundation 
estimates the fiscal cost to the taxpayers 
of such an amnesty will be $30 
billion a year. Newly legitimized residents, 
legalized residents, will also receive 
Social Security benefits based on 
their work while they have been here 
illegally. Since most illegal immigrants 
worked under fake Social Security 
numbers or stolen ones, it will create 
unknown costs to the Social Security 
Administration. 

And, of course, President Bush has 
already made a secret agreement with 
Mexico that we had to dig out of the 
administration with Freedom of Information 
requests. That secret agreement 
was that any new legalization of 
status will include giving those illegal 
Mexicans who worked in the United 
States Social Security benefits for 

their time when they have worked in 
the United States, but that has been 
kept hush hush. 

By the way, Social Security isn’t just 
a retirement plan. It is also a survivors’ 
benefit. And you can imagine 
how many morticians from around the 
world are going to be sending their letter 
into Social Security, saying somebody 
worked in your country illegally 
for this year. He died and please start 
sending your thousand dollar checks to 
his children at this address. This is a 
catastrophe not only in the making. 
This is a catastrophe that is already 
before us. This bill could pass and destroy 
our Social Security system. 

Perhaps the worst element in this is 
that, contrary to claims otherwise, the 
bill does not send illegals back to the 
back of the line. Currently, there are 
over 3 million aliens who have already 
been approved for green cards but are 
still waiting overseas, waiting for 
sometimes up to 23 years, to come here 
legally. Under this bill millions of 
illegals who claim to have been here illegally 
since 2006 can keep working legally 
now in the U.S. and will be eligible 
for permanent residence. So they 
will be here legally, and then they can 
apply for permanent residence in 8 
years. People who have played by the 
rules will still have to wait for their 
green cards oversees. So why should 
they wait in line at all? 

As I say, this is going to give us tens 
of millions of new illegals pouring into 
our country, destroying our social infrastructure, 
our schools, our hospitals, 
our retirement systems. The 
last amnesty in 1986 resulted in 15 to 20 
million new illegals pouring into our 
country. This amnesty will give us 50 
million or more. The Heritage Foundation 
estimates that 100 million new 
people will be here after 10 years as a 
result of this immigration reform. 
Wake up, America. We are losing our 
country. We are being betrayed. Who is 
representing the interest of the American 
people? 

The President has often mentioned 
the reason most illegals come here is 
to do work that most Americans won’t 
do. However, Flake-Gutierrez specifically 
allows employers to lay off Americans 
and replace them with new foreign 
workers as long as those Americans 
were laid off 90 days before they 
decided to bring the new people in. Employers 
are also absolved of any form of 
civil or criminal liability related to the 
prior employment of illegals. And as 
long as the incentive to work and benefits 
exist, illegals will flood into our 
country. 

I have been a consistent advocate for 
tough employer sanctions. Yet Flake-
Gutierrez prohibits State and local 
governments from punishing employers 
who have hired illegal immigrants or 
from requiring them to use an employment 
verification system or from requiring 
that that system be used to 
verify the legal status of renters or 
public benefits applicants or people 
who are undergoing background 
checks. 

b 2230 

It dramatically reduces the civil penalties 
for employers who knowingly 
hire or continue to employ illegals, or 
who fail to comply with the employment 
verification system already approved 
by the last Congress. As a matter 
of fact, section 301 of the bill, employers 
can avoid using the verification 
system altogether simply by saying 
they are hiring private contractors. 

This legislation is tantamount to the 
surrender of America’s ability to control 
our territory from any foreigner 
who wants to come here. It is an immigration 
catastrophe, a nightmare for 
America’s most vulnerable, our vulnerable 
middle class, a nightmare. Frighteningly, 
President Bush is supportive, 
as are many corporate-minded Republicans, 
and almost every Democrat 
that I know, although there are a few, 
hopefully, coming over to our side who 
understand how this is hurting their 
constituents. As I say, a handful of 
Democrats have signed on to the bill to 
pardon Ramos and Compean. 

But by and large, the Republican 
leadership, the President, the Democratic 
leadership, the Democratic 
Party and most Members of Congress 
are in favor of this type of ‘‘comprehensive 
bill’’ and have not been 
helpful in saving Ramos and Compean. 

Who is watching out for the American 
people? Well, it is up to us, the 
United States. And what we can do is 
make sure that everyone talks to their 
representative and talks to their Senator, 
and does so aggressively, not in a 
low voice, but in an aggressive voice 
because you’re protecting your families 
and your children and you’re protecting 
your country in the future. 

We are up against a powerful political 
coalition. They are using examples 
saying, oh, we need these illegal aliens 
to work; there are jobs Americans 
won’t take. There are jobs that Americans 
won’t take at the pay level that 
these big businessmen want to give 
them. And don’t tell me that if we paid 
janitors more money, that we can’t 
find people to be janitors. I was a janitor 
years ago. You go back, and janitors 
are making the same amount of 
money as I made when I was a janitor 
40 years ago, yet the income of our 
country, the GNP, has quadrupled. 
They have been left out because a 
horde of illegals have come into this 
country and bid down their wages. 

Now, why is it that people who are 
janitors or people who work with their 
hands, people who work in regular mid-
dle-class jobs shouldn’t be able to enjoy 
the fruits of our country, that their 
wages should be depressed, they should 
be frozen out of having a better living 
for their family? Then they say, well, 
there are jobs they won’t even do, like 
picking fruits and vegetables. We’ve 
got more people between the ages of 18 
and 40, young, healthy men housed in 
prisons in the middle of our agricultural 
areas who could profit by working. 
They could earn enough money to 
pay for their own incarceration and 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4289 

pay for a little restitution. But those 
ideas are too creative. No, no, no. Instead, 
let’s just bring the illegals 
across, that will keep everybody’s 
wages down and we can control them 
and they will be off the chart. 

Well, let me suggest this; we’ve been 
given a false dichotomy saying that we 
have to offer a legalization status, an 
amnesty, or we have to have massive 
deportations. It’s either legalization or 
deportation. That is the most serious 
of all of the lies that are being told 
today about immigration because that 
is not true. We do have an alternative; 
there is an alternative to just deporting. 
We don’t want to have sweeps of 
law enforcement through foreign 
neighborhoods, but we can just make 
sure that we have ID cards, we have 
Social Security cards, that we have ID 
cards that can’t be tampered with so 
we can prove who we are dealing with. 
We can have a verification system so 
that employers will know who they’re 
employing and we can hold those employers 
accountable. And we can also 
make sure that illegals who don’t have 
the benefits cards, these identities that 
show they are eligible, cannot get the 
health care, the education, the housing, 
the Social Security and retirement 
benefits that are due to American citizens 
and people who are here legally. 

If we do not give the jobs and the 
benefits to people who are here illegally, 
they will go home. Just as soon 
as you give it to them, they will come. 
If you don’t give it to them and they 
find trouble earning a living, supporting 
their families, they will go 
home. It’s called attrition. That is the 
decision we have to make. Creating a 
false dichotomy, saying it’s either 
going to be legalization or deportation, 
that’s the type of word game that is 
unfair in this debate. It’s just like calling 
amnesty something that it isn’t, 
saying that this is not an amnesty 
when it clearly is. 

We must be able to say no to people 
who are using the scarce resources that 
are meant for our people. These resources 
belong to the American people, 
whether it is our education establishment, 
our health care, job training, 
housing, retirement benefits, these are 
things that belong to the American 
people. We must protect the interests 
of our people and say no to people who 
would consume those things that are 
meant for our own people. 

This is not mean-spirited selfishness. 
And probably that is the greatest debate 
of all, because people are playing 
on it as if we’re trying to push us into 
letting more and more illegals come in 
here and destroying our system, like 
just to say, if you try to stop it, you’re 
being mean-spirited and nasty. Americans 
don’t like that. Americans don’t 
like it at all, of course they don’t. We 
are as generous as any people in the 
world. But it is not selfish to take care 
of your own family. It is not selfish to 
take care of your own community. It is 
not selfish to take care of your own 
country before you expend the re


sources and take care of people elsewhere 
in the world. It is not selfish, it 
is being responsible. 

And we, as representatives of the 
people of the United States, owe it to 
the people of the United States to be 
watching out for them, watching out 
for their interests. If we don’t do it, no 
one is going to watch out for the interests 
of our people. I am afraid that tonight 
it’s up to us, the people. Either 
we will speak out; we will rise with a 
righteous rage and oppose this immigration 
travesty that is about to be 
foisted upon us or we will suffer grave 
consequences. Within 10 years, our 
country will have been lost. Ten, 20, 30, 
40, 100 million new people here, some of 
them terrorists, some of them criminals, 
most of them good people, but 
still, people who don’t deserve to be 
consuming those resources that we 
have built and saved and created for 
our own people. 

So with that, I close and ask the 
American people to wake up and pay 
attention.

PERFORMANCE OF THE MEDIA 
Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, my 
theme today has to do with our friends 
in the media, or the fourth estate as 
they like to call themselves. There are 
two items I wish to call to the attention 
of the Senate and anyone else who 
might be listening with respect to the 
performance of the media. The first one 
is highlighted in an editorial that appeared 
this morning in the Wall Street 
Journal entitled ‘‘Frist’s Vindication.’’ 
All of us in this Chamber know Senator 
FRIST. We know him as a man of 
integrity, intelligence, and grace. He 
presided over the Senate as the majority 
leader for 4 years. He has a long 
history as a humanitarian, as a scientist, 
as a skilled doctor who pioneered 
procedures in the process of 
heart and lung transplants. 
We also know him as the target of 
media attack for insider trading, and 
we know groups that are self-anointed 
as watchdogs of the public consciousness 
that picked that up and kept the 
drumbeat alive. Our friends in the 
media also kept the drumbeat alive 
saying, over and over again, Dr. Frist 
was a hypocrite, Dr. Frist engaged in 
insider trading, Dr. Frist used his position 
to enrich himself while he was 
here in the Senate. 
Well, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission was sufficiently aroused 
by those attacks that they entered into 
an investigation of Dr. Frist’s activities 
with respect to his stock. That investigation 
is now closed. I did not realize 
the investigation was closed because 
there has been no hue and cry 
whatsoever in the media. There has 
been no mention that came to my attention 
in the media, until I picked up 
this morning’s Wall Street Journal and 
saw this editorial. 
I would like to quote from it. Under 
the title ‘‘Frist’s Vindication’’ and the 
subhead ‘‘So much for that ‘insider 
trading’ smear,’’ here is what it says: 
When insider-trading allegations against 
former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist 

S This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

S5316 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

surfaced back in 2005, they were splashed on 
the pages of major newspapers from coast to 
coast. Now that Dr. Frist has been vindicated, 
the silence is instructive. Is anybody 
out there? 

It goes on to describe the allegations 
against Dr. Frist. I shall not repeat 
them. Basically, it says he used his position 
in the Senate to get insider information 
and started selling his stock 
in HCA in advance of a drop in the 
stock that occurred because of earnings 
reports. 

The editorial says: 

Thanks in part to his meticulous email archives, 
Dr. Frist was able to show that he 
had begun the process of selling his HCA 
stock in April of 2005, months before he was 
alleged to have received the inside whispers. 

It goes on to discuss the groups that 
attacked him. Again quoting: 

For years he was harassed by such liberal 
lobbies as Public Citizen, and Citizens for 
Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, 
which alleged conflicts of interest. These 
groups objected even to those stocks he held 
in the blind trust he had created to avoid the 
appearance of a conflict of interest. Yet 
when he sold those stocks, with a possible 
eye on higher office, he was pilloried for 
doing what the ethicists had asked him to do 
all along. 

The editorial indicates that while 
this absolution is a relief to Dr. Frist, 
‘‘it’s impossible to undo the damage to 
his political career. Despite flimsy evidence, 
the media storm cast a shadow 
over his office, derailing any thought 
of a Presidential bid this year. The 
Nashville heart surgeon chose instead 
to ‘take a sabbatical from public life.’’’ 

A great deal was made out of this. 
The editorial quotes American University 
professor James Thurber as saying 
that Dr. Frist ‘‘came in like Jimmy 
Stewart and was leaving like Martha 
Stewart.’’ That is a great line. That 
gets headlines. The press loves things 
of that kind. 

Now that it is clear he behaved in an 
absolutely ethical way—documented 
everything he did, turned over all of 
his e-mails—and has been completely 
cleared, after 18 months of careful examination 
by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, we hear nothing 
in the press, we hear nothing in the 
way of an apology from Public Citizen 
or Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics 
in Washington. Maybe ethics does 
not apply to them when it comes to 
apologizing for smears against legitimate 
and responsible public servants. 
Maybe we will now hear that Dr. Thurber 
has something else to say besides 
his quick quip about Dr. Frist being 
the same as Martha Stewart as she 
went to jail. But I doubt we will hear 
any of that. I doubt the press will even 
notice. I doubt there will be a sidebar 
anywhere. 

I am grateful to the Wall Street 
Journal for pointing this out to us, and 
I appreciate the opportunity on the 
floor of the Senate to speak on behalf 
of a man whom I consider a friend, I 
think whom all of us consider a responsible 
Senator, a devoted leader. He deserves 
better at the hands of the press 

and those self-appointed leaders of ethics 
who are quick to criticize but slow 
to apologize. 

Now, Mr. President, the next issue I 
would like to raise with respect to the 
media has to do with the hysteria over 
America’s trade deficit with China. I 
have some charts I would like to put up 
to show some historical evidence with 
respect to this issue. 

Let’s talk about China and the trade 
deficit and the rise of China. This chart 
has two lines on it, one in red, which is 
American exports to China, and one in 
blue, which is American imports from 
China. 

Let’s go back to 1975, before people 
were all excited about China and how 
China was destroying us in the age of 
globalization, how China’s cheap labor 
was taking all of our jobs, and we were 
flooded with Chinese imports. We notice 
on the chart there was a gap between 
American exports to China and 
American imports from China. No one 
felt that gap was ready to threaten and 
destroy the American economy. No one 
got excited about it. All right. 

You go to 1990, and you find that neither 
line has moved up very much, but 
the gap remains virtually the same. 
Now, the Chinese economy started to 
take off and we started to buy things 
from them, and at the same time we 
started to sell things to them. Both 
lines started moving up. We saw, yes, 
imports from China were going up, but 
exports to China were going up. By 
2002, 2003, both were up significantly 
over where they had been in 1975. But 
the gap remained roughly the same. All 
right. 

Interestingly enough, as we get toward 
2005 and so on, there are moments 
when the gap disappears, when our 
sales to China were greater than our 
imports from China. Why would that 
be? It would be because the improving 
Chinese economy now has enough 
money to buy American goods. They 
want to buy our airplanes. Boeing does 
well in China. The last time I was in 
China, I met with the manager of General 
Motors in China. General Motors 
was having a very bad year in the 
United States, but they were having a 
good year in China. They were making 
money in China. They were selling 
Buicks and other automobiles in China. 

The red line started to move up, and, 
as I say, at one point they actually 
crossed the blue line. OK, the blue line 
opened up again, not as great as the 
gap back in 1975, but it began to open 
up. Once again, we saw the gap closed. 
Sales to China reached the same level 
as purchases from China. And then it 
opened up again. It appears if we want 
to project from this period on into the 
future that the pattern of our importing 
slightly more from China than we 
sell to China is likely to continue. 

I doubt this historic demonstration 
of facts comports with the way the 
media is talking about China. They are 
telling us China is going to overtake 
us. They are telling us China is going 
to destroy us. They are telling us 

China is the nation of the future. We 
have heard in the media statements 
about the 20th century being the American 
century; the 21st century is going 
to be the Chinese century. 

Well, let me put up another chart 
that I think will demonstrate that 
might be a little bit premature. 

Let’s look at the size of the two 
economies. The size of the economy is 
measured in gross domestic product. 
The gross domestic product of the 
United States in 2000 was $9.8 trillion. 
The gross domestic product in China in 
2000 was $1.2 trillion. This is the beginning 
of the Chinese century? The Chinese 
are starting off pretty far behind 
in this race if they are going to turn 
the 21st century into the Chinese century. 
They are at $1.2 trillion and we 
are at $9.8 trillion. We have sprinted 
into what the media is calling the Chinese 
century now for the first 6 years. 

Where are we? These statistics are 
for the first 5 years, the first 5 percent. 
In that period of time, our annual GDP 
growth has been 3.2 percent. The Chinese 
has been 10 percent. Those are the 
numbers that say they are going to 
overtake us. Ten percent is clearly better 
than 3 percent. 

I would make this one footnote with 
respect to the 10 percent. I am a little 
suspect of these numbers because the 
Chinese released their annual figures 
on December 31 of the same year. We 
don’t know our annual figures for 
months afterwards. Then, when more 
data comes in, we revise them upward 
or downward, based on additional information. 
Somehow they know on New 
Year’s Eve exactly how they have done 
during the year. If they were a corporation 
required to report to the SEC, 
there would be some investigations 
about the possibility of ‘‘cooking the 
books.’’ I think they make the determination 
of where they want the number 
to be and then report it thusly, either 
too high or too low for whatever 
their political purposes might be. 

So all right, let’s take these numbers 
at their face value. These numbers 
mean from 2000 to 2005 the Chinese 
GDP grew from $1.2 trillion to $2.2 trillion, 
a $1 trillion increase. That is not 
a slouchy thing to do. That is clearly a 
tremendously impressive perform-
ance—almost doubling a $1 trillion increase. 
How about the United States. 
We are just limping along at 3 percent, 

3.2 percent, but we went from $9.8 trillion 
to $12.4 trillion. 
In other words, they went up $1 trillion, 
and we went up $3 trillion. How is 
that possible if they are growing another 
10 percent, and we are only growing 
at 3 percent? It is because they are 
starting from a very low base. Those 
who say the 21st century will be the 
Chinese century and the Americans are 
through need to pay attention to what 
the real numbers are. 

If we are going to have a game and 
we start out the game with one team 
having almost 10 times as many points 
as the other, and then add on to that 
on a percentage basis rather than an 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5317 

absolute basis, we see in terms of the 
gap between the size of the American 
GDP and the Chinese GDP the gap is 
actually widening rather than shrinking. 
Yes, they can have a higher rate of 
growth, but their higher rate of growth 
is on a much lower base. Our growth on 
a higher base is unprecedented in world 
history. 

My message today is we need to hold 
the media accountable as well as all of 
the others. We have had two examples 
I have highlighted this morning where 
the media has misled us: the first with 
respect to one of our respected and beloved 
colleagues, Dr. Frist, where he 
was smeared and then when he was vindicated, 
that fact was ignored. The second 
has to do with telling us where the 
world is going. For whatever reasons, 
there are those who are constantly 
panicked about China and its impact 
on the United States who need to pay 
attention to the reality of the numbers.

IRAQ 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today is 
an important yet a sad day for our Nation 
because it represents the 85th day 
that our fighting men and women in 
uniform have been waiting for emergency 
aid from the Congress. Yet they 
have been left waiting because of political 
gamesmanship and political theater 
in Washington, DC. The latest is 
reported in the Congressional Quarterly 
today, an article I have here in 
my hand—actually the date is April 30, 
2007, 10:45 p.m., entitled: ‘‘President’s 
Veto Dependent on House Speaker’s 
Signature.’’ The report is that Congresswoman 
PELOSI wanted time to 
personally read the emergency supplemental 
bill and to sign it before sending 
it to Pennsylvania Avenue. I would 
have thought that Congresswoman 
PELOSI and Members of Congress would 
have read legislation before they voted 
on it, not afterwards. 
Also, in today’s edition of The Hill, 
there is a story that says: 
Congressional leaders today will put an exclamation 
point on their political showdown 
with President Bush on Iraq spending, staging 
a signing event to send their Iraq supplemental 
bill to the White House. 
I don’t think this is Congress’s finest 
hour, and I think it is an embarrassment 
that when our troops are waiting 
on an emergency spending bill to provide 
them essential equipment, we are 
staging signing ceremonies and going 
through political kabuki theater just 
to demonstrate on the part of some 
their disagreement on the present 
strategy in Baghdad and in Iraq. I 
think it is inappropriate and irresponsible. 
I know one of our colleagues here has 
talked about, for example, the MRAP 
vehicles, the so-called Mine Resistant 
Ambush Prevented V-shaped hull vehi


cles that are awaiting $3.1 billion in 
spending in this appropriations bill to 
get those to the Marines and Army in 
Iraq, something that has proven, in the 
hands of the Marines, to be very resistant 
to the improvised explosive devices. 
They save lives. That is one example, 
one concrete example of funding 
for equipment that is being held up because 
Congress continues to dither and 
play political games now 85 days after 
the President has requested this funding 
for our troops. The bill that will— 
after this so-called signing ceremony 
and after this reading of the bill after 
it has passed rather than before it was 
passed exercise—be sent to the President 
and he will veto it is simply unacceptable. 
Why? For two reasons. 

First of all, because it imposes arbitrary 
timelines on our generals in Iraq, 
including GEN David Petraeus, who 
was confirmed unanimously by the 
Senate, who was here last week to explain 
the progress that is being made 
in places such as Al Anbar Province, 
west of Iraq, which has been controlled 
by al-Qaida for some time now, and we 
are finally starting to see some real, 
concrete improvements being made 
there. We are seeing the local sheiks 
offering troops to supplement Iraqi police 
officers and the Iraqi Army to 
fight al-Qaida—the same organization 
that killed 3,000 Americans on September 
11—right in Iraq. That is good 
news. 

We are beginning to see some real security 
measures going forward. So why 
we would have Congress tie the hands 
of General Petraeus and these successful 
efforts in Al Anbar Province, west 
of Baghdad, controlled by al-Qaida, and 
why Congress would want to tie the 
hands of our military leaders at a time 
when we are seeing some real improvement 
there is, frankly, beyond me. 
Why would we simply give up when we 
are beginning to see some light at the 
end of the tunnel? 

Then, of course, there is the second 
matter of providing porkbarrel spending 
in order to secure the votes of some 
Members of the House for this bill that 
they would not support on the merits. 
It is completely demeaning to our 
troops and the nobility of their sacrifice, 
not to mention the sacrifice of 
the military families who wait anxiously 
hoping their loved one will return 
from the fight only to be told that 
Congress is causing unnecessary delays 
in this spending—85 days now—putting 
arbitrary timelines on the troops, making 
it harder for them to succeed, denying 
them the equipment necessary for 
their very safety, while Congress engages 
in more porkbarrel spending in 
order to secure a political consensus 
for this ill-considered piece of legislation. 


The bill, on its way to the President 
after this kabuki theater, substitutes 
congressional mandates for the considered 
judgments of our military leaders. 
This bill assumes and forces the failure 
of a new strategy, which is only halfway 
implemented. The new Baghdad 

security plan to back up Iraqi forces in 
Baghdad to implement the clear hold-
and-build strategy that GEN David 
Petraeus is the architect of as part of 
our counterinsurgency measures is 
only halfway deployed. Only half of the 
troops that are a part of this so-called 
surge are on the ground. While we are 
seeing some progress, we are also seeing 
some increased violence and, unfortunately, 
deaths as a result of meeting 
the enemy in places where previously 
they were safe and secure because we 
could not even go into places such as 
Sadar City, which was controlled by 
Moqtada al-Sadr, the radical Shiite 
cleric who has since left to go to 
Tehran. He has left the country because 
he is afraid of the American and 
Iraqi military forces joining together. 
He has instructed the Shiite militias, 
one of the major causes of death squads 
and violence and ethnic cleansing in 
Iraq, to lay down their arms. What is 
there not to like about that kind of 
progress? Yet Congress, thousands of 
miles away in the safety and comfort 
of the Senate Chamber and our offices, 
is undermining the good efforts that 
are going forward in Iraq. 

While no one believes success is assured, 
we know, in the words of General 
Petraeus: 

The mission is hard, but it is not hopeless. 

The only thing that would make it 
hopeless is if Congress continues to undermine 
General Petraeus and our 
troops who are in harm’s way. It boggles 
my mind that we have that sort of 
mindset in Washington, DC because of 
some rabid, antiwar, left-leaning 
groups that insist we ought to simply 
tuck our tail and run. They haven’t 
come up with an adequate explanation 
as to what they think would happen if 
we were to leave precipitously, as some 
of them suggest. 

I happen to believe that notwithstanding 
the fact that Darfur, where 
400,000 people at last count have died as 
a result of terrible violence there, 
would pale compared to the ethnic 
cleansing and the violence that would 
follow if America were to betray our 
Iraqi allies and would leave precipitously. 
It would also create a regional 
conflict where Sunni majority nations 
would come in and try to stave off the 
Shiites from Iran for helping them and 
trying to prevent them from killing 
the Sunni minority there. 

The Democratic leadership has not 
helped the situation in Iraq with their 
recent pronouncements either. Democratic 
leadership in recent floor statements 
has suggested that if the President 
vetoes this bill, then he will be 
the one endangering the troops. They 
further stated they hope the President 
would realize that with his pen in hand 
he can honor soldiers, honor his country, 
and bring an end to this war. 

To that I say baloney. That is sheer 
fantasy that by cutting and running, 
by neglecting our allies in Iraq, by neglecting 
the improvements we have 
been able to make, by recruiting tribal 
sheiks to help us in fighting al-Qaida, 


S5318 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

that somehow, by giving up on that, we 
are going to bring an end to the violence 
and the death in Iraq. To the contrary, 
we would create a failed state 
where al-Qaida, the very same people 
who hit this country on September 11, 
2001, could reorganize, train, and recruit, 
and export future terrorist attacks 
to the United States. 

I am chilled by comments made a few 
months ago when I attended a ceremony 
where the Deputy Secretary of 
Defense spoke. 

He asked rhetorically: 

Do you know why al-Qaida killed 3,000 people 
on September 11, 2001, in New York and 
Washington, DC? 

Then he answered his own question. 
He said: 

Because they could not kill 30,000, because 
they could not kill 3 million. 

His point is if they had the kind of 
biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons 
they are seeking, they would have 
killed thousands—perhaps hundreds of 
thousands more innocent Americans. 
And they will do that at will if they 
are provided that sort of weaponry. 

So it is sheer naivete on the part of 
those who say all we need to do is leave 
and somehow these people will go 
away. They will not go away and they 
will visit us here again with deadly results. 


With General Petraeus back from 
Iraq for the first time last week since 
he assumed command of U.S. forces, 
and the emergency supplemental, I 
hope, reaching the President later 
today, it is appropriate to reflect on 
the majority leader’s statement, where 
he said we have ‘‘lost the war.’’ 

Two weeks ago, the Senate Armed 
Services Committee heard testimony 
from GEN Barry McCaffrey, a proven 
combat commander from the first gulf 
war, and a recognized expert on the 
tactical, operational, and strategic situation 
in Iraq. I will quote for a moment 
from his statement. He said: 

The consequences of failure in Iraq will be 
a disaster to the American people and our allies 
if we cannot achieve our objective to 
create a stable, law-based state at peace with 
its neighbors. . . . We have 150,000 U.S. 
troops battling in Iraq and 22,000 fighting 
bravely in Afghanistan. 

These are the finest, most courageous military 
men and women we have ever fielded in 
battle. Their commanders—who have almost 
without exception at company, battalion, 
and brigade level served multiple combat 
tours—are the most capable leaders that I 
have encountered in my many years of 
watching our Armed Forces with admiration. 

He goes on to say: 

Our new leadership team in Iraq—our brilliant 
new commander, General David 
Petraeus, and the equally experienced Ambassador 
Ryan Crocker—are launched on a 
new approach to use political reconciliation, 
new methods and equipment to strengthen 
the Iraqi security forces and enhanced U.S. 
combat protective power to stabilize the situation. 
We must give them time and space. 

That is exactly what we are trying to 
do, to provide the basic security General 
Petraeus said is necessary, but not 
sufficient, to solve the problem. 

I submit our colleagues who have 
said General Petraeus said there is no 
military solution in Iraq are not listening 
to what he is saying, because what 
he has said is that improving our security 
situation is necessary but not sufficient. 
It is not a question of whether 
we are going to do the security part or 
the political reconciliation part. One 
must precede the other. It makes common 
sense that it is hard to sit down 
and work out your differences around a 
conference table in a political debate, 
or an attempt at reconciliation, if people 
are driving automobile-borne improvised 
explosive devices or people are 
walking into the Parliament in a suicide 
vest. So security must precede the 
political reconciliation that we all recognize 
is so absolutely important. That 
is what General Petraeus is saying. 
That is what we have to accomplish. 

We have some hopeful signs in Iraq 
now, for the first time in a long time, 
as a result of this new strategy that is 
only about half way implemented. But 
if we are going to succeed, it won’t be 
because our commanders have had 
their hands tied by arbitrary deadlines 
in Washington, DC. It won’t be because 
of the political theater going on here 85 
days after the President had requested 
the emergency spending included in 
this bill for necessary equipment for 
our troops. 

The leadership should sign this legislation 
and get it to the President so he 
can veto it and we can get down to the 
serious business of providing for our 
troops. 

I yield the floor. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The minority’s time has expired. 

The Senator from New Jersey is recognized. 


f 

IRAQ 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, 4 
years ago today, President Bush landed 
on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln in his 
flight suit. The banner behind him 
proudly said, ‘‘Mission accomplished.’’ 
President Bush announced to the 
world, and to the American people, 
that ‘‘major combat operations in Iraq 
have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the 
United States and our allies have prevailed.’’ 
I can think of almost no greater act 
of hubris, arrogance, and denial than 
the declaration of mission accomplished 
in Iraq 4 years ago. It is truly 
stunning how false that statement was. 
Four years ago today, President Bush 
declared mission accomplished. Yet, 
since that time, 3,000 U.S. troops have 
been killed in Iraq. Over 104 American 
troops died in April alone, making it 
the deadliest month since last December. 
Four years ago today, President Bush 
declared mission accomplished. Yet we 
have now spent over $450 billion on the 
war in Iraq. This war is costing us almost 
10 times what the Bush administration 
initially said it would. 
Four years ago today, President Bush 
declared mission accomplished. Yet we 

have now been in Iraq for nearly 50 
months, longer than the United States 
was in World War II. 

Four years ago today, President Bush 
declared mission accomplished. Yet 

U.S. troop fatalities are up 33 percent 
since the President’s escalation of the 
war in January. 
Four years ago today, President Bush 
declared mission accomplished. Yet 
today, Iraqi civilian casualties are estimated 
to be in the tens or even hundreds 
of thousands. It is impossible to 
know how many have been killed in 
Iraq, but the United Nations estimates 
that 35,000 civilians have been killed. 

Four years ago today, President Bush 
declared mission accomplished. Yet 
today oil production in Iraq is still 15 
percent lower than it was before the 
war. 

Four years ago today, President Bush 
declared mission accomplished. Yet 
Baghdad is only getting 6 hours of electricity 
a day, significantly less than 
before the war. 

Four years ago today, President Bush 
declared mission accomplished. Yet the 
Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction 
just put out a new report 
detailing how projects the administration 
declared a ‘‘success’’ are actually 
failing and no longer operating. 

Frankly, it reminds me of all the 
other ways we were misled by this administration. 
Let us remember what 
this administration told us about this 
war. Let us remember the Iraq myths. 
Remember the unfound weapons of 
mass destruction; remember the missing 
mobile weapons labs; remember the 
yellowcake uranium in Africa; remember 
Saddam’s nonexistent vast stockpiles 
of chemical weapons; remember 
when Secretary Rumsfeld told us that 
‘‘we know where the weapons of mass 
destruction are;’’ remember the nonexistent 
link between al-Qaida and 
Saddam; remember the claims that 
Iraqi oil and other countries, not the 
United States taxpayer, would pay for 
the cost of reconstruction; remember 
when the administration told us the 
war would cost only between $50 billion 
and $60 billion; remember when Paul 
Wolfowitz said ‘‘it seems outlandish’’ 
to think we would need several hundred 
thousand troops in Iraq; and remember 
when President Bush told us 
on May 1, 2003, that ‘‘major combat operations 
in Iraq have ended.’’ 

This is the same administration that 
now comes to this Congress and says: 
Trust us. This is the same administration 
that says: Trust us, our new escalation 
plan will work. This is the same 
administration that tells this Congress 
and the American people to be patient, 
to give their ‘‘new’’ plan to escalate 
the war time to work. 

Yet their new plan is more of the 
same. To quote one of the witnesses 
who testified before the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee: 

This plan is just stay-the-course plus 20,000 
troops. 
That is what they thought then when 
the witness testified, but eventually it 
has been a lot more than 20,000 troops. 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5319 

Well, the American people and this 
Congress have run out of patience. This 
administration has run out of credibility 
to ask for more time or another 
chance, when all we are largely doing 
is staying the course. Frankly, I find it 
insulting that this administration 
thinks this Congress would simply go 
along with their escalation plan without 
question. 

Why should we support President 
Bush’s escalation—a plan with benchmarks 
but no real consequences? As I 
have said time and time again, benchmarks 
without consequences are simply 
aspirations. We have seen countless 
misguided plans from this administration, 
but the Iraqis have never been 
held accountable. 

We were told by the end of 2006 a provincial 
election law would be approved. 
But that benchmark has not been met. 
We were told that Iraqis would approve 
a law for de-Baathification. But that 
benchmark has not been met. 

We were told that Iraqis would create 
a law to help restrain sectarian militias. 
But that benchmark, too, has not 
been met. 

We were told the Iraqis would establish 
a law to regulate the oil industry 
and share revenues, which is one of the 
critical elements to be able to achieve 
reconciliation in Iraq, the sharing of 
the nation’s national resources. But 
that benchmark has not been met. 

We were told that, by March, the 
Iraqi Government was supposed to hold 
a referendum on constitutional amendments. 
But that benchmark has not 
been met. 

Time and again, the Iraqi Government 
has fallen short; and time and 
again, this administration has looked 
the other way—basing their plans on 
the hope that the Iraqis will step up. 
Continuing this failed policy in Iraq 
based on the mere hope that things will 
improve is not good enough. The broken 
promises must stop. 

It also seems to me the President is 
once again out of touch about our 
progress on the ground and his escalation 
plan. The President said last 
week: 

The direction of the fight is beginning to 
shift . . . and so far the operation is meeting 
expectations. 

This is very much like ‘‘mission accomplished.’’ 
Yet, last Monday, an attack 
carried out by a suicide bomber 
near Baqubah killed 9 soldiers and 
wounded 20 others. The explosion was 
one of the deadliest single ground attacks 
on American forces since the 
start of the war. 

Two weeks ago, five different bombs 
exploded in Baghdad, killing at least 
171 people. These attacks mark the 
deadliest day in the capital city since 
the new security plan was implemented 
2 months ago. 

In fact, almost four coalition soldiers 
have been killed per day in the past 
month—the highest rate since January 
of 2005. As I pointed out before, over 100 
soldiers were killed in April, including 
9 killed over the weekend, 1 of only 6 

times that more than 100 servicemembers 
were killed in 1 month since the 
start of the war. 

Violence outside of Baghdad is on the 
rise, with more than twice the number 
of American troops killed in the past 5 
months in Diyala Province than were 
killed all of last year. 

In terms of civilians, over 1,500 Iraqis 
were killed between February 14 and 
April 12. That is almost 500 more people 
than were killed during the previous 
2 months. 

Frankly, I don’t believe the President’s 
escalation plan is working. So I 
say to the President: The era of blank 
checks is over and the time of congressional 
oversight has begun. 

The President would largely want us 
to send him a blank check. We have 
spent 10 times more than we were told 
we would spend on this war, and there 
is no end in sight in terms of lives and 
national treasure. That is why this 
Senate and the House sent the President 
an Iraq spending bill with a responsible 
timeline for withdrawing our 
troops from Iraq. I believe the President 
is making a serious mistake with 
his plan to veto the bill. 

Some on the other side of the aisle 
like to point out that the President is 
the Commander in Chief. I remind my 
friends the Constitution puts the Congress 
in charge of appropriating funds. 
The Constitution, in article I, section 
8, provides what scholars call the 
power of the purse, and it says: ‘‘The 
Congress’’—the Congress—‘‘shall have 
Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, 
Imposts and Excises, to pay the 
Debts and provide for the common 
Defence and general Welfare of the 
United States.’’ Congress has the power 
and the right and the obligation to 
make sure we spend the taxpayers’ 
money wisely. 

In a recent editorial, Leon Panetta, a 
member of the Iraq Study Group, reminded 
us the President has stated the 
goal of our involvement is for Iraq to 
be able to ‘‘govern itself, sustain itself, 
defend itself.’’ 

In order for us to get to that point, 
we need to hold Iraqis accountable for 
meeting the benchmarks they helped 
set. The emergency supplemental bill 
that passed the House and the Senate 
does just that, by including a plan to 
redeploy U.S. forces in relation to 
progress made by the Iraqi Government 
in achieving security and diplomatic 
benchmarks. 

Leon Panetta also said: 

The worst mistake now would be to provide 
money for the war without sending the 
Iraqis any message at all about their responsibility 
for reforms. Both the President and 
the Congress at the very least must make 
the Iraqi Government understand that future 
financial and military support is going to depend 
on Baghdad’s making substantial 
progress toward the milestones Prime Minister 
Nuri al-Maliki has publicly committed 
to. 

The Iraq supplemental sends a strong 
message to the Iraqis that it is their 
responsibility to take control of their 
own country and that our involvement 
in Iraq is not indefinite. 

Vetoing the supplemental sends the 
message to the Iraqis that they do not 
have to take responsibility and that 
our troops will be in Iraq indefinitely. 
But staying in Iraq isn’t in the national 
interest or national security of 
the United States. 

Our troops are caught in the middle 
of a civil war they cannot solve. Keeping 
more troops there will only put 
them directly in the middle of an Iraqi 
fight. Keeping our troops there is trying 
to solve a political problem with a 
military solution. Staying in Iraq actually 
keeps the Iraqis from taking responsibility 
for their actions. 

Frankly, what we hear from the 
other side doesn’t make sense. They 
talk about victory, but what is the definition 
of ‘‘victory’’? Is that the victory 
we have heard is around the corner? 
They talk about benchmarks for 
the Iraqis, but they set no consequences. 


Four years after the President declared 
‘‘mission accomplished,’’ 4 years 
and over 3,000 Americans lives later, 4 
years and over $450 billion later, 4 
years with no new plan for Iraq, just 
more of the same, 4 years after the 
President declared ‘‘mission accomplished,’’ 
I ask: How many more lives 
must we lose and how much more 
money must we spend? 

I close by asking: When will this administration 
finally understand that 
‘‘mission accomplished’’ was a myth of 
their own imagination, born of delusion 
and denial, yet another terrible 
mistake in a series of tragic errors? 
When will we finally hear the words 
‘‘major combat in Iraq has ended’’ and 
know they are true? 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE). The Senator from Ohio. 

Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, 4 years 
ago today, as Senator MENENDEZ said, 
the President landed on an aircraft carrier, 
amid a flurry of pomp and circumstance, 
and declared, ‘‘Mission accomplished.’’ 


Since that day, much has happened. 
Since that day, 3,000 brave American 
soldiers and marines have died in Iraq. 
This war has gone on, since that day, 
longer than World War II. Since that 
day, the United Nations has estimated 
that 35,000 Iraqi civilians have been 
killed. Since that day, U.S. taxpayers 
have spent $450 billion on the war in 
Iraq. 

To get an understanding of what $450 
billion is, if we spent $500 every second 
of every minute of every hour of every 
day, it would take 29 years to spend the 
$450 billion we have spent in Iraq. 

Now, 4 years later, our troops in Iraq 
are stuck in the middle of a civil war. 
Too many of our brave soldiers do not 
have the body armor they need, in 
spite of the imploring of so many of us 
to the administration to do what they 
need to do to protect our soldiers. Now 
thousands of Guard men and women 
face early and extended redeployment. 

Four years later, the will of the people 
resonates in townhalls and in 


S5320 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

churches, in back yards and in living 
rooms across this country. Their message 
is clear: Mr. President, redeploy 
our troops out of Iraq. 

Up to now, however, the President 
has refused to hear the calls of millions 
of Americans. He has refused to listen 
to voters last fall who demanded a different 
course in Iraq. He has refused to 
listen to the Iraq Study Group, which 
recommended the redeployment of our 
troops out of Iraq. He has refused to 
listen to his own generals who have implored 
him, in many cases, to disengage 
from this civil war. He has refused 
to listen to Congress. 

The supplemental on its way to the 
White House echoes what many of us in 
Congress and military families across 
this great country have been saying: 
We need a new direction for Iraq. 

We take a backseat to no one in supporting 
the brave men and women 
fighting in Iraq. That is why so many 
of us have pushed this administration, 
pushed the civilian leadership in the 
Pentagon and in the White House to 
equip our soldiers with proper body 
armor. 

We take a backseat to no one in supporting 
the families of our soldiers 
overseas. That is why so many of us in 
this Chamber have pushed to help these 
support groups that have formed all 
over the country for soldiers and helping 
them reintegrate back into their 
jobs, back with their families and their 
society when they return home from 
Iraq. 

But more of the same is not a plan 
for our troops and will not end the war 
in Iraq. This war has made our country 
and our world less safe. Congress will 
continue to fight for our Nation’s military 
by working to see that they have 
the resources and the support they 
need and the leadership they deserve. 

This legislation fully funds and supports 
our troops, while establishing 
conditions that will bring our troops 
home. It provides desperately needed 
funding to the Veterans’ Administration, 
something this administration 
and previous Republican Congresses 
have woefully underfunded. It provides 
desperately needed funding to the Veterans’ 
Administration to help care for 
the hundreds of thousands of new veterans 
created by this war. 

If the President will not take responsibility 
for his failures in his conduct 
of this war, then Congress will. If the 
President will not lead our troops 
home, then Congress will. We owe it to 
our soldiers, to our sailors, to our airmen, 
airwomen, and to our marines, 
and we owe it to their families. 

Instead of threatening a veto, the 
President should listen to the military 
leaders, listen to the American people, 
and work with Congress to change the 
course in Iraq. 

Vetoing this legislation would deny 
funding our military and our veterans 
desperately need: $99 billion in emergency 
Department of Defense spending, 
more than the President’s budget; $3 
billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Pro


tected vehicles; $4.8 billion in military 
construction for BRAC, the Base Closing 
Commission; and the VA, which has 
been underfunded by $2 billion in the 
President’s budget, under this bill 
would get $1.7 billion immediately, 
more than the President’s VA proposal, 
and will do better in the next budget. 
It includes $100 million for VA mental 
health services. 

It is absolutely outrageous that this 
Congress—the House and Senate—and 
this President send our men and 
women off to war, not equipping them 
with the right body armor, not giving 
them the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected 
vehicles we know how to build 
in this country, and then when they return 
home, not giving tens of thousands 
of soldiers and marines the 
health care they deserve. 

In addition to what we do to restore 
that spending and take care of our veterans 
when they return home, this 
emergency legislation has over $1 billion 
for Katrina relief, $13 million for 
mine safety because of the increase in 
deaths in mines in places such as Pennsylvania 
and West Virginia, $625 million 
for the pandemic flu response, 
something we absolutely need to be 
prepared for, and $400 million for energy 
assistance for the low-income elderly. 


Please, Mr. President, before you decide 
to veto this bill, read this legislation. 
Don’t turn your back on millions 
of Americans, don’t turn your back on 
your military advisers and the military 
experts, don’t turn your back on our 
soldiers. Sign this legislation.

HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES 

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak about the issue of Iraq, 
to call on the President to sign the 
supplemental appropriations bill, the 
emergency bill that we will be sending 
him, and also to pay tribute to 43 
young Americans who have been killed 
in Iraq from my State since January 
30, 2007. This brings to 720 the number 
of soldiers who were either from California 
or based in California who have 
been killed while serving our country 
in Iraq. This represents 22 percent of 
all U.S. deaths in Iraq.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if you 
come to my office—I think you have 
had the opportunity to do so—you will 
see in front of the entrance at 112 Hart 
four huge placards with very small 
print paying tribute to those from California 
who have died in this conflict. 
The sadness of all sadness is that we 
keep having to send these posters back 
to be printed in yet smaller print because 
we keep having to add so many 
to it, and we are actually running out 
of space. We will have to get special 
permission from the Architect of the 
Capitol to place yet another placard in 
front of our door. 

But we will do it regardless because 
we must put names on this conflict, 
ages on this conflict, we must pay tribute 
to those who are being sacrificed, 
in my opinion, by a President who simply 
will not change course, for whatever 
reason, from a failed course. 

Anyone who reads the Constitution— 
I highly recommend it; it is a very 


S5322 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

readable document; it is a very concise 
document—will see that when it comes 
to war, there is a shared responsibility. 
As a matter of fact, if you read the 
Constitution, you will see Congress 
mentioned far more times, far many 
more times than the President. The 
President cannot act as if he is king. 
We already had a king, King George. 
We have a democracy. This is what the 
President says our young people are 
dying for in Iraq. Yet at home he acts 
as if he is a one-man show when it 
comes to Iraq. 

Mr. President, the American people 
said no to that this past election. Yet 
it continues as if there is no Congress, 
there has been no election, there has 
been no change of heart by the American 
people, when, in fact, there has 
been an enormous change of heart by 
the American people. That change of 
heart is reflected in the election, in the 
composition of this Senate, and you, 
Mr. President, actually are part of that 
change, that message that we wanted a 
change in the leadership. With all of 
this, it just goes on and on. 

Today is the fourth anniversary of 
the President’s speech that major combat 
operations are over. Four years ago 
he said that, in a military outfit. Yet, 
still, in today’s paper: April toll is 
highest of 2007 for U.S. troops. Over 100 
killed this month. The Iraqi deaths are 
far higher. 

Three years ago the President said: 
Major combat operations are over. 
Today we read: The deadliest month in 
2007. As a matter of fact, in the past 3 
days—as of yesterday, 3 days prior to 
that, we had 14 dead. That is about one 
for almost every person in the President’s 
Cabinet. 

What would it be like if 14 people sat 
around the President’s Cabinet table, 
and every one of them had lost a child? 
How long would this war last? How 
long would this war last? But who is 
paying the price? Who is paying the 
price? Our military families. They 
want a change. We want success. 

How do you get success? It is by 
changing course. It is what we sent the 
President. If you read what we sent the 
President in this emergency bill—I say 
to the Presiding Officer, I know you 
are so aware of it—it is a change in 
course. We are going to shift, as the 
Iraq Study Group suggested, from a 
combat mission to a support mission. 
We are going to gradually redeploy our 
troops out of there—not overnight—but 
sensibly. We are going to leave forces 
in Iraq to target al-Qaida, which never 
was in Iraq before this war, and now 
they are all over it because they want 
to go after our troops. So we are going 
to leave troops there in Iraq. That is 
what the Feingold-Reid-Boxer bill does 
as well. It says we have to have a mission 
there to go after al-Qaida when 
this war is over. We say training the 
troops is OK. Going after al-Qaida is 
what we want to do, and we want to 
have enough troops there for force protection. 


So anyone reading this—when the 
President says it is irresponsible, 

maybe he has not read it. There is 
time, Mr. President. You have not gotten 
this bill yet. Read it again. Look at 
it. We are changing course in a responsible 
way, the way the Iraqi Study 
Group that you praised says we should 
do. That was a bipartisan group. We all 
remember it: Secretary Baker, Lee 
Hamilton, and the others. 

Do you know why we have to change 
course? Because the mission you have 
given our military cannot be accomplished 
militarily. The mission now 
is—and since the mission has changed 
so many times, we have to go back. 
The mission now is: Bring stability and 
democracy to Iraq, and Iraq at peace 
within its own borders and with its 
neighbors, and an ally in the war 
against terror. That is the President’s 
goal. That is a political and diplomatic 
goal, I say to you, Mr. President. It is 
not a military goal. The military cannot 
do that. The military has done everything 
asked of it, and more. 

The first mission: Find the weapons 
of mass destruction. They went into 
every nook and cranny of Iraq. There 
were none. So that mission: done, accomplished. 


The President said: Go get Saddam. 
They did it. That mission: accomplished. 
That tyrant is gone forever. 

He said: Go get his sons because 
maybe they will get the idea we mean 
business. The military got his sons, put 
the pictures on television of their dead 
bodies. It did not do the job. 

What was the next mission? We have 
to hold elections. The military did a 
magnificent job. Three elections were 
actually held, and they have a government. 
Now, that Government will go 
on vacation, as I understand it, for 2 
months while our troops are dying. 

The fact is, the military has done 
every single thing asked of it. We are 
now at a point where the only way to 
win this war is to win it diplomatically, 
politically. Yet, this President 
will not change course. His solution is, 
more military action, a surge, which 
was supposed to last a few weeks—now 
we are being told a few months—and 
our military is paying the price. They 
are paying the price. 

I want to read from this news article 
today: ‘‘April Toll Is Highest of ’07 for 

U.S. Troops’’: 
On Monday, U.S. troops at Camp Victory, a 
sprawling base near Baghdad International 
Airport, reflected on April’s deadly toll on 
their comrades. . . . 
‘‘It makes me feel depressed to be in Iraq 
right now,’’ said [Private Richard] Gonzalez, 
[22 years old,] who is on his second deployment. 
‘‘It’s a whole lot different than last 
time.’’ 
Now, he said, soldiers at the base must 
carry weapons. Return addresses on letters 
from home must be ripped off and burned, so 
as not to fall into the wrong hands. On his 
first deployment, eight months passed before 
his Baghdad base was hit by mortar fire. 

This time, incoming fire every single 
day—4 years after ‘‘mission accomplished.’’ 


‘‘There’s a whole lot more activity,’’ 
said Spec. Krystal Fowler, 21, of Hamp


ton, Va. She said it ‘‘kind of bothers’’ 
her to know other troops are taking 
hits in the field and she can’t help. 

SPC Natisha Jetter said: 

Our fellow soldiers are out there dying, and 
we’re here. . . . 

Gonzales said the deaths made him realize 
that ‘‘there’s a war going on out there.’’ 

Fowler sighed. It’s a war between Iraqis, 
she said. 

‘‘We are just interfering, and letting our 
soldiers die.’’ 

‘‘I’d rather be out there helping people survive,’’ 
Fowler said. . . . 

There was a pause, as the soldiers mulled 
that. 

‘‘It’s just terrifying, because you can drive 
the same road for eight months, and then 
one day it’s over,’’ Gonzalez said. 

‘‘Over,’’ Fowler echoed. 

I ask, rhetorically, in light of what 
our troops are feeling, saying—going 
there for a second deployment, third 
deployment and more, and the increased 
number of deaths of our troops, 
and the horrific things that are happening 
in Iraq, detailed in the Red 
Cross report, which I ask unanimous 
consent to be printed in the RECORD, 
Mr. President, this International Red 
Cross report. 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 

CIVILIANS WITHOUT PROTECTION 
THE EVER-WORSENING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN 
IRAQ 
The humanitarian situation is steadily 
worsening and it is affecting, directly or indirectly, 
all Iraqis. 
Protecting Iraq’s civilian population must 
be a priority, and the ICRC urgently calls for 
better respect for international humanitarian 
law. It appeals to all those with military 
or political influence on the ground to 
act now to ensure that the lives of ordinary 
Iraqis are spared and protected. This is an 
obligation under international humanitarian 
law for both States and non-State actors. 
The ICRC aims to ensure that Iraqis receive 
the aid they need most. It cooperates 
closely with the Iraqi Red Crescent. However, 
humanitarian aid is clearly not enough 
when it comes to addressing the immense 
needs of Iraqis in the present disastrous security 
situation. 
A CONFLICT THAT SPARES NO ONE 
The conflict in Iraq is inflicting immense 
suffering on the entire population. Civilians 
bear the brunt of the relentless violence and 
the extremely poor security conditions that 
are disrupting the lives and livelihoods of 
millions. Every day, dozens of people are 
killed and many more wounded. The plight 
of Iraqi civilians is a daily reminder of the 
fact that there has long been a failure to respect 
their lives and dignity. 
Shootings, bombings, abductions, murders, 
military operations and other forms of violence 
are forcing thousands of people to flee 
their homes and seek safety elsewhere in 
Iraq or in neighbouring countries. The hundreds 
of thousands of displaced people scattered 
across Iraq find it particularly difficult 
to cope with the ongoing crisis, as do the 
families who generously agree to host them. 
Health-care facilities are stretched to the 
limit as they struggle to cope with mass casualties 
day-in, day-out. Many sick and injured 
people do not go to hospital because 
it’s too dangerous, and the patients and medical 
staff in those facilities are frequently 
threatened or targeted. 
Food shortages have been reported in several 
areas. According to the Iraqi Red Crescent, 
malnutrition has increased over the 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5323 

past year. The vastly inadequate water, sewage 
and electricity infrastructure is presenting 
a risk to public health. 

Unemployment and poverty levels are rising 
and many families continue to rely on 
government food distributions to cover their 
immediate needs. According to government 
sources, an estimated one third of the population 
lives in poverty, while over five percent 
live in extreme poverty. 

Much of Iraq’s vital infrastructure is in a 
poor state of repair owing to lack of maintenance 
and because security constraints have 
impeded repair work on electrical power 
grids, water and sanitation systems, medical 
facilities and other essential facilities. 

Power shortages are growing worse 
throughout the country, including northern 
areas, owing largely to the failure to carry 
out maintenance and to increase generation 
capacity. Fuel shortages affecting power stations 
and acts of sabotage are further aggravating 
the crisis. As a result, water-treatment 
plants, primary health-care centres 
and hospitals rely mainly on back-up generators, 
which often break down owing to excess 
usage or fall victim to the chronic fuel shortages. 


The destructive legacy of previous conflicts, 
from 1980 onwards, and the years of 
international sanctions imposed on Iraq 
after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 are further 
exacerbating the current crisis. 

THE ICRC IN IRAQ 
Despite the difficult security situation, the 
ICRC spares no effort to help the families 
most in need. It works closely with the Iraqi 
Red Crescent, which regularly distributes relief 
provided by the ICRC and collects and 
delivers Red Cross messages (brief personal 
messages to relatives made otherwise 
unreachable by armed conflict). 
The ICRC—a strictly humanitarian organization 
committed to the principles of neutrality, 
independence and impartiality— 
strives to monitor and promote respect for 
international humanitarian law and other 
legal standards applicable to the current situation 
in Iraq. 
SLIDING TO DISASTER 
Since the bombing of the sacred Shiite 
shrine of Samarra in February 2006 and the 
subsequent increase in violence, the problem 
of displacement in Iraq has become particularly 
acute. Thousands of Iraqis continue to 
be forced out of their homes owing to military 
operations, general poor security and 
the destruction of houses. And the outlook is 
bleak, particularly in Baghdad and other 
areas with mixed communities, where the 
situation is likely to worsen. 
Most displaced people have taken refuge 
with host families, who often struggle to 
cope with the additional burden on their limited 
resources. Some have found refuge in 
camps, public buildings and abandoned military 
barracks. Where displaced people decide 
to seek refuge often depends on the presence 
of relatives or friends and, because of the 
prevailing sectarian violence, on the religious 
or ethnic make-up of the host community. 
Frequently, both the displaced families 
and the communities hosting them are badly 
in need of shelter materials, access to clean 
water, adequate sanitation, food and other 
essentials. 
The displacement of hundreds of thousands 
of people places an additional burden on 
Iraq’s basic infrastructure, which is barely 
sufficient to serve the resident population. 
Humanitarian aid is needed by a wide 
range of particularly vulnerable. civilians, 
including elderly and disabled people and female-
headed households. 
MEDICAL CARE UNDER THREAT 
Medical professionals are fleeing the country 
in large numbers following the murder or 

abduction of colleagues. Hospitals and other 
key services are desperately short of qualified 
staff. According to the Iraqi Ministry of 
Health, more than half the doctors have left 
the country. 

The mass influx of casualties to hospitals 
following the daily attacks against civilians 
and other violent incidents is putting the 
health-care system under tremendous additional 
strain. Staff and resources are often 
stretched to the limit. 

The failure to observe the special status of 
medical staff and facilities is a major concern. 
A hospital director in Baghdad told the 
ICRC that poor security conditions were preventing 
staff from providing medical services. 
And there have been frequent reports of 
armed men storming hospitals and forcing 
doctors to give their companions priority 
treatment at the expense of others in more 
urgent need. 

Road-blocks and check-points sometimes 
prevent doctors and patients from reaching 
health-care centres in time. The lack of security 
also hampers the distribution of medical 
supplies in many parts of Iraq. 

DIRTY AND SCARCE—THE WATER CRISIS 
Both the quantity and quality of drinking 
water in Iraq remain insufficient despite 
limited improvements in some areas, mainly 
in the south. Water is often contaminated 
owing to the poor repair of sewage and 
water-supply networks and the discharge of 
untreated sewage into rivers, which are the 
main source of drinking water. Electricity 
and fuel shortages and the poor maintenance 
of infrastructure mean that there is no reg


ular and reliable supply of clean water and 
that sewage is often not properly disposed of. 
TORN APART—THE FATE OF SEPARATED 
FAMILIES 

Tens of thousands of people are currently 
being detained by the Iraqi authorities and 
the multinational forces in Iraq. Many families 
remain without news of relatives who 
went missing during past conflicts or the 
current hostilities. 

Visiting people detained in connection 
with the armed conflict in Iraq remains a humanitarian 
priority for the ICRC. Persons 
held by the multinational forces or the Kurdish 
regional government are regularly visited 
to assess their conditions of detention 
and treatment. 

THE ICRC IN 2006 

Over 227,000 people, mostly members of displaced 
families, received food aid in various 
parts of Iraq. Over 161,000 people received essential 
household items. 

Some 83,000 people, including members of 
displaced families, had their water supply 
ensured through emergency ICRC water and 
sanitation projects. 

In all, over four million people benefited 
from water and sanitation projects. 

Twenty major hospitals in Hilla, Baghdad, 
Diwaniya, Karbala, Najaf and Tal Afar received 
medical and surgical supplies for the 
treatment of wounded patients. 

Eight limb-fitting centres in Baghdad, 
Hilla, Najaf and Basra were supported by the 
ICRC, as was an Iraqi Red Crescent centre in 
Mosul. This was in addition to the Arbil centre, 
which is run entirely by the ICRC. In all, 
these centres helped nearly 21,000 patients, 
who received 7,300 artificial and some 460 
pairs of crutches. 

Twelve hospital emergency wards received 
new equipment. 

Ten hospitals, with a combined capacity to 
treat some 5,000 inpatients, had their water 
and sanitation systems repaired. 

Sixty-seven primary health-care centres in 
Anbar, Babel, Baghdad, Diwaniya, Karbala, 
Salah AI Deen and Wasit governorates had 
their sanitation facilities repaired or up


graded. They treat an average of over 9,000 
patients per day. 

More than 32,000 detainees were visited, almost 
9,000 of them individually, during 109 
visits to 28 places of detention. 

Nearly 6,400 detainees held in Camp Bucca 
and in the Shaiba facility benefited from the 
ICRC family-visit programme. 

Nearly 37,000 Red Cross messages were delivered 
and over 30,500 collected by the ICRC 
in conjunction with the Iraqi Red Crescent. 

Mrs. BOXER. This report is called 
‘‘Civilians Without Protection.’’ I will 
go into it in a minute. But in light of 
everything that is happening, how on 
Earth could the President sit in the 
Oval Office and say: ‘‘I am vetoing this 
bill that is coming to me, and I want to 
just continue what I am doing’’? A 
military solution is what he is doing, 
and he is going to continue it. 

In light of everything that has gone 
on, doesn’t this President understand 
it is time for a change? Doesn’t he listen 
to the voters? Doesn’t he read 
these articles? ‘‘Send me the bill. I am 
going to veto it’’—very macho like. I 
do not think it is macho like. I think 
it is wrong. I do not think it is brave to 
continue a policy that is failing. I do 
not think it is courageous not to admit 
it is time for a change. I do not think 
it shows strength. I think it is stubborn. 
I think it is wrong. And, worst of 
all, our troops are paying the price for 
this stubbornness. This is not the same 
as being stubborn in an argument we 
might have about some small matter. 
Oh, I think this book is better than 
this book, and I think this singer is 
better than this one. This is involving 
the lives of our soldiers. 

Now, this ‘‘Civilians Without Protection’’ 
report is very tough to read, by 
the International Red Cross. Let me 
share some of it with you: the pictures, 
the headlines, the words. 

One section is called ‘‘A conflict that 
spares no one.’’ 

In some regions, particularly Baghdad and 
area, families are often too afraid to leave 
their homes to go to work or to shop and too 
afraid to send their children to school because 
of random violence and the threat of 
kidnapping for ransom. 

This one is very tough to take—very 
tough to take. It is written by a young 
humanitarian worker from Baghdad. It 
is in the Red Cross report. 

Once I was called to an explosion site. 
There I saw a four-year-old boy sitting beside 
his mother’s body, which had been decapitated 
by the explosion. He was talking to 
her, asking her what had happened. He had 
been taken out shopping by his mom. 

How do you sit back and say ‘‘status 
quo’’? How? How? Why not welcome a 
change? Why not welcome the Iraq 
Study Group? Why not welcome the 
work that has been done here in 50, 60 
different hearings which we have held? 

Another part: ‘‘Sliding to disaster,’’ 
in the International Red Cross report. 
Another part: ‘‘Medical care under 
threat.’’ Another part: ‘‘Dirty and 
scarce—the water crisis.’’ Another 
part: ‘‘Torn apart—The fate of separated 
families.’’ It goes into the agony. 
I ask us all to imagine what it would

be like to worry about our kids for 
even 15 minutes, let alone days and 
months. 

This Red Cross report is printed in

Mr. President, also, I ask unanimous 
consent that the entire article I referred 
to from the newspaper be printed 
in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the

APRIL TOLL IS HIGHEST OF ’07 FOR U.S. 
TROOPS 
(By Sudarsan Raghavan and Karin Brulliard) 

BAGHDAD, April 30.—The deaths of more 
than 100 American troops in April made it 
the deadliest month so far this year for U.S. 
forces in Iraq, underscoring the growing exposure 
of Americans as thousands of reinforcements 
arrive for an 11-week-old offensive 
to tame sectarian violence. 

More than 60 Iraqis also were killed or 
found dead across Iraq on Monday. Casualties 
among Iraqi civilians and security forces 
have outstripped those of Americans 
throughout the war. In March, a total of 
2,762 Iraqi civilians and policemen were 
killed, down 4 percent from the previous 
month, when 2,864 were killed. Iraq’s government 
has yet to release any monthly totals 
for April. 

Attacks killed a total of nine U.S. troops 
over the weekend, including five whose 
deaths were announced Monday. The weekend’s 
fatalities brought the toll for the 
month to 104 Americans killed, in the sixth 
most-lethal month for American forces since 
the U.S.-led invasion four years ago. 

Under the new counterinsurgency plan, 
many U.S. forces have left large, more secure 
bases to live in small combat outposts and to 
patrol hostile neighborhoods where the risk 
of insurgents targeting them has multiplied. 

Highlighting the vulnerability of American 
forces, a series of explosions Monday night 
rocked Baghdad’s Green Zone, the most 
heavily secured enclave in the capital and 
home to thousands of U.S. troops, Western 
diplomats and Iraqi government officials. 

‘‘There is a duck-and-cover going on right 
now,’’ said Lt. Col. Christopher C. Garver, a 

U.S. military spokesman, before quickly getting 
off the phone. Later, Garver confirmed 
there had been an assault on the Green Zone, 
but it was unclear what had happened. Local 
Iraqi television stations reported 10 explosions 
inside the zone. There were no immediate 
reports of casualties, Garver said. 
In eastern Baghdad on Sunday, a roadside 
bomb killed three U.S. soldiers and an Iraqi 
interpreter who were on patrol, the military 
said. Attackers shot dead another soldier in 
the same section of the capital on Saturday. 
Meanwhile, a Marine was killed in the Sunni 
insurgent bastion of Anbar province, west of 
Baghdad. On Saturday, the military reported 
four U.S. soldiers had been killed on that 
day. 

Before the deaths announced Monday, 99 

U.S. soldiers had been killed during April, 
according to iCasualties.org, an independent 
Web site that monitors military deaths. 
Nearly half have died in and around Baghdad, 
with the next greatest number of deaths 
occurring in Anbar and Diyala provinces. In 
December, 112 U.S. soldiers were killed. 
With 11 combat deaths, April also was the 
deadliest month for British troops in Iraq 
since the beginning of the war, when 27 soldiers 
were killed in March 2003. This month’s 
British casualties highlighted the growing 
tensions in southern Iraq as Shiite groups 

clash for power and Britain prepares to draw 
down its forces. 

The deaths came as the largest bloc of 
Sunnis in Iraq’s parliament, the Iraqi Accordance 
Front, threatened to pull out its 
ministers from the cabinet, saying that it 
‘‘had lost hope’’ in having Sunni concerns 
addressed by the Shiite-led government. The 
threat prompted President Bush to phone 
one of Iraq’s two vice presidents, Tariq al-
Hashimi, a Sunni, in an attempt to defuse 
the potential political crisis, Hashimi’s office 
said in a statement. A Sunni withdrawal 
could seriously hamper efforts at national 
reconciliation and further weaken the government. 
Only two weeks ago, six cabinet 
ministers loyal to Shiite cleric Moqtada al-
Sadr resigned from the cabinet. 

In the province of Diyala, where scores of 
fighters have fled to escape the Baghdad security 
offensive, a car bomb exploded near a 
funeral tent in the town of Khalis, killing 22 
and wounding 35, said Lt. Mohammed 
Hakman of the Diyala police Joint Coordination 
Center. Police said they expected the 
toll to rise. 

The strike came four days after a suicide 
attacker detonated a car packed with bombs 
at a checkpoint in the town, 50 miles north 
of Baghdad, killing 10 Iraqi soldiers. 

Near the Sunni insurgent stronghold of 
Ramadi, a car bomb exploded at a police 
checkpoint, killing four policemen and injuring 
six others, police said. In another attack 
near Ramadi, a truck exploded near a restaurant, 
killing four civilians, police said. 

In Baghdad, a car bomb exploded in the al-
Jihad neighborhood, killing four and wounding 
another seven, all civilians, while another 
car bomb detonated in a local market, 
killing five and wounding nine civilians. In 
the Shaab neighborhood, mortar shells 
rained down on a house, killing three and injuring 
eight, police said. 

Meanwhile, police found 13 corpses—all 
blindfolded, handcuffed and shot in the 
head—in different parts of the capital. 

On Monday, U.S. troops at Camp Victory, a 
sprawling base near Baghdad International 
Airport, reflected on April’s deadly toll on 
their comrades. 

Sitting at a picnic table outside a recreation 
center, four soldiers smoked Marlboros 
under a starry sky. Part of the Headquarters 
Headquarters Support Company for the 3rd 
Infantry Division out of Fort Stewart, Ga., 
they had arrived last month. They were on 
the base, just ‘‘sweeping parking lots and 
waiting for a sandstorm,’’ as Pfc. Richard 
Gonzalez, 22, put it. 

Still, they said, frequent news of troop 
deaths made even their mission more frightening. 


‘‘It makes me feel depressed to be in Iraq 
right now,’’ said Gonzalez, who is on his second 
deployment. ‘‘It’s a whole lot different 
than last time.’’ 

Now, he said, soldiers at the base must 
carry weapons. Return addresses on letters 
from home must be ripped off and burned, so 
as not to fall into the wrong hands. On his 
first deployment, eight months passed before 
his Baghdad base was hit by mortar fire. 
This time, he said, it seems the Camp Victory 
intercom announces incoming fire every 
day. 

‘‘There’s a whole lot more activity,’’ said 
Spec. Krystal Fowler, 21, of Hampton, Va. 
She said it ‘‘kind of bothers’’ her to know 
other troops are taking hits in the field and 
she can’t help. 

Spec. Natisha Jetter, 23, of Charlotte 
Amalie, St Thomas, in the Virgin Islands, 
agreed. 

‘‘Our fellow soldiers are out there dying, 
and we’re here not doing our job,’’ Jetter 
said. 

Gonzalez said the deaths made him realize 
that ‘‘there’s a war going on out there.’’ 

Fowler sighed. It’s a war between Iraqis, 
she said. 

‘‘We are just interfering, and letting our 
soldiers die.’’ 

‘‘I’d rather be out there helping people survive,’’ 
Fowler said. ‘‘The more of us that are 
out there, the more chances they have to 
survive.’’ 

There was a pause, as the soldiers mulled 
that. 

‘‘It’s just terrifying, because you can drive 
the same road for eight months, and then 
one day it’s over,’’ Gonzalez said. 

‘‘Over,’’ Fowler echoed. 

Mrs. BOXER. This President’s policies 
left unchecked have been a disaster. 
And what does he want? More of 
the same. He criticizes us for coming 
up with a new policy, and this new policy 
will work because it combines a 
gradual redeployment of troops, a focus 
on getting al-Qaida, a focus on training 
the Iraqis, with a focus on diplomacy 
and a political solution, which is exactly 
what everyone says we need. 

General Petraeus says we must have 
a political and diplomatic solution. 
Well, everyone has heard it, but obviously 
not this President. Mr. President, 
sign this bill. Have a change of 
heart. Read the paper today. Read the 
quote from this humanitarian worker. 
Read what our troops are saying. Read 
about it. Reconsider. 

Also, Mr. President, take a look at 
what we have done for our people here 
at home in this bill. You deride it. You 
make it sound as though we are spending 
on things we should not. Why 
shouldn’t we fix Walter Reed? Why 
shouldn’t we fix the Veterans’ Administration 
so when our soldiers come 
home they get mental health care? 
Why shouldn’t we invest in better technologies 
to protect our troops from 
these horrific land mines, car bombs, et 
cetera? That is what is in this bill. 

Why shouldn’t we help our farmers 
who lost their money because of horrific 
droughts, horrific frosts? That is 
what these bills are for, emergencies. 
On Sunday, we all learned about the 
horror that happened in Oakland, with 
a gasoline tanker overturning on a 
major interstate connecter. It collapsed 
onto the freeway below. Miracle 
of miracles: the middle of the night, in 
the early morning, 3:40 or so a.m. No 
one killed. Thank you, God. And we 
pray that the driver survives. 

But here is the point: There is money 
in this bill for emergencies such as 
that. There is a backlog of these emergency 
fixes that have had to be done to 
our freeways. So, Mr. President, there 
is real beef in this bill for our people, 
for our veterans, for our fighting men 
and women. And, most important, we 
change course. We change course. We 
don’t have a hard-and-fast date to get 
out, as others have said. We have a 
goal to get out: in April of 2008. 

When I went to Iraq 2 years ago, I 
met with General Petraeus at length. I 
watched how he was training the Iraqi 
soldiers. He was very complimentary. 
He said they are doing great. I said to 
him: If they are doing so great, why 
can’t we go home? It is their country. 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5325 

They have to defend their own country. 
He said: Well, pretty soon they will be 
able to do it. Clearly, they are not 
doing it. Clearly, the Iraqis are turning 
on each other. What is our military to 
do? 

As Thomas Friedman said, 

Our troops are protecting everyone, and 
yet they are everyone’s target. 

They are protecting the Sunnis from 
the Shia. When they are protecting the 
Shia, the Sunnis get them. That is an 
irresponsible policy. So what we need 
to do is get through to this President. 
I ask all the American people to keep 
on speaking out, to ask the President 
in these next couple of hours to sign 
this bill. We can finally change course. 
We have been in Iraq longer than World 
War II. We can’t afford this conflict, 
and that doesn’t mean you cut and run. 
Anyone who says that is what we are 
saying is wrong. Read the bill. We redeploy 
out of Iraq, we stay in the region 
to go after al-Qaida and to train the 
Iraqi forces. 

We can’t afford this anymore. Mr. 
President: Sign the bill. 

I yield the floor. 

Mr. President, I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The assistant legislative clerk proceeded 
to call the roll. 

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

POLICE CHASES 
Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would 
like to talk about a decision by the Supreme 
Court yesterday that greatly 
troubles me. Some many years ago, I 
received a call at 10:31 in the evening 
that my mother had been killed in a 
car accident. She was killed in a car 
accident as a result of a high-speed police 
chase. My mother was driving 
home from visiting a friend in the hospital, 
going 25 or 30 miles an hour on a 
street in Bismarck, ND. A drunk, on 
Main Street in Bismarck, ND, was 
spinning his wheels on his pickup 
truck, and the police then decided to 
apprehend him. The drunk driver took 
flight. Witnesses said he was going 80 
to 100 miles an hour on the city streets. 
Regrettably, that ended in a tragic 
crash that took the life of my mother. 
I have spent many years here in Congress 
talking about this issue of police 
chases and training for law enforcement 
officials, about guidelines—when 
to chase, when not to chase. I have 
been joined by a good number of people 
around this country who have lost 
loved ones, innocent loved ones who 
were killed as a result of high-speed police 
chases. One who came to mind was 
a former member of law enforcement 
whose family member was killed when 
someone with a taillight that was out 
was to be apprehended by the police, 
and he took flight and the police 

chased at very high speeds. The family 
member of this law enforcement official 
was killed as a result. 

In the middle of working on this, 
over the years, a county sheriff called 
me one day. He heard me speak about 
it. He said: You know, just last week 
we had a man who was a drunk driver 
in our community who had two little 
children in the backseat. The sheriff’s 
department attempted to apprehend 
that driver, and he took off at a high 
rate of speed. The sheriff’s office decided 
to discontinue the chase immediately. 
They got a license number. 
They discontinued the chase. Three 
hours later, they arrested the man. 

He said: It could have turned out differently. 
We could have chased that 
man at 80 to 100 miles an hour, and the 
end of that chase could have resulted 
in the death of those children in the 
backseat of that car. But we didn’t do 
that because we had guidelines and we 
had training. 

The Supreme Court yesterday issued 
a ruling, regrettably, that I believe will 
result in more deaths in this country, 
deaths of innocent bystanders, as a result 
of high-speed police chases. I think 
the ruling is a horrible ruling. 

Incidentally, the Supreme Court, apparently 
for the first time in history, 
put a video on their Web site so people 
could see the chase which was the subject 
of the decision in the case they 
were considering. Let me suggest to 
the Supreme Court that perhaps they 
could put some other videos on their 
Web site. I know high-speed police 
chases have become a form of television 
entertainment all too often, but 
they all too often end in disaster and 
end with innocent people losing their 
lives. There are other videos they could 
perhaps put on their Web site, if the 
Supreme Court were interested. Among 
those videos might be the resulting 
crashes of high-speed police chases in 
the middle of our cities, at 80 and 100 
miles an hour, where innocent bystanders 
ended up losing their lives. 

I understand why the police chase 
when there is a felony, a bank robbery, 
a serious crime. I understand that. 
What I don’t understand is this: why 
chases ensue in these communities because 
of a broken taillight or a person 
going 5 miles an hour over the speed 
limit and a chase ensues. Yes, the responsibility 
is in the person fleeing the 
police. Yes, that is the case, I understand 
that. But that does not give rise, 
in my judgment, to reason to endanger 
people on the city streets with chases 
at 60, 80, or 100 miles an hour. That is 
not justified. 

Law enforcement needs guidelines. 
They need training to understand what 
the consequences are—when to chase, 
when not to chase. Regrettably, I believe 
the Supreme Court ruling yesterday 
will result in more high-speed police 
chases and more deaths of innocent 
Americans. That is a profound disappointment, 
not just to me but to 
many others in this country who have 
seen the results of these high-speed 
chases. 

CONCLUSION OF MORNING

PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE 
AMENDMENTS OF 2007 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will resume 
consideration of S. 1082, which 
the clerk will report. 

The legislative clerk read as follows: 

A bill (S. 1082) to amend the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act to reauthorize and 
amend the prescription drug user fee provisions, 
and for other purposes. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time 
until 12:30 is to be evenly divided between 
the majority leader and Republican 
leader and to be used for debate 
only. 

The Senator from North Dakota is 
recognized. 

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that Senator 
BOXER from California be recognized 
for 15 minutes, obviously as the next 
Democratic speaker following my presentation. 


The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have 
come to the floor to talk about the underlying 
bill that is being considered, a 
piece of legislation to amend the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to 
reauthorize and amend the prescription 
drug user fee provisions and so on. It 
may be that there will be an agreement 
by which I and some others who will 
offer legislation or an amendment to 
deal with the issue of prescription drug 
prices will do that at another time and 
not on this bill. If that is the case, I am 
fine with that. I understand there are 
discussions underway now. I would be 
perfectly amenable to not offering an 
amendment on this legislation and instead 
having an opportunity to offer it 
at a different time. That amendment is 
about the reimportation of prescription 
drugs. 

Let me talk just a little about this 
issue. This is an issue which is getting 
a gray beard these days because it has 
been around so long with so many 
promises to be able to take it up here 
in the Congress. We have 33 cosponsors 
on a piece of legislation that would try 
to break the back of the pricing monopoly 
that exists with the pharmaceutical 
industry for prescription drugs 
in our country. The fact is, the American 
consumers are charged the highest 
prices for prescription drugs anywhere 
in the world. The highest prices for 
prescription drugs are charged to the 
American consumer. It is not right. It 
is not fair. It ought to stop. We do have 
price controls on prescription drugs in 
our country; they are just controlled 
by the pharmaceutical industry. That 
is why we have the highest prices in 
the world. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
to show a couple of bottles of medicine. 



S5326 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, these 
two bottles of medicine are Lipitor. 
Lipitor is a very common prescription 
drug used by many Americans to reduce 
cholesterol. As you can see, this 
drug, Lipitor, is made in Ireland, as a 
matter of fact, and then imported into 
this country by the pharmaceutical industry. 
From Ireland it is sent many 
places, but in this case the bottle in 
my left hand was sent to Canada, and 
the bottle in my right hand was sent to 
the United States. Same bottle, same 
pill, slightly different color on the 
front of it. It is an FDA-approved medicine 
produced in an FDA-approved 
plant in Ireland and then sent to Canada 
and the United States. 

The difference? No difference—same 
plastic in the bottle, same medicine inside—
except the price. The Canadian 
pays $1.83 per tablet, and the American 
pays $3.57—96 percent more. Let me say 
that again: No difference, same medicine, 
same bottle, same price, made in 
the same plant, FDA approved. Difference? 
The American consumer is 
told: Guess what, we have a special 
deal for you, you get to pay 96 percent 
more for the same medicine. 

Is this unusual? No, it is not. I sat on 
a hay bale one day at a farm with an 
old codger. He was in his eighties. This 
is in North Dakota. He said: You know, 
my wife has been fighting breast cancer. 
She has fought this now for 3 
years. We have gone to Canada. We had 
to go to Canada to get the medicine, to 
buy Tamoxifen, and the reason we had 
to drive to Canada every 3 months or 
so to get the medicine is we save 80 
percent by buying it in Canada. We 
cannot afford the price in the United 
States. We can’t afford the price to 
have my wife fight this breast cancer. 

The question is, Is it just Canada? 
No, not at all, but let me at least describe 
the situation with the United 
States and Canada. I could put up the 
chart with Italy, Spain, Germany, 
France, England—I could put up this 
chart with virtually every country because 
the U.S. consumer pays the highest 
prices in the world. 

Lipitor, I just described it; Plavix, we 
pay 46 percent more; Prevacid we pay 
97 percent more; Zocor, 31 percent 
more, Nexium, 55 percent; Zoloft, 52 
percent more. The list goes on and on, 
as you might imagine. 

We have a population that receives a 
lot of benefit from miracle drugs. 
There are prescription drugs that allow 
you to manage your disease without 
having to go to an acute care bed in a 
hospital. It is a wonderful thing. 

A substantial portion of the research 
to develop those drugs is done in the 
National Institutes of Health, paid for 
by us. We turn that research over to 
the prescription drug industry, they 
produce medicine from it, and then 
they sell us the medicine. 

Another body of research is done by 
the prescription drug industry themselves. 
They spend a lot of money on 

that. They also spend a lot of money on 
advertising and promotion. Now, anyone 
who was standing in front of a mirror 
this morning brushing their teeth, 
shaving, perhaps getting ready for 
work and had their television on, one 
of those little television sets, if they 
have one, anyone who was engaged in 
doing that probably saw a television 
commercial. It said this: You should go 
ask your doctor whether the purple pill 
is right for you. It didn’t necessarily 
tell you what the purple pill was for; it 
just says you need to talk to your doctor 
to see if you should have the purple 
pill. 

It also makes you want to run out 
and say: Hey, what is this purple pill? 
Maybe I should have some of those purple 
pills, without knowing what they 
are for. It goes on all day, every day, 
advertising directly to consumers for 
medicines that can only be prescribed 
by a doctor for a prescription saying: 
Go talk to your doctor. Wouldn’t you 
like some of these pills? We have an 
unbelievable amount of promotion and 
advertising with respect to prescription 
drugs. That is another issue. I believe 
there is only one other industrialized 
country that allows that; that is 
New Zealand. But that is another issue 
for another time. 

The issue is pricing. I have described 
what is happening with respect to pricing. 
This is Canada, but I can describe 
it for other countries as well. The percent 
of adults, ages 19 to 64, not filling 
a prescription because of cost, 43 percent 
of the uninsured in this country— 
that is 45, 46 million—do not take their 
medicine because they do not have the 
money. They say it costs too much. 

The result? Well, often many of them 
will end up in the priciest kind of 
health care, some kind of an acute care 
bed through an emergency room in a 
hospital. 

The legislation we have developed in 
Congress is bipartisan. It stretches 
from—I shouldn’t say stretches because 
I am not describing the polls in Congress. 
But we have TED KENNEDY, Democrat; 
CHUCK GRASSLEY, Republican; 
DEBBIE STABENOW, Democrat; JOHN 
MCCAIN, Republican; back and forth. 
Bipartisan support for a piece of legislation 
we have crafted very carefully 
that says: Why shouldn’t the American 
people be able to take advantage of 
FDA-approved drugs by reimporting 
them from another country where that 
same drug is sold for a fraction of the 
price? Why shouldn’t the global economy 
work for consumers as well? This 
is bipartisan legislation that has substantial 
areas of safety built into it, so 
there is no safety issue. This is from 
Dr. David Kessler, who was head of the 
FDA for 8 years, 1990 to 1997. ‘‘The Dorgan-
Snowe bill’’—OLYMPIA SNOWE is 
the principal cosponsor, along with me 
and many others who have worked on 
this—Senator STABENOW and Senator 
MCCAIN and others for a long time, 
Senator KENNEDY. 

The Dorgan-Snowe bill provides a sound 
framework for assuring that imported drugs 

are safe and effective. Most notably, it provides 
additional resources to the agency to 
run such a program, oversight by the FDA of 
the chain of custody of imported drugs back 
to the FDA-inspected plants, a mechanism to 
review imported drugs to ensure that they 
meet FDA’s approval standards, and the registration 
and oversight of importers and exporters 
to assure that the imported drugs 
meet these standards and are not counterfeit. 


Let me show you where your prescription 
drugs come from. The pharmaceutical 
industry is engaged in a 
full court press with Members of this 
Chamber. They have a fair number of 
friends in this Chamber who would 
want to help them derail this legislation 
and continue to be able to charge 
the highest prices to the American consumer. 


Lipitor comes from Dublin, Ireland. 
Nexium comes from France. Of course, 
these are all imported by the pharmaceutical 
manufacturers themselves. 
Any one of these—Vytorin, Singapore, 
Italy, the United Kingdom; Actos 
comes from Osaka, Japan. All of these 
are made in other countries, brought 
back to this country, and, by the way, 
sold in every other country in most 
cases for a lower price than when they 
are sent back to this country by the 
manufacturer. 

The legislation we have introduced is 
very simple. It gives the American consumer 
the opportunity to take advantage 
of lower prices for an FDA-approved 
drug; in many cases, by the 
way, a drug that was created with the 
very research that the American people 
paid for through the National Institutes 
of Health. 

Some have said, as a result of the 
pharmaceutical industry’s entreaties 
here, well, this can’t be done safely. It 
cannot be done safely. Well, apparently, 
they do it safely. The chain of 
custody, for example, in Canada is virtually 
identical. I had a quote that I do 
not have here. I had a quote from Dr. 
McClelland, the former head of the 
FDA, virtually identical chain of custody 
from Canada as opposed to the 
United States between the pharmaceutical 
manufacturer, the wholesaler, 
and the retailer. 

So is the chain of custody in Canada 
safe with respect to prescription drugs 
being sold to Canadian consumers? The 
answer is yes. So why would you not be 
able to establish a regime, just as they 
have in Europe for many years, called 
parallel trading? This is not new. If 
you are in Europe and you are living in 
Germany and want to buy a prescription 
from Spain, or living in Italy and 
find a prescription drug priced lower in 
France through a parallel trading system, 
you can easily do that. 

To my knowledge, we have testimony 
from one of the people involved. To my 
knowledge, there have been no issues of 
safety at all. They have done it for 20 
years. Are those who oppose this saying, 
well, the Europeans are smarter 
than we are, they can do it but we 
can’t? I don’t understand that. That is 
not the case. I don’t understand that. 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5327 

This is a very simple case. We propose 
an amendment that would allow drug 
reimportation and would make it safe. 
That is the fact. 

We understand that the pharmaceutical 
industry does not like it. That 
is a fact, too. I understand why they 
don’t like it. 

Suppose I were running a pharmaceutical 
company and had the ability 
to price however I wanted to price inside 
the United States, one of the most 
important markets in the world, perhaps 
the most important market in the 
world, and I would have no competition 
from lower prices because I was able to 
keep that out. I understand why they 
would like to keep that deal working 
for them, but it does not work for the 
American people. It is not fair for the 
American people; it just isn’t. 

That is why we have put together a 
bipartisan piece of legislation, the Dorgan-
Snowe bill, that is supported by 
Republicans and Democrats, which now 
has 33 cosponsors. It is one that should 
pass in the Senate. The House has already 
passed a similar piece of legislation 
in the last session. I believe, finally, 
given a fair opportunity—and I 
believe we will be given that fair opportunity 
whether it is on this bill or 
perhaps with some consent to do it on 
another bill, I believe we will get this 
done. 

This is important. There are some 
things we do that are not very important 
at all. My criticism—it is a great 
privilege to serve here. My criticism of 
this place is from time to time we treat 
the light way too seriously, and we 
treat the serious far too lightly. This is 
a serious issue that deserves to be 
treated seriously. 

It has been around for a long time. 
We have not had a vote on it only because 
we have been blocked by, I would 
say, Senator Frist, the majority leader, 
for a long time, despite what I thought 
and my colleagues thought was a representation 
by him that he would allow 
us to have this on the Senate floor. He 
continued to block it. 

I understand the pharmaceutical industry 
is pulling out all of the stops. 
They have a full court press, trying to 
find as many Members of the Senate as 
they can who will stand up for their 
current pricing strategy. And they will 
find a few, no question about that. I 
think there are some Members of the 
Congress who like the pricing strategy 
of saying let’s price drugs so that the 
American people pay the highest prices 
in the world. But I am very anxious to 
get them here to the floor to debate 
them on that subject because they are 
wrong. It is just wrong. It is wrong to 
do this to the American people. 

One final point. I don’t disrespect the 
pharmaceutical industry. I say good for 
you when you produce a miracle drug, 
a lifesaving drug. But miracle drugs 
offer no miracles to people who can’t 
afford to buy them. My problem with 
the pharmaceutical industry is the 
pricing strategy, the pricing strategy 
which says to the American people: 

You pay the highest prices in the 
world, and there is nothing we will let 
you do that can alter that. That is 
wrong. That is why I and others come 
to the floor of the Senate to say let’s 
fix this. Not later, let’s fix this now. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from California is recognized. 

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank 
my colleague, Senator DORGAN, for all 
his hard work on this issue of afford-
ability of prescription drugs. He has 
been such a consistent voice. I stand 
with him on that. I thank him. 

(The further remarks of Mrs. BOXER 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
Morning Business). 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR). The Senator from Wyoming 
is recognized. 

Mr. ENZI. Madam President, this 
morning there have been a couple of 
topics brought up. The bill before us, of 
course, is the reauthorization of the 
Food and Drug Administration, several 
important parts of the Food and Drug 
Administration, and a new section on 
drug safety to give the Food and Drug 
Administration a few more tools for 
their tool box. So I will stick to that 
topic instead of addressing the one 
more recently brought up. I have some 
very strong feelings on that and some 
very strong opinions on how America 
ought to be involved in the war and 
what the consequences are of us pulling 
out. However, I want to stick to the 
topic of the day, which is our pharmaceutical 
supply. 

Most Americans who turn to imported 
drugs do so because of the cost. 
We need to answer a lot of questions 
before we open our borders to imported 
drugs to be sure we don’t endanger consumers 
or jeopardize research or jeopardize 
the development of new lifesaving 
products. Senator DORGAN, of 
course, introduced a bill last year. He 
made the statement that miracle drugs 
provide no miracles for those who can’t 
afford them. I don’t think there is anybody 
in this Chamber who couldn’t 
agree more with that statement, but I 
am sure they would agree that a counterfeit 
or tainted drug is unsafe at any 
price. 

As we consider the issue of drug importation, 
the safety of our citizens 
must be our primary concern. As ranking 
member of the committee charged 
with public health, it is certainly mine. 
You will find the focus of the bill that 
is before us to be on safety. I think everything 
in the bill leads to safety. I 
don’t want to come up with a 
countersituation now that might put 
people at risk. 

I am reminded we are going to have 
a little bit of debate on the safety of 
our food supply—we talked about that 
a little bit last night—because there is 
a crisis with pet food, in particular, but 
even some potential for human consumption, 
partly because of the pet 
food, partly because of some other possibilities. 
There are some kids dying in 
China because they have melamine in 

their food. This is a product that is 
added to food to increase the appearance 
of protein. If you add that to 
grains or other things, you can get a 
higher protein count, and usually the 
protein count relates to the price you 
get. The more protein, the higher the 
price. 

I was talking to the Senator from 
Colorado, Mr. ALLARD, who is a veterinarian, 
and he was pointing out this 
morning that if you take a fingernail, 
that is 100 percent protein. If you take 
the liver, that is 100 percent protein. 
One of the differences is if you grind 
liver up and you put it in food, it is digestible. 
If you grind a fingernail up 
and put it in food, it isn’t digestible at 
all. So you are not getting any protein 
out of it. So kids have died in China 
who thought they were getting sufficient 
food, and they weren’t. The cause 
of death was starvation. One of the 
countries that could be getting drugs 
to the United States would be China. If 
they are fooling with our food supply, 
do you think they would hesitate a 
minute to fool with our prescription 
drug supply? It worries me a lot. There 
is a lot of risk that is involved in this. 

The Senator from North Dakota held 
up two bottles. The bottles were identical. 
One was cheaper in Canada than 
the same bottle in the United States. 
In a minute, I will go into how that 
price difference happens. I could hold 
up two bottles that would look exactly 
the same. One would appear to come 
from Canada, but it might very well 
come through Canada from Saudi Arabia, 
have exactly the same packaging, 
labeling, colors, seals, even the same 
look of a pill. But one of the things we 
found out from some of these drugs 
that have come from other countries 
through Canada is that they don’t 
work. If you grind them up, they have 
exactly the same chemicals in them, 
but it isn’t just the chemicals that do 
it, it is the way they are put together 
that makes it possible for them to 
solve a medical problem. If they are 
put together wrong, they may not even 
digest. If they don’t digest, similar to a 
fingernail, you don’t get the benefit 
from the drug. If you don’t get the benefit 
from the drug, you shouldn’t pay 
anything for it. In fact, there ought to 
be some pretty severe action taken 
against the person or country or company 
that produced that kind of a drug. 
We are not able to do that. 

The Food and Drug Administration is 
charged with watching our borders and 
the things that come in to see if the 
drugs that come into this country are 
legitimate. There are warehouses full 
of drugs they have found that are not 
legitimate. So it is a matter of safety, 
and we are concentrating on the safety 
portion of this bill. So I am hoping we 
will save the drug importation question 
for a separate debate of its own. 

We know each one of us takes a risk 
every time we take a drug, but Americans 
who buy prescription drugs in 
Canada and other countries or purchase 
drugs from Internet pharmacies 


S5328 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

that operate outside the United States 
are taking an even greater risk by obtaining 
their prescription medicine 
from pharmacies and Internet sites 
that don’t always meet the high standards 
we require here at home. Here is 
where my concern lies. We already 
have a problem with counterfeit and 
substandard drugs in the United 
States. Concern about the quickly 
growing counterfeit market is not limited 
to the United States. In Europe, 
dangerous counterfeit drugs are already 
a problem, and the problem is 
growing as the European Union expands. 
In addition, we have little 
knowledge of the extent of counterfeiting 
in Asian markets such as India, 
Pakistan, and China, other than that it 
may be the best. 

Now, prior to legalizing an untested, 
drug importation project on a large 
scale across our Nation, we must consider 
any new vulnerabilities in our 
drug distribution system, especially 
since those vulnerabilities could be 
massive in size. I know we all share the 
same goals. We want to ensure that 
drugs are safe, effective, and will not 
compromise the integrity of our Nation’s 
prescription drug supply or our 
world-leading pharmaceutical research, 
and we want it to be at the lowest possible 
cost. Similar to many Americans, 
I am concerned about the high and rising 
cost of prescription drugs. However, 
I doubt the importation of drugs 
from other countries will solve that 
problem all by itself. We better be certain 
about exactly what we are doing 
and how we are going to do it. We have 
had some hearings on that. We have 
also gotten some phone calls from the 
Canadian Minister in charge of the program 
who has said: Do you realize that 
if America suddenly started buying its 
drugs from Canada, we would have to 
prohibit Americans from doing it. We 
are a small country. We could not take 
the amount of orders we might possibly 
get because we do have price fixing. 

We talk about negotiated prices and 
we talk about that in the context of 
Medicare drugs. Congress passed and 
the President implemented Medicare 
Part D that actually came in considerably 
lower in cost for drugs for American 
seniors than what we or the Government 
Accountability Office had 
ever anticipated—dramatically lower. 
Why? Because of competition. How 
does a country negotiate drug prices? 
Well, the way Canada did it was they 
said: If there are five drugs that treat 
heart problems, we make a bid for one 
drug against another drug. If there are 
five heart drugs, they all don’t do the 
same thing. Some doctors would prescribe 
one and others would prescribe 
another. But if you are going to negotiate 
prices, you make the five bid 
against each other and you pick one or 
two, and you tell the rest of them they 
can’t sell their drugs there, that the 
Government would not have any part 
of it. This eliminates choices. 

Then there is another little caveat 
that some of the countries add to that 

which says: If you don’t come in with a 
low enough price, we are going to give 
your patent away and you would not 
get anything for it. We have some real 
patent issues if we are going to have 
people investing in the research to get 
new drugs passed and approved, and we 
should take a little look at the process 
that you have to go through to get a 
drug approved. It is about a $1 billion 
project to get a drug approved. They 
don’t do that because they are wanting 
to donate $1 billion; they are doing it 
because they expect there will be some 
profit on the other end of selling the 
drug. Otherwise they wouldn’t go 
through all that research, all the trouble, 
all the clinical trials, and then 
turn it over to people for free. They 
give away quite a few drugs, but that is 
to people who can’t afford them. There 
is a lot to the fact that we have more 
pharmaceutical companies developing 
more drugs than anywhere else. I am 
pleased that through our committee we 
found out there are over 650 clinical 
trials happening right now on various 
cancer drugs. That is just in the area of 
cancer: 650 drugs in the pipeline. That 
is a lot of billions of dollars being spent 
for us. 

Every once in awhile somebody mentions 
the high cost of insurance. That 
is something else our committee is 
working on. I think we have some potential 
for making some good changes 
there. But one thing I always remind 
people of is I could get them 1980 insurance 
prices if they would settle for 1980 
treatments. Then they start to realize 
how many things that have been invented 
since 1980 that make a difference 
in our life and in our longevity. 
I don’t know of anybody who wants to 
settle for pre-1980 treatments, but they 
are cheaper. 

In any importation discussion, it is 
critical we limit imported drugs only 
to those that have been approved by 
the FDA. It is important to understand 
how small differences between drugs 
can mean big differences in patient 
health. We are talking about a drug 
safety bill on the Senate floor this 
week. We all acknowledge that there 
are drug safety problems that must be 
addressed. It makes no sense to open 
up our borders when we don’t have 
things quite right here at home. Imagine 
trying to handle the world’s drug 
safety when we are having some problems 
handling drug safety in the 
United States. Furthermore, we should 
not tell companies with whom we must 
do business how much they have to sell 
and at what price they have to sell it. 
Those are mandates I strongly believe 
will ultimately limit consumer access 
to drugs. 

So I look forward to a spirited discussion. 
I think it will answer some of my 
questions about the legislation and will 
hopefully inform us all on the best direction 
we can take from here. There 
are possibilities for solutions on drug 
importation. I hope it will be a separate 
discussion from how the Food and 
Drug Administration administers the 

safety of pharmaceuticals and medical 
devices and particularly when they 
concern children. We actually forced 
the pharmaceutical companies and the 
medical device companies to pay to 
have their products tested and reviewed. 
That is what a big portion of 
this bill is about: how they will pay for 
having the products tested and reviewed. 


That needs to be reauthorized before 
September, or it expires. That would 
mean a lot of additional costs on the 
taxpayer if we don’t do those two parts. 

There is also a portion on that which 
deals with pharmaceuticals for children. 
It is important that tests be done 
with the pharmaceuticals to be sure 
they are safe for children and in what 
dosage they are safe for children. There 
is a portion of the bill which gives incentives 
to companies that will go to 
that extra length to see which of the 
drugs can be used for children as well. 
That is another potential for a fascinating 
discussion over the next couple 
of days. 

I compliment the Members who have 
been working on that. Many are on the 
HELP Committee and have been looking 
into this with as much depth and 
detail as I have seen on any bill we 
have ever done. I have also seen as 
much cooperation between both sides 
of the aisle as I have seen on any bill 
we have done—working together to 
find a way to take care of the concerns 
and make sure we are improving the 
safety but also making it possible for 
people to get the pharmaceuticals and 
get them as quickly as possible. It 
doesn’t do any good to have a miracle 
drug and not be able to get it on the 
market. It doesn’t help to have a miracle 
drug with some problems and, because 
FDA doesn’t have the tools to 
change some of those problems, they 
have to pull it off the market and take 
it away from some people who really 
rely on that drug. That is what this bill 
does essentially. 

I think in the substitute, or managers’ 
amendment, that will be coming 
out, many of the difficulties people 
have will have been worked out. People 
are working on them as we speak. That 
is why the managers’ amendment has 
not been laid down. It has been vetted 
with all Members who are interested 
and working on this, and there has 
been incredible cooperation. I hope 
people will continue to work with us. 

I do not want anybody to think this 
bill is a complete answer to safety. It 
doesn’t cover some topics. That is because 
we are still working on some topics 
that are not developed to a point 
yet where they can be done. One is this 
drug importation. It is being looked at, 
hearings are being held, and we are trying 
to find out some way prices can be 
lowered in the United States. 

Another problem is biosimilars. 
There is a whole new area of drugs that 
has come out because the genome has 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5329 

been unlocked and proteins can be developed 
which can be used as medication 
which will solve some of those genetic 
problems. Those are called biologics. 
There are people who would like 
them to become generics right away 
because that would bring the cost 
down. Again, we want to make sure we 
have a bill that takes care of the safety 
of the biosimilars, to be sure they truly 
are similar and will have the same effect. 
The Europeans have been working 
on that for a while. We have looked at 
their model and a number of Sen-
ators—again from both sides of the 
aisle—have been working on that problem. 
Senator CLINTON and Senator 
HATCH have been very involved in that, 
providing guidance from both sides of 
the aisle. We appreciate their efforts 
on it. I do not expect that to be a part 
of this bill. 

There are a number of tobacco issues, 
and our committee has a lot of concern 
on that. There are some bills which 
would provide a different way of doing 
that—maybe put the regulation of tobacco 
under the jurisdiction of the 
FDA. I hope that will not be a part of 
this bill. That is not ready yet, either. 
We have a lot of parts that are ready, 
and particularly the user fees need to 
be done before a deadline that is coming 
up. 

I really appreciate the cooperation 
we are having in making sure we can 
meet the deadline and have an FDA 
that is even more responsive and has 
more tools in their toolbox to make 
sure the drugs out there are safe and 
that there is a system for making sure 
safety is maintained and if there is a 
problem, that it can be corrected with 
some of the new tools in the toolbox. 

I thank everybody for their cooperation 
and patience. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
CASEY). The Senator from Idaho is recognized. 


Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I may speak 
for 10 minutes as in morning business. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

ENERGY 

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am on 
the floor, as others have been today, to 
speak to an issue that I think is appropriate 
for this day and time. I say so 
for a variety of reasons but most importantly 
because it is May 1. 

Let me put it this way, because I 
think it sets the context in which I 
would like to speak for a few moments. 

Mayday, Mayday, Mayday—do you 
hear me calling? Do you hear the frustration 
of the American consumer 
today who goes to the gas pump and 
pays record-high gas prices? I saw 
prices in my State of Idaho today 
verging on an alltime high—$3.32, $3.35, 
depending how far you are from the 
head of the pipeline. 

Mayday, America. Mayday. The year 
1923 is when that term first came into 
use by Frederick ‘‘Big John’’ Mockford 
in an airport in London, speaking in 

the French term. What he was saying 
was: Help me, help me, help me. 

I do believe that is what the American 
consumer is saying today—help 
me. And to the Congress of the United 
States and to this Senate, that sound 
ought to be echoing through this 
Chamber and certainly through the 
halls and the committee rooms that 
deal with national energy policy. 

We are where we are today for absence 
of policy and for some policy 
that has driven us to less production 
and becoming increasingly more reliant 
upon someone else to produce our 
energy for us. It is in that context of a 
Mayday appeal that I speak for a few 
moments during this noon hour. 

Here is what the chart shows us very 
clearly. From 1890 to 2030, these are the 
trend lines. In 1950, we crossed a unique 
point when we began to see our demand 
outstrip our supply, and this now—well 
over 50 percent of our consumption—is 
being picked up by other countries in 
the world that are, in many instances, 
less friendly to us than we would like. 

What is happening on May Day—this 
May Day—to a major supplier to the 
south of us, a guy by the name of Hugo 
Chavez in Venezuela is privatizing 
today all of the oil fields where our 
companies produce. He is bringing 
them into his control, into his form of 
petronationalism, and he is saying the 
priority for Venezuelan oil today is not 
going to be to the United States, it is 
going to be to Cuba, Bolivia, Nicaragua, 
and Haiti. He is going to become 
their supplier first. He is also going to 
leave the World Bank and create the 
Bank of the South. He is one of our 
major suppliers, and he is less than 
friendly. 

Shouldn’t we be speaking out on May 
Day, as he speaks out toward energy 
independence, toward a greater sense of 
our own responsibility toward our own 
consumer? What is Fidel saying today? 
He didn’t make the parade, apparently, 
but he sent a letter. He is talking 
about biofuels and saying that America 
is shifting toward biofuels and they are 
going to consume all of the food supply 
of the hemisphere to produce energy. I 
find that a bit of a uniqueness. Obviously, 
while he produces some oil, he 
ships it off to have it refined, and Hugo 
Chavez and he are deciding that Venezuela 
will be the largest supplier. 

There are a few of us in Congress who 
read those signals, those senses of 
emergency, that cry for the ‘‘help me’’ 
that I think the American consumer is 
speaking out to today. Our committees 
are working their will at this moment 
to add to the National Energy Policy 
Act of 2005, which will continue to push 
the renaissance of energy production in 
this country in all forms, not just for 
hydrocarbons but electricity and other 
forms, in a way that will increasingly 
make us independent and self-reliant. 

Senator BYRON DORGAN and I introduced 
the Safe Energy Act of 2007 a 
month or so ago, which strikes at the 
heart of the combination of efforts that 
will move us further down the road to


ward accomplishing self-help, self-reliance, 
and energy independence. In that 
act, we said conservation would be a 
part of it, as it should be. I, for the 
first time, stepped out and said that I 
would accept mandatory CAFE standards 
on a growth rate of 4 percent a 
year to drive the auto industry into 
greater senses of efficiency and lead us 
toward greater levels of conservation. 
That was title I of the SAFE Act which 
we think the Commerce Committee 
will mark up in the next week. 

We spoke to innovation and innovation 
in the advance of biofuels and the 
importance of doing that and that we 
really ought to strive toward the 30 billion 
gallons, which our President spoke 
to in the State of the Union, by 2020— 
15 of that being picked up by corn but 
more importantly, now, 15 billion gallons 
being picked up by cellulosic energy—
and advancing that as rapidly as 
we can and getting the loan guarantees 
out and the grants that will take it out 
of the lab and cause it to be a standup 
commercial refinery using straw, corn 
stover, and all of those types of things 
which are the production that we think 
ought to go on in the cellulosic area. 
That is title II of the bill. We think 
that will be marked up tomorrow in 
the Energy Committee. 

But the one that hasn’t yet been 
marked up and the one I wish to spend 
a little time on today is the area of 
continued production of hydrocarbons 
in the Outer Continental Shelf. I have 
called this in the past the ‘‘no zone’’ 
speech. Let me combine that with Mayday. 
While we are saying no, our consumers 
are saying: Help me, help me, 
because I am spending more of my discretionary 
income on consumables and 
in the form of energy at a rate and 
level I never had to before. It is causing 
the American economy to shift significantly. 


Here are a variety of things we have 
done over the years that have shaped 
the Outer Continental Shelf capability. 
These areas which are pointed out on 
this map are known reserves of oil. 
Yet, because of attitudes at the State 
level, environmental concerns and frustrations, 
much of that production or 
the ability to explore within those 
fields has simply been taken off limits. 
They became the ‘‘no zone,’’ even after 
technology clearly proved that you can 
go into these waters, produce there 
safely, protect the ecosystems involved, 
and reward the American consumer 
by less dependence upon foreign 
oil and reserves. 

This area here, this small area, was a 
sale and an area we were able to put 
through just in the beginning of this 
year. This, of course, is the area in the 
gulf that is being heavily drilled today. 
These are the off-limits areas. 

I came to the floor some time ago 
and spoke of what is going on in Cuba, 
and I said that was an unacceptable 
thing and we ought to do something 
about it. So in the legislation we are 
talking about, for greater flexibility 


S5330 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

and opportunity in the Outer Continental 
Shelf, what we are really talking 
about in the SAFE Act—that last 
title yet to be introduced—that really 
balances conservation with new 
biofuels and increased production in 
this area, better known as the northern 
Cuban basin. It is an area that is off 
limits to our producers, and Cuba is 
now moving to produce it. They are 
going to do so by reaching out to other 
countries—other than ours because we 
have a prohibition on our companies 
doing business there—and they are 
looking at the French, Spaniards, the 
Chinese, and others to come and drill. 

Here is my frustration: While we are 
saying no, all around our coastlines, 
just 45 miles off our coastline, the Cubans 
have let leases for the purpose of 
drilling. 

I was in Cuba a few years ago visiting 
with their Interior Minister, and he 
said: We want your companies here. 
Why? Because you have the best technology. 
You are environmentally proven. 
You place this valuable ecosystem 
at less risk. That we know. But our 
policy today denies us that. 

There is an interesting little anomaly 
that happened—and I praise the 
new Secretary of the Interior for doing 
what he did—and that was opening, 
right off the coast of Virginia, an opportunity 
to seek natural gas and to 
see if those reserves are out there, 
which I think will drive increased production. 


So today I come to the floor on May 
Day saying: Mayday, America, Mayday, 
because Americans as they go to 
the gas pump are saying: Help us, help 
me; change the way this is happening. 
America, we have a great opportunity 
to move ourselves toward energy independence, 
less dependence on those unstable 
areas of the world where we now 
seek well over 50 percent of our hydrocarbon 
oil base. Shame on us. That is 
bad policy, and we have the power to 
change it if we have the will to change 
it. The will comes from the ability to 
build a complete portfolio of conservation, 
new technologies, and current 
production in areas where we know our 
reserves are, by building them up during 
this period of transition as our 
country moves to new technologies. 

This is a great opportunity. The only 
reason we are not doing it is because of 
resistance right here in the Congress of 
the United States, in part, put on by 
pressure from some special interests. 
But my guess is that if we listen closely 
to the American consumer today, 
they would agree that the SAFE Act 
and all titles of the SAFE Act ought to 
become public policy and that America 
clearly ought to be articulating a policy 
of greater energy independence so 
that next May Day, we can say: We 
heard you call out for help, and we are 
answering that call. Mayday, America, 
Mayday. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Texas. 

Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to follow the Senator from 

Idaho who is talking about an issue 
that is so important for our country. It 
is a wake-up call. Amazingly it is on 
May Day. I think that is the appropriate 
moniker for what we are facing 
in this country because of what is happening 
today. 

Mr. President, I wish to talk about 
what I see happening in Venezuela and 
what I think America should be doing 
to make sure we maintain the capability 
to control our national security 
and our economic security. 

Today, President Hugo Chavez is 
completing his latest and most ominous 
scheme out of the Fidel Castro 
playbook. He is nationalizing multibillion-
dollar, heavy oilfields in the Orinoco 
Belt. This energy-rich region 
southeast of Caracas has so much energy 
potential that some experts claim 
it could give the country more oil reserves 
than Saudi Arabia. 

By seizing the Orinoco Belt, President 
Chavez is consolidating his political 
power within Venezuela and increasing 
his ability to manipulate 
global oil markets. 

This nation now accounts for 14 percent 
of America’s oil imports, and Mr. 
Chavez has promised to use his ‘‘strong 
oil card’’ to, in his words, ‘‘finish off 
the U.S. empire,’’ even if that means 
colluding with some of the most nefarious 
regimes on Earth. 

Similar to Fidel Castro, who 
partnered with the Soviet Union during 
the Cold War, President Chavez is making 
common cause with America’s enemies, 
including the world’s largest 
state sponsor of terrorism, the Government 
of Iran. 

Earlier this year, he met with Iranian 
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
and made plans for a $2 billion joint 
fund, part of which will be used as a 
‘‘mechanism for liberation’’ against 
American allies. 

President Chavez hopes that the profits 
from the Orinoco Belt will flood his 
coffers for other foreign adventures. 
But by asserting government control 
over this coveted region, he is actually 
killing the golden goose that feeds his 
socialist-inspired revolution. 

President Chavez’s national oil company 
has already shown signs of stress. 
Despite record oil prices that should be 
a boon for the industry, the state-run 
company has been forced to accumulate 
a rapid increase in debt to pay for 
a doubling of ‘‘social development 
spending.’’ Meanwhile, its spending on 
energy exploration and production 
badly trails its global peers. 

In addition, the Orinoco Belt pronouncement 
has made ExxonMobil, 
Conoco Phillips, and other energy companies 
extremely cautious about putting 
their employees and billions of 
dollars in assets under Venezuelan 
management, and for good reason. 

If those American corporations decide 
to withhold their expertise and investment, 
it could further weaken the 
Chavez Government’s pursuit of socialist 
dreams and redistribution of 
wealth. ‘‘It seems as if they are going 

to strangle themselves with their own 
rope,’’ said a foreign oil analyst who 
chose not to be identified for fear of retaliation. 


President Chavez’s gross mismanagement 
of the economy should be no surprise 
to anyone who has followed the 
career of his Cuban mentor, Fidel Castro. 
In less than half a century, Fidel 
Castro has turned what was once the 
third richest nation in Latin America 
into one of the poorest nations in the 
world, a real-life prison for 11 million 
people who rely on remittances from 
abroad to avoid starvation and collapse. 


If President Chavez continues to 
adopt the Castro economic model, the 
greatest victims will be the Venezuelan 
people, but America will also suffer. 
That is because the deterioration of 
Venezuela’s oil industry could spark a 
surge in oil prices for American consumers, 
and we all know that prices 
have already jumped in the last 30 
days. Anyone who has filled a gasoline 
tank knows this would be a huge hit on 
the American economy. In fact, some 
economists say every time oil prices 
rise by 10 percent, an average of 150,000 
Americans lose their jobs because it 
presses the economy. Margins are narrowed, 
and that means people are laid 
off. 

So what should our response be? 
America must recharge its efforts to 
adopt a comprehensive plan for American 
energy independence, including 
more exploration for oil and gas at 
home. It should be a comprehensive 
plan that includes conservation, renewable 
energy, new research for new 
forms of energy that we have not yet 
explored, and it should include more 
exploration and drilling for our own resources 
which we can be assured of controlling. 


I wrote an editorial in one of the December 
issues of the Houston Chronicle 
that said we should be looking to the 
Outer Continental Shelf of the United 
States, the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and 
even the Virginia shores and other 
shores on the Pacific and Atlantic 
sides. 

Using the comprehensive energy legislation 
we passed last year, I was very 
pleased to see the announcement yesterday 
by the Department of the Interior 
that we would, in fact, increase 
production of the natural resources in 
this country. The Secretary, Dirk 
Kempthorne, who was once a Member 
of this body, announced that there 
would be 21 lease sales in eight planning 
areas which could produce 10 billion 
barrels of oil and 45 trillion cubic 
feet of natural gas over 40 years. That 
would generate about $170 billion in today’s 
dollars. 

The potential for this amount of oil 
exploration alone is equivalent to 20 
years’ worth of what we import from 
Saudi Arabia or Venezuela. 

They are doing exactly what Congress 
has authorized them to do—looking 
in the Outer Continental Shelf. 
Even the Commonwealth of Virginia is 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5331 

positive about this move because there 
are now incentives for States to allow 
production in the waters they control. 
This is one part of what we must do as 
part of a comprehensive approach to 
energy independence. 

We also need to increase research 
into alternative fuels, such as solar and 
wind power. In March, I introduced legislation 
called the CREST Act, which 
provides a comprehensive, coordinated 
national research effort that would 
spur the development of renewable energy 
for the marketplace. The oceans 
and the Gulf of Mexico have potential 
for energy production and electricity 
production. Just as we have seen wind 
energy become a factor on land, it can 
also be a factor in our bodies of water. 

We have the resources to achieve energy 
independence—the resources underneath 
our land and water—and the 
best resource of all, the ingenuity of 
our free, creative minds. Now we need 
the willpower to use it. 

President Chavez’s announcement 
today is a tremendous challenge to 
America’s energy future, but if we 
choose to be proactive, as we’ve always 
been throughout our history, we can 
regain control of our energy resources, 
and be the strongest Nation on Earth. 

We can write our own history, and 
today is the wake-up call that assures 
we must do it. 

I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The assistant legislative clerk proceeded 
to call the roll. 

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I understand 
the Senate has been scheduled 
to recess at 12:30. First, I thank the 
Presiding Officer for waiting for me 
here. As always he is gracious and 
kind. 

I now ask unanimous consent that I 
be permitted to speak for 5 minutes 
and that following my statement, the 
Senate stand in recess under the previous 
order. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS 

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join so many of my colleagues, 
so many of those in the military 
and so many of the American people 
in urging the President to sign the 
emergency spending bill that relates to 
Iraq when it reaches his desk. Despite 
what the President keeps repeating, we 
can do both—we can fund the troops 
and change our mission in Iraq. The 
emergency spending bill we will send 
to the President shortly gives our 
troops all the money they need and 
even more than the President requested, 
and it changes our mission in 
Iraq from policing a civil war to focusing 
on counterterrorism. 

It has been 4 long years since President 
Bush landed on the USS Abraham 

Lincoln and prematurely announced 
‘‘mission accomplished’’ in Iraq. 
Today, 4 years later, there is one thing 
on which the American people, bipartisan 
majorities in both Houses of Congress, 
military experts, and the Iraq 
Study Group all agree: We clearly have 
not accomplished our mission in Iraq, 
and the only way to succeed is to 
change our current course of action. 

It seems only the President and his 
small band of advisers think we have 
accomplished our mission in Iraq. Only 
he thinks we should stay the course. 
Only President Bush seems to think 
the only way to support our troops is 
for the Congress to be a rubberstamp to 
his policies. That is not what the 
American people want, and that is not 
what America is about. The American 
people want a change in mission. They 
want a new direction, not more of the 
same failed policies. That is why, if the 
President really supports our brave 
men and women fighting in Afghanistan 
and Iraq, he will sign the legislation 
that we will send to him very 
soon. 

The bill provides reasonable and 
meaningful guidelines to protect our 
troops by ensuring that all units that 
are sent overseas to fight are ready, 
trained, and equipped to fight. It will 
require the Department of Defense to 
adhere to its own guidelines to ensure 
that every unit that is deployed is 
‘‘fully mission capable’’ for the task at 
hand. 

Why would the President want to 
send our troops into Afghanistan and 
Iraq, into fierce battles against the 
Taliban and the Sunni insurgency 
without the training and equipment 
needed to get the job done and to come 
home safely? But if the President vetoes 
this bill, he will not be so required. 


More important, this legislation 
shows both the United States and the 
Government of Iraq how to change the 
failing strategy in Iraq. It has been 
clear all along that this administration 
has failed to plan for the war. They 
gave no thought what it would take to 
accomplish this mission. There was no 
planning for the day after. 

When you think about this, it is infuriating; 
to think that just showing 
strength alone would solve the whole 
problem. That kind of careless, narrow 
thinking has led us to where we are 
now. 

This administration and its President 
seem to be lost in Iraq. They can 
only do more of the same. We put in 
more troops to support a government 
that every day gets weaker and weaker, 
that seems to be crumbling from 
both the Shiite and Sunni side. Why 
are we putting more troops in Iraq to 
defend a government that nobody 
seems to like and in whom nobody 
seems to have much faith? The escalation 
is not working. 

As a result, our mission in Iraq has 
devolved so that most of what we do is 
patrol, police, and stand in the middle 
of a civil war. The Sunnis and the Shi


ites have hated each other for centuries. 
Their enmity goes way back. 
They will continue to hate each other, 
to not work with each other, to fight 
with each other long after we have 
gone, whether we stay 3 months or 3 
years. Yet most of the time our troops, 
our brave men and women, are simply 
caught in the middle of a civil war, and 
we have not even chosen a side. We are 
just in the middle, and they are just in 
the middle—trying to defend themselves 
in the middle of a civil war when 
we don’t know which side we are on, 
and we are unable to bring the two 
sides together. It is a debacle. 

That is why the Congress is demanding 
that the President change the current 
mission in Iraq. As we all know, 
including General Petraeus, the solution 
to violence in Iraq is ultimately 
political and not military, and that is 
why Congress has imposed tough 
benchmarks on the Government of 
Iraq. We cannot afford to send more 
military troops without doing something 
to change this weak, almost 
feckless Government. Our original purpose 
in Iraq was to fight terrorism. I 
believe we must continue to fight terrorism; 
I know that from what happened 
to my city, my beloved city, and 
the friends I lost and think of every 
day. 

This legislation says let’s go back to 
that original purpose, counterterrorism, 
as well as force protection and 
training the Iraqis. Instead of policing 
a civil war, U.S. forces will protect 

U.S. facilities and citizens, including 
members of the U.S. Armed Forces engaged 
in targeted counterterrorism 
missions to prevent anything that happens 
in Iraq from hurting us at home 
and continue to train and equip Iraqi 
security forces, although I must say 
that has not worked out very well thus 
far. 
I believe these benchmarks are reasonable 
and achievable with renewed 
political will from this administration 
and from the Government in Iraq. The 
benchmarks were not just pulled out of 
the air. They were suggested by the bipartisan, 
highly qualified, highly 
knowledgeable, highly experienced 
Baker-Hamilton commission. But more 
important, they signify the changes in 
strategy that must be implemented to 
correct the administration’s failing 
strategy in Iraq. 

This is President Bush’s war, but he 
has failed time and time again to make 
the difficult leadership decisions that 
are needed to protect our troops in 
Iraq. If he vetoes this bill, as he has 
threatened to do on many occasions, 
our brave men and women will continue 
to fight a brutal war with no for-
ward-look strategy, no long-term plan, 
little regional support, and little 
chance of establishing a stable, representative 
government in Iraq. Every 
day it becomes more clear the President 
never had a working plan for Iraq. 

So we have a mission. It is a sacred 
and important mission. We must 
change the mission in Iraq away from 


S5332 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

policing a civil war and toward counterterrorism, 
which requires fewer 
troops and gets many more of them out 
of harm’s way. That is what our bill 
does. It is what the American people 
want. It is what the facts on the 
ground demand. 

I urge the President to strongly reconsider 
this threat to veto this legislation. 
If he does, he will be making a 
terrible mistake, one that all of us and 
maybe even he will come to regret. I 
urge the President to sign the supplemental 
because it gives our troops and 
veterans the resources they need. It 
honors the sacrifices of those serving 
in Iraq with a change in mission that is 
long overdue, and it is my hope that 
one day we will all be able to say that 
we have accomplished our mission in 
Iraq. But until we change our mission 
and put in place a winning strategy, 
that day will continue to elude us. 

I yield the floor.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE 

AMENDMENTS OF 2007—Continued 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Oklahoma is recognized. 

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on the 
bill under consideration at the present 
time, it is my intention to—and I have 
already placed at the desk two amendments, 
987 and 988. 

Briefly, what is the order right now? 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
is recognized. The Senator has as 
much time as he may consume. 

Mr. INHOFE. Today I have submitted 
amendments to S. 1082 requiring parental 
consent for intrusive physical 
exams administered under the Head 
Start Program. Young children attending 
Head Start Programs should not be 
subjected to these intrusive types of 
physical exams. We had an incident in 
my town of Tulsa, OK, where we felt 
that their rights, children’s rights, 
were violated. They were subjected to 
different types of intrusive examinations. 
I will be bringing this up at an 
appropriate time. 

Secondly, briefly, as I see the manager 
of the bill is here, we will be introducing 
an amendment No. 988, having 
to do with protecting children from 
parents being coerced into administering 
a controlled substance or psychotropic 
drug in order to attend 
school. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to withdraw my 
amendments, No. 988 and No. 987, with 
the intention to resubmit them when a 
substitute is made in a few minutes. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield 
the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Rhode Island. 

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I believe 
the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization 
Act before us today raises 
and addresses issues that are critically 
important to the public’s health and 
well-being. Congress has a historic opportunity 
to strengthen and increase 
knowledge about drug safety and effectiveness, 
bring more transparency to 
the process of drug approval and surveillance, 
as well as reassess the goals 
of the prescription drug and medical 
device user fee programs, and fortify 
and expand essential safety programs 
for children. The FDA Revitalization 
Act strikes a careful balance between 
these many important priorities and 
objectives. 

Recent serious adverse drug events 
related to several widely used drugs on 
the market underscore the urgency 
with which we should address and improve 
drug safety in this country. 
Moreover, as the population ages and 
science inevitably advances, more and 
more drugs will come to market, presenting 
potentially groundbreaking 
health benefits to the public, but simultaneously 
increasing the need for 
sophisticated mechanisms for monitoring 
and assuring drug safety. 

The FDA Revitalization Act is an opportunity 
to improve our current system 
of drug approval and drug monitoring, 
but it also adeptly anticipates 
changes in the future of prescription 
drugs and consumer safety brought 
about by advances in science and an 
ever expanding market for prescription 
drugs. 

The primary mechanism this bill 
uses to strengthen drug safety is to 
strengthen and rearticulate the FDA’s 
authority. The bill clarifies, and in 
some cases fortifies, the FDA’s authority 
with regard to drug safety. Currently, 
if the FDA detects a problem, 
or a potential problem with a drug post 
approval, they have few options beyond 
what is often referred to as the ‘‘nuclear 
option.’’ That is, pulling a drug 
from the market. While the FDA’s authority 
to pull a drug from the marketplace 
is a powerful tool, it is a blunt instrument. 
In order to prevent problems 
from spiraling into major public health 
crises, the FDA needs intermediary authority. 
The FDA’s reluctance to pull a 

drug, potentially a drug upon which 
millions of Americans depend to manage 
an illness, unless it is overwhelmingly 
certain that the action is necessary, 
is understandable. However, 
prescription drug users suffer as a result 
since the ‘‘nuclear option’’ offers a 
forceful, but ultimately limited response. 
Pulling a drug from the market 
potentially delays action and places individuals 
at major health risks in the 
interim. On the flip side, pulling a drug 
prematurely may needlessly deny patients 
important, and in some cases, 
singular, treatments for their health 
needs. This bill offers what I believe is 
a good solution to this paradox; one 
that considers input from patients 
rights organizations, industry representatives, 
and the FDA, but ultimately 
places patients at the top of the 
list. 

The risk evaluation and mitigation, 
REMS, system, the primary tool in the 
drug safety title of this bill, bolsters 
the FDA’s intermediary authority to 
require drug manufacturers to monitor 
and provide important information regarding 
their products. By so doing, 
the FDA can actively require drug 
companies to provide information 
about the medications millions of 
Americans are taking and not just passively 
request drug companies to comply. 


Most importantly, the REMS system 
focuses the FDA’s efforts and resources 
on postmarket surveillance. Increased 
drug user fees would be used to review 
REMS as well as for general drug safety 
surveillance. User fee revenue will 
increase by $50 million to fund drug 
safety activities, of which $30 million is 
authorized for the routine drug surveillance 
once they are marketed. Many of 
us would like to eliminate the need for 
industry paid user fees, but this arrangement, 
agreed on by industry and 
the FDA, offers the best workable solution 
in this strained budget environment. 


Another important objective of the 
FDA Revitalization Act is to improve 
the integrity of the agency and to enhance 
transparency on its actions. I am 
pleased that this bill improves the 
public’s access to information about 
clinical trials and, more importantly, 
the results of those trials. The bill enhances 
patient enrollment in trials by 
requiring late phase II, as well as phase 
III and phase IV clinical trials on drugs 
are registered in a publicly available 
database. This will improve the 
public’s knowledge of important and 
potentially life saving clinical studies. 
The bill also creates a publicly available 
database of the results of those 
trials. This means, for instance, that a 
parent who wishes to understand why a 
much-talked about treatment for juvenile 
diabetes failed to advance past a 
clinical trial stage can track the 
progress of a treatment using this 
database. It is important that we empower 
patients and consumers to gather 
information from primary sources so 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5333 

that they can engage in treatment decisions 
and make informed choices regarding 
their family’s health care 
needs. 

I am also pleased to see efforts to increase 
research on pediatric drug safety, 
pediatric clinical trials, and pediatric 
medical devices in title IV of the 
FDA Revitalization Act. The bill includes 
reauthorizations of the Best 
Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, 
BPCA, championed by my colleague, 
Senator DODD, which I have cosponsored, 
and the Pediatric Research Improvement 
Act, PRIA, championed by 
my colleague, Senator CLINTON, which 
have been particularly successful at increasing 
the availability of pediatric 
specific data on drug products, as well 
as greatly expanding the number of 
treatments that have been tested and 
labeled for use in pediatric populations. 
The bill also includes a new 
proposal to expand the collection and 
availability of pediatric data on medical 
devices, an area of the medical device 
market that remains seriously underdeveloped, 
and as a result places infants 
and children at risk for inferior 
or inadequate care at best, and tragic 
and needless loss of life at worst. Moreover, 
BPCA also includes a new provision 
on patent exclusivity for blockbuster 
drugs that strikes a sound compromise 
between creating an appropriate 
financial incentive for drug companies 
to conduct much needed research, 
while also providing the FDA 
with important information about pediatric 
drugs. 

Mr. President, the FDA is responsible 
for overseeing the safety of a wide 
range of products consumed by millions 
of Americans each and every day. 
We can and must ensure that this critical 
agency has the tools and resources 
it needs to perform the myriad of tasks 
under its purview. We need to get this 
right for the millions of Americans 
who rely on the FDA to approve the 
drugs that they take to treat serious 
illnesses. The FDA Revitalization Act 
creates an opportunity to improve 
science at the FDA, strengthen drug 
safety by devoting resources to 
postmarket surveillance, and ‘‘revitalize’’ 
the FDA’s authority. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor and 
suggest the absence of a quorum.

The adjustment made each fiscal year by 
this paragraph shall be added on a compounded 
basis to the sum of all adjustments 
made each fiscal year after fiscal year 2008 
under this subsection. 

‘‘(2) WORKLOAD ADJUSTMENT.— 

‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Beginning with fiscal 
year 2009, after the fee revenues established

for advisory review prior to initial 
broadcast. 

‘‘(B) DETERMINATION OF WORKLOAD ADJUSTMENT.— 


‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—The workload adjustment

shall be determined by the Secretary— 

‘‘(I) based upon the number of direct-to-
consumer television advertisements identified 
pursuant to paragraph (3)(A) for that fiscal 
year, excluding allowable previously paid 
carry over submissions; and 

‘‘(II) by multiplying the number of such 
advertisements projected for that fiscal year 

that exceeds 150 by $27,600 (adjusted each 
year beginning with fiscal year 2009 for inflation 
in accordance with paragraph (1)). 

‘‘(ii) PUBLICATION IN FEDERAL REGISTER.— 
The Secretary shall publish in the Federal 
Register, as part of the notice described in 
paragraph (1), the fee revenues and fees resulting 
from the adjustment made under this 
paragraph and the supporting methodologies.

Secretary shall, 120 days before the start of 
each fiscal year, publish a notice in the Federal 
Register requesting any person to notify 
the Secretary within 30 days of the number 
of direct-to-consumer television advertisements 
the person intends to submit for advisory 
review by the Secretary in the next fiscal 
year. Notification to the Secretary of the 
number of advertisements a person intends 
to submit for advisory review prior to initial 
broadcast shall be a legally binding commitment 
by that person to pay the annual advisory 
review fee for that number of submissions 
on or before October 1 of the fiscal year 
in which the advertisement is intended to be 
submitted. A person shall at the same time 
also notify the Secretary if such person intends 
to use a paid submission from the previous 
fiscal year under subsection 
(a)(1)(E)(i). If such person does not so notify 
the Secretary, all submissions for advisory 
review shall be subject to advisory review 
fees. 

‘‘(B) ANNUAL FEE.—The Secretary shall, 60 
days before the start of each fiscal year, establish, 
for the next fiscal year, the direct-
to-consumer television advertisement advisory 
review fee under subsection (a)(1), based 
on the revenue amounts established under 
subsection (b), the adjustments provided 
under this subsection and the number of direct-
to-consumer television advertisements 
identified pursuant to subparagraph (A), excluding 
allowable previously paid carry over 
submissions. The annual advisory review fee 
shall be established by dividing the fee revenue 
for a fiscal year (as adjusted pursuant 
to this subsection) by the number of direct-
to-consumer television advertisements identified 
pursuant to subparagraph (A), excluding 
allowable previously paid carry over submissions. 


‘‘(C) FISCAL YEAR 2008 FEE LIMIT.—Notwithstanding 
subsection (b), the fee established 
under subparagraph (B) for fiscal year 2008 
may not be more than $83,000 per submission 
for advisory review. 

‘‘(D) ANNUAL FEE LIMIT.—Notwithstanding 
subsection (b), the fee established under subparagraph 
(B) for a fiscal year after fiscal 
year 2008 may not be more than 50 percent 
more than the fee established for the prior 
fiscal year. 

‘‘(E) LIMIT.—The total amount of fees obligated 
for a fiscal year may not exceed the 
total costs for such fiscal year for the resources 
allocated for the process for the advisory 
review of prescription drug advertising. 


‘‘(d) OPERATING RESERVES.— 

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall establish 
in the Food and Drug Administration 
salaries and expenses appropriation account 
without fiscal year limitation a Direct-to-
Consumer Advisory Review Operating Reserve, 
of at least $6,250,000 in fiscal year 2008, 
to continue the Program in the event the 
fees collected in any subsequent fiscal year 
pursuant to subsection (c)(3) do not generate 
the fee revenue amount established for that 
fiscal year.

‘‘(2) FEE SETTING.—The Secretary shall establish 
the operating reserve fee under subsection 
(a)(2)(A) for each person required to 
pay the fee by multiplying the number of direct-
to-consumer television advertisements 
identified by that person pursuant to subsection 
(c)(3)(A) by the advisory review fee 
established pursuant to subsection (c)(3) for 
that fiscal year. In no case shall the operating 
reserve fee assessed be less than the 
operating reserve fee assessed if the person 
had first participated in the Program in fiscal 
year 2008. 

‘‘(3) USE OF OPERATING RESERVE.—The Secretary 
may use funds from the reserves 
under this subsection only to the extent necessary 
in any fiscal year to make up the difference 
between the fee revenue amount established 
for that fiscal year under subsection 
(b) and the amount of fees collected 
for that fiscal year pursuant to subsection 
(a), or to pay costs of ending the Program if 
it is terminated pursuant to subsection (f) or 
if it is not reauthorized after fiscal year 2012. 

‘‘(4) REFUND OF OPERATING RESERVES.— 
Within 120 days of the end of fiscal year 2012, 
or if the Program is terminated pursuant to 
subsection (f), the Secretary, after setting 
aside sufficient operating reserve amounts to 
terminate the Program, shall refund all 
amounts remaining in the operating reserve 
on a pro rata basis to each person that paid 
an operating reserve fee assessment. In no 
event shall the refund to any person exceed 
the total amount of operating reserve fees 
paid by such person pursuant to subsection 
(a)(2). 

‘‘(e) EFFECT OF FAILURE TO PAY FEES.— 
Notwithstanding any other law or regulation 
of the Secretary, a submission for advisory 
review of a direct-to-consumer television advertisement 
submitted by a person subject to 
fees under subsection (a) shall be considered 
incomplete and shall not be accepted for review 
by the Secretary until all fees owed by 
such person under this section have been 
paid. 

‘‘(f) EFFECT OF INADEQUATE FUNDING OF 
PROGRAM.— 

‘‘(1) FIRST FISCAL YEAR.—If on November 1, 
2007, or 120 days after enactment of the Prescription 
Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007, 
whichever is later, the Secretary has received 
less than $11,250,000 in advisory review 
fees and operating reserve fees combined, the 
Program shall be terminated and all collected 
fees shall be refunded. 

‘‘(2) SUBSEQUENT FISCAL YEARS.—Beginning 
in fiscal year 2009, if, on November 1 of a fiscal 
year, the combination of the operating 
reserves, annual fee revenues from that fiscal 
year, and unobligated fee revenues from 
prior fiscal years is less than $9,000,000, adjusted 
for inflation (in accordance with subsection 
(c)(1)), the Program shall be terminated, 
and the Secretary shall notify all participants, 
retain any money from the unused 
advisory review fees and the operating reserves 
needed to terminate the Program, and 
refund the remainder of the unused fees and 
operating reserves. To the extent required to 
terminate the Program, the Secretary shall 
first use unobligated advisory review fee revenues 
from prior fiscal years, then the operating 
reserves, and then unused advisory review 
fees from the relevant fiscal year. 

‘‘(g) CREDITING AND AVAILABILITY OF 
FEES.—

drug, but differs from such adverse drug experience 
because of greater severity, specificity, 
or prevalence. 

‘‘(3) REQUIRED ELEMENTS OF A RISK EVALUATION 
AND MITIGATION STRATEGY.—If a risk 
evaluation and mitigation strategy for a 
drug is required, such strategy shall include— 


‘‘(A) the labeling for the drug for use by 
health care providers as approved under subsection 
(c); 

‘‘(B) a timetable for submission of assessments 
of the strategy, that— 

‘‘(i) for a drug no active ingredient (including 
any ester or salt of the active ingredient)

ELEMENTS OF A RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION 
STRATEGY.— 

‘‘(A) RISK EVALUATION.—If a risk evaluation 
and mitigation strategy for a drug is required, 
such strategy may include 1 or more 
of the additional evaluation elements de


scribed in this paragraph, so long as the Secretary 
makes the determination required 
with respect to each additional included element. 


‘‘(B) POSTAPPROVAL STUDIES.—If the Secretary 
determines that the reports under 
subsection (k)(1) and routine active surveillance 
as available under subsection (k)(3) (including 
available complementary approaches 
under subsection (k)(3)(B)(iv)) will not be 
sufficient to— 

‘‘(i) assess a signal of a serious risk with 
use of a drug; or 

‘‘(ii) identify, based on a review of a demonstrated 
pattern of use of the drug, unexpected 
serious risks in a domestic population, 
including older people, people with 
comorbidities, pregnant women, or children, 
the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy 
for the drug may require that the applicant 
conduct an appropriate postapproval study, 
such as a prospective or retrospective observational 
study, of the drug (which shall include 
a timeframe specified by the Secretary 
for completing the study and reporting the 
results to the Secretary). 

‘‘(C) POSTAPPROVAL CLINICAL TRIALS.—If 
the Secretary determines that the reports 
under subsection (k)(1), routine active surveillance 
as available under subsection (k)(3) 
(including available complementary approaches 
under subsection (k)(3)(B)(iv)), and 
a study or studies under subparagraph (B) 
will likely be inadequate to assess a signal of 
a serious risk with use of a drug, and there 
is no effective approved application for the 
drug under subsection (j) as of the date that 
the requirement is first imposed, the risk 
evaluation and mitigation strategy for the 
drug may require that the applicant conduct 
an appropriate postapproval clinical trial of 
the drug (which shall include a timeframe 
specified by the Secretary for completing the

‘‘(5) ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL COMMUNICATION 
ELEMENTS OF A RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION 
STRATEGY.— 

‘‘(A) RISK COMMUNICATION.—If a risk evaluation 
and mitigation strategy for a drug is 
required, such strategy may include 1 or 
more of the additional communication elements 
described in this paragraph, so long as 
the Secretary makes the determination required 
with respect to each additional included 
element. 

‘‘(B) MEDGUIDE; PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT.— 
The risk evaluation and mitigation strategy 
for a drug may require that the applicant develop 
for distribution to each patient when 
the drug is dispensed either or both of the 
following: 

‘‘(i) A Medication Guide, as provided for 
under part 208 of title 21, Code of Federal 
Regulations (or any successor regulations). 

‘‘(ii) A patient package insert, if the Secretary 
determines that such insert may help 
mitigate a serious risk listed in the labeling

(such as medical monitoring by periodic laboratory 
tests); or 

‘‘(iii) disseminating information to health 
care providers through professional societies 
about any serious risks of the drug and any 
protocol to assure safe use. 

‘‘(D) PREREVIEW.— 

‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—If the Secretary determines 
that prereview of advertisements is 
necessary to ensure the inclusion of a true 
statement in such advertisements of information 
in brief summary relating to a serious 
risk listed in the labeling of a drug, or 
relating to a protocol to ensure the safe use 
described in the labeling of the drug, the risk 
evaluation and mitigation strategy for the 
drug may require that the applicant submit 
to the Secretary advertisements of the drug 
for prereview not later than 45 days before 
dissemination of the advertisement 

‘‘(ii) SPECIFICATION OF ADVERTISEMENTS.— 
The Secretary may specify the advertisements 
required to be submitted under clause 
(i). 

‘‘(E) SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES.— 

‘‘(i) SERIOUS RISK; SAFETY PROTOCOL.—If 
the Secretary determines that advertisements 
lacking a specific disclosure about a 
serious risk listed in the labeling of a drug or 
about a protocol to ensure safe use described 
in the labeling of the drug would be false or 
misleading, the risk evaluation and mitigation 
strategy for the drug may require that 
the applicant include in advertisements of 
the drug such disclosure. 

‘‘(ii) DATE OF APPROVAL.—If the Secretary 
determines that advertisements lacking a 
specific disclosure of the date a drug was approved 
and notification that the existing information 
may not have identified or allowed 
for full assessment of all serious risks 
of using the drug would be false or misleading, 
the risk evaluation and mitigation 
strategy for the drug may require that the 
applicant include in advertisements of the 
drug such disclosure 

‘‘(iii) SPECIFICATION OF ADVERTISEMENTS.— 
The Secretary may specify the advertisements 
required to include a specific disclosure 
under clause (i) or (ii). 

‘‘(F) TEMPORARY MORATORIUM.— 

‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—To the extent consistent 
with the Constitution, the risk evaluation 
and mitigation strategy for a drug may require 
that the applicant not issue or cause to 
be issued direct-to-consumer advertisements 
of the drug for a fixed period after initial approval 
of the drug, not to exceed 2 years. 

‘‘(ii) CONDITIONS.—The Secretary may require 
the strategy for a drug to include such 
a temporary moratorium on direct-to-consumer 
advertising only if the Secretary determines 
that— 

‘‘(I) direct-to-consumer advertisements of 
the drug would be inherently misleading 
even if the disclosure under subparagraph 
(E)(ii) were required; and 

‘‘(II) other elements under this subsection 
would not be sufficient to mitigate the concern 
that clinical trials used to approve the 
drug may not have identified serious risks 
that might occur among patients expected to 
be treated with the drug. 

‘‘(iii) CONSIDERATIONS.—Before making 
such determinations, the Secretary shall 
consider— 

‘‘(I) the number of patients who may be 
treated with the drug; 

‘‘(II) the seriousness of the condition for 
which the drug will be used; and 

‘‘(III) the serious risks listed in the labeling 
of the drug. 

‘‘(iv) REQUIRED SAFETY MONITORING.—If the 
approved risk evaluation and mitigation 
strategy for a drug includes a temporary 
moratorium on direct-to-consumer advertisements 
of the drug under this subparagraph, 
the Secretary shall— 

‘‘(I) consider the concern identified under 
clause (ii)(II) with respect to such drug to be 
a priority drug safety question under subsection 
(k)(3)(B); 

‘‘(II) no less frequently than every 3 
months, evaluate the reports under subsection 
(k)(1) and the routine active surveillance 
as available under subsection (k)(3) 
with respect to such concern to determine 
whether serious risks that might occur 
among patients expected to be treated with 
the drug have been adequately identified; 
and 

‘‘(III) if such serious risks have been adequately 
identified, remove such temporary 
moratorium as an element of such strategy. 

‘‘(6) PROVIDING SAFE ACCESS FOR PATIENTS 
TO DRUGS WITH KNOWN SERIOUS RISKS THAT 
WOULD OTHERWISE BE UNAVAILABLE.— 

‘‘(A) ALLOWING SAFE ACCESS TO DRUGS WITH 
KNOWN SERIOUS RISKS.—The Secretary may 
require that the risk evaluation and mitigation 
strategy for a drug include such elements 
as are necessary to assure safe use of 
the drug, because of its inherent toxicity or 
potential harmfulness, if the Secretary determines 
that— 

‘‘(i) the drug, which has been shown to be 
effective, but is associated with a serious adverse 
drug experience, can be approved only 
if, or would be withdrawn unless, such elements 
are required as part of such strategy 
to mitigate a specific serious risk listed in 
the labeling of the drug; and 

‘‘(ii) for a drug initially approved without 
elements to assure safe use, other elements 
under paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) are not sufficient 
to mitigate such serious risk. 

‘‘(B) ASSURING ACCESS AND MINIMIZING BURDEN.—
Such elements to assure safe use under 
subparagraph (A) shall— 

‘‘(i) be commensurate with the specific serious 
risk listed in the labeling of the drug;

any element under subparagraph (A) is imposed, 
be posted publicly by the Secretary 
with an explanation of how such elements 
will mitigate the observed safety risk; 

‘‘(iii) considering such risk, not be unduly 
burdensome on patient access to the drug, 
considering in particular— 

‘‘(I) patients with serious or life-threatening 
diseases or conditions; and 

‘‘(II) patients who have difficulty accessing 
health care (such as patients in rural or 
medically underserved areas); and 

‘‘(iv) to the extent practicable, so as to 
minimize the burden on the health care delivery 
system— 

‘‘(I) conform with elements to assure safe 
use for other drugs with similar, serious 
risks; and 

‘‘(II) be designed to be compatible with established 
distribution, procurement, and dispensing 
systems for drugs. 

‘‘(C) ELEMENTS TO ASSURE SAFE USE.—The 
elements to assure safe use under subparagraph 
(A) shall include 1 or more goals to 
mitigate a specific serious risk listed in the 
labeling of the drug and, to mitigate such 
risk, may require that— 

‘‘(i) health care providers that prescribe 
the drug have particular training or experience, 
or are specially certified (which training 
or certification shall be available to any 
willing provider from a frontier area); 

‘‘(ii) pharmacies, practitioners, or health 
care settings that dispense the drug are specially 
certified (which certification shall be 
available to any willing provider from a 
frontier area); 

‘‘(iii) the drug be dispensed to patients 
only in certain health care settings, such as 
hospitals; 

‘‘(iv) the drug be dispensed to patients with 
evidence or other documentation of safe-use 
conditions, such as laboratory test results; 

‘‘(v) each patient using the drug be subject 
to certain monitoring; or

in a registry. 

‘‘(D) IMPLEMENTATION SYSTEM.—The elements 
to assure safe use under subparagraph 

(A) that are described in clauses (ii), (iii), or 
(iv) of subparagraph (C) may include a system 
through which the applicant is able to 
take reasonable steps to— 
‘‘(i) monitor and evaluate implementation 
of such elements by health care providers, 
pharmacists, and other parties in the health 
care system who are responsible for implementing 
such elements; and 

‘‘(ii) work to improve implementation of 
such elements by such persons. 

‘‘(E) EVALUATION OF ELEMENTS TO ASSURE 
SAFE USE.—The Secretary, through the Drug 
Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee 
(or successor committee) of the Food 
and Drug Administration, shall— 

‘‘(i) seek input from patients, physicians, 
pharmacists, and other health care providers 
about how elements to assure safe use under 
this paragraph for 1 or more drugs may be 
standardized so as not to be— 

‘‘(I) unduly burdensome on patient access 
to the drug; and 

‘‘(II) to the extent practicable, minimize 
the burden on the health care delivery system; 


‘‘(ii) at least annually, evaluate, for 1 or 
more drugs, the elements to assure safe use 
of such drug to assess whether the elements— 


‘‘(I) assure safe use of the drug; 

‘‘(II) are not unduly burdensome on patient 
access to the drug; and 

‘‘(III) to the extent practicable, minimize 
the burden on the health care delivery system; 
and 

‘‘(iii) considering such input and evaluations— 


‘‘(I) issue or modify agency guidance about 
how to implement the requirements of this 
paragraph; and 

‘‘(II) modify elements under this paragraph 
for 1 or more drugs as appropriate. 

‘‘(F) ADDITIONAL MECHANISMS TO ASSURE ACCESS.—
The mechanisms under section 561 to 
provide for expanded access for patients with 
serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions 
may be used to provide access for patients 
with a serious or life-threatening disease 
or condition, the treatment of which is 
not an approved use for the drug, to a drug 
that is subject to elements to assure safe use 
under this paragraph. 

‘‘(G) WAIVER IN PUBLIC HEALTH EMER-
GENCIES.—The Secretary may waive any requirement 
of this paragraph during the period 
described in section 319(a) of the Public 
Health Service Act with respect to a qualified 
countermeasure described under section 
319F-1(a)(2) of such Act, to which a requirement 
under this paragraph has been applied, 
if the Secretary has— 

‘‘(i) declared a public health emergency 
under such section 319; and 

‘‘(ii) determined that such waiver is required 
to mitigate the effects of, or reduce 
the severity of, such public health emergency. 


‘‘(7) SUBMISSION AND REVIEW OF RISK EVALUATION

‘‘(ii) With respect to inspections of the establishment

quality controls of the establishment have 
been sufficient for ensuring consistent compliance 
with current good manufacturing

manufacturing practice or other quality control

compliance by promptly correcting any compliance 
problems identified in such inspections.

a device establishment if the Secretary determines 
that the establishment has failed 
to demonstrate consistent compliance for 
purposes of subparagraph (B)(iii)(I) and the 
Secretary provides to the owner or operator 
of the establishment a statement of the reasons 
for such determination.

of the accredited person identified in 
the notice under subparagraph (A)(ii) if the

may include that the establishment 
or the accredited person, as the case may be, 
has failed to fully respond to the request, or 
that the Secretary has concerns regarding 
the relationship between the establishment 
and such accredited person. 

‘‘(II) If the Secretary rejects the selection 
of an accredited person by the owner or operator 
of a device establishment, the owner or 
operator may make an additional selection 
of an accredited person by submitting to the

that is denied clearance under clause (i) or 

(ii) or with respect to which the selection of 
the accredited person is rejected under 
clause (iii), the Secretary shall designate a 
person to review the statement of reasons, or 
statement summarizing such evidence, as 
the case may be, of the Secretary under such 
clause if, during the 30-day period beginning 
on the date on which the owner or operator 
of the establishment receives such statement, 
the owner or operator requests the review. 
The review shall commence not later 
than 30 days after the owner or operator requests 
the review, unless the Secretary and 
the owner or operator otherwise agree.’’;

Amend the title so as to read: ‘‘To amend 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
and the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize 
drug and device user fees and ensure 
the safety of medical products, and for other 
purposes.’’. 

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this 
basically incorporates a number of the 

adjustments and changes that we had 
indicated during the course of our 
markup. We had a number of amendments 
that were offered. We indicated 
to the members we would try to work 
through some of the points that were 
raised. I commend our staffs on both 
sides who have been diligent in doing 
so. 

These are alterations, changes that 
are known to the majority and the minority 
and all the staff members. Later 
on in the discussion and debate we can 
go into some in greater detail. Most of 
them are clarifications. Some of them 
are simplifications. I think all of them 
are worthy and justified, and I think 
they help to strengthen the legislation. 
So we are very grateful to all of our 
colleagues on our committee who offered 
the amendments, and, most particularly, 
we are very grateful for their 
willingness to work with us to try to 
work through these alterations and 
changes. 

Mr. President, this legislation, as 
was pointed out in the excellent statement 
made by our friend and colleague 
from Rhode Island, Mr. REED, and others, 
is complex, but it is incredibly important 
in terms of American families, 
most precisely with regard to drug 
safety. We have reviewed those provisions. 
Senator ENZI made an excellent 
presentation yesterday. We tried to go 
through those in some detail yesterday 
afternoon. I might go through some of 
those again this afternoon. 

But we want our Members to know 
we are ready to consider amendments. 
We know there are several that are just 
about ready to be offered. We urge 
those who are considering bringing 
them to the floor, let’s begin the debate 
and discussion. We have one or 
two that are still being worked on. So 
even though it does not appear like we 
are making progress on this legislation 
at the moment, progress is being made 
in making sure we are going to have 
strong FDA reauthorization legislation. 
But we do hope we can get to the 
amendments very soon, and we expect 
to be able to do so. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Wyoming. 

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise at 
this moment to support the substitute 
that has been put into S. 1082, the Food 
and Drug Administration Revitalization 
Act. I have said a lot about this 
important bill, and I do intend to say 
more. The most important thing I can 
say right now is this is the product of 
a lot of bipartisan work by members of 
the Senate Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. We have a 
great process that wound up with a 
work in progress, which wound up with 
this substitute bill. 

Now we do have one major outstanding 
issue to figure out; that is, 
the direct consumer advertising for 
prescription drugs. I do believe we will 
work something out, but we are not 
quite there yet. So I would ask my colleagues’ 
indulgence to work that out, 
and I hope I have the assurance of the 


S5362 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

chairman that we will engage in a serious 
dialog about the various provisions 
that are included in that direct consumer 
issue. That will be a real key to 
finishing up. 

I congratulate the Senator from Massachusetts, 
Mr. KENNEDY, for the outstanding 
way he and his staff have 
worked with all the Members on our 
side of the aisle to clear up. As he said, 
in some cases, clarifications were needed, 
and in some cases it was the expansion 
of wording; in some cases, a reduction 
in wording. But, at any rate, we 
got it to where I think both sides understand 
and agree on many of the 
issues that are included. I hope we can 
have other amendments brought to the 
floor so we can debate them and get 
them worked out. 

Of course, it would be nice if any 
Senator thinking about offering an 
amendment would share their idea 
with us prior to filing it. We might be 
able to save some time that way and 
make sure debate flows in an orderly 
process. We are trying to keep the bill 
to relevant amendments. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Massachusetts. 

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to continue working with my 
colleague from Kansas, Senator ROBERTS, 
and my colleague from Iowa, 
Senator HARKIN, on the important 
issue of direct-to-consumer advertising. 


We have to strike an important balance 
between seeing that consumers 
get accurate information on drug safety 
and seeing that we do not improperly 
restrain free speech. 

Senator HARKIN has a proposal to add 
safety information to drug ads. Senator 
ROBERTS has an idea to allow FDA 
to impose fines for inaccurate ads. Our 
bill includes a moratorium—only to be 
used in rare cases—on DTC ads. The 
IOM went further and recommended a 
moratorium on DTC for all new drugs. 
We rejected that recommendation due 
to the first amendment concerns but 
included more limited authority that 
we believe meets the constitutional 
test. 

Still, some have raised concerns 
about our current proposal, and we 
take those concerns seriously. We will 
continue to work on this important 
issue with our colleagues and constitutional 
experts. I think we are making 
progress through the afternoon and, 
hopefully, by tomorrow we will have 
some recommendation. 

I suggest the absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 

Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. 
MCCASKILL). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 

Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent to speak as in 
morning business and that my remarks 

be printed at the appropriate place in 
the RECORD. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

f 

IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING 

Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I come to the floor today to express my 
deep disappointment and the disappointment 
of so many people in my 
State with the President’s expected decision 
to veto the supplemental funding 
bill delivered to him by the bipartisan 
majority in Congress. This bill 
provided our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan 
with all the equipment and the 
resources they need to continue the duties 
they have been so bravely performing 
for more than 4 years. The 
amount appropriated by Congress rose 
well above the amount the President 
requested to give our soldiers on the 
battlefield. Let it be clear: Congress 
has given our soldiers on the battlefield 
all the funding they need. It is the 
President who will now be blocking it. 

A few weeks ago, I was driving in 
Minnesota. It was a beautiful spring 
day outside of Ortonville, MN, and as 
has happened too many times in my 
short time as a Senator, I called one of 
the mothers of the Minnesota soldiers 
who died in this war. Of the 22,000 
troops the President has included in 
this surge, 3,000 of them are Minnesota 
Guard and Reserves who were expected 
to come home in January and February 
and now have been extended. Now the 
moms I am calling are the moms of 
these soldiers who would have been 
home in January or February. 

I asked this mother: How are you 
doing? 

She said: You know, people keep asking 
me that, and I don’t really know 
what to say. Do you have any ideas 
about what I should say? 

I thought, and I told her: Well, I can 
tell you what all the other mothers 
have been saying. They have been saying 
that they wake up every morning 
and they try hard to hang together for 
their family, and then something happens. 
They see a picture or they remember 
something, and they are never 
the same for the rest of the day. They 
have their good moments, but their 
lives will never be the same. 

I told her that her son stood tall, and 
that now is the time for people in 
Washington to stand tall. 

After 4 years of extensive American 
military involvement in Iraq, the 
President refuses to accept the prudent 
change of course recommended by the 
bipartisan Iraq Study Group and supported 
by a clear majority of the American 
people. By passing this bill, we in 
Congress fulfilled our constitutional 
duties to, first, continue funding for 
America’s Armed Forces in harm’s way 
and, second, to ensure that our Government 
pursues policies in the best interests 
of our soldiers and of our Nation. 

As we work with the President in the 
days and weeks and months to come, 
we must continue to advocate for the 

necessary changes in our strategy in 
Iraq. It is with this spirit that we in 
Congress continue to reach out to the 
President for a responsible change of 
course in Iraq. 

Last month, I visited Baghdad and 
Fallujah. I saw firsthand the bravery 
and commitment of our troops. The 
very best thing we can do for these 
young men and women is not only give 
them the equipment they deserve but 
to get this policy right. This means 
sending a clear message to the Iraqi 
Government that we are not staying 
there indefinitely. This means, as recommended 
by the bipartisan Iraq 
Study Group, that we begin the process 
of redeploying our troops, with the 
goal of withdrawing combat forces by 
next year, while acknowledging that 
some troops may remain to train the 
Iraqi police and special forces to provide 
security for those who remain and 
to conduct special operations. This 
means not a surge in troops but a surge 
in diplomacy and economy and Iraqi 
responsibility. 

When I was over in Baghdad and 
Fallujah, I saw many things, including 
the bravery of our troops. I was struck 
a few weeks later when another delegation 
of people from Congress went 
there, and one of the Congressmen returned 
and said he had been visiting a 
market there. He said it reminded him 
of a farmers market in Indiana. 

Those are not the enduring memories 
of my trip to Iraq. My most enduring 
memory is standing on the tarmac in 
the Baghdad Airport with nine firefighters 
from the Duluth National 
Guard, who called me over to stand 
with them while they saluted as six 
caskets draped in the American flag 
were loaded onto a plane. As every casket 
was loaded on, they saluted. They 
were standing tall for their fallen soldiers 
that day. Now is our time for 
Congress to stand tall. Our troops have 
done everything they have been asked 
to do. They have deposed an evil dictator, 
and they gave the Iraqi people 
the opportunity to vote and establish a 
new government. It is now the Iraqi 
Government’s responsibility to govern. 

But stability and progress in Iraq depend 
on the political reforms Iraqi 
leaders have promised many times yet 
failed to deliver. After 4 years, despite 
many promises, Iraq has yet to approve 
a provincial election law. After 4 years, 
despite many promises, Iraq has yet to 
approve a law to share oil revenues. 
After 4 years, despite many promises, 
Iraq has yet to approve a 
debaathification law to promote reconciliation. 
After 4 years, despite many 
promises, Iraq has yet to approve a law 
reining in the militia. Our men and 
women in uniform cannot deliver these 
kinds of reforms to Iraq. This is up to 
the Iraqis themselves. 

As the bipartisan Iraq Study Group 
recommended, Iraqi leaders must pay a 
price if they continue to fail to make 
good on key reforms they have promised 
the Iraqi people. After 4 years, 
what have we gotten? Benchmarks 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5363 

without progress, promises without results, 
claims of accountability without 
any consequences. Why should we expect 
the Iraqi leaders to do any better 
when they know the President continues 
to accept their excuses for inaction 
and fails to impose any penalties 
for their lack of progress. 

That is why the bipartisan Iraq 
Study Group made clear that ‘‘if the 
Iraqi government does not make substantial 
progress toward the achievement 
of milestones on national reconciliation, 
security, and governance, 
the United States should reduce its political, 
military, or economic support 
for the Iraqi government.’’ That report 
was issued 5 months ago. Meanwhile, 
the President has simply stayed the 
course he has continued to pursue for 
the past 4 years and, not surprisingly, 
little progress has been achieved in 
Iraq. The Iraqi Government will understand 
and finally take responsibility 
only when it is crystal clear to them 
that our combat presence is not indefinite 
and that American combat troops 
are going to leave. That is the responsible 
change of course we in Congress 
are seeking. The American people are 
looking to their leaders in Washington 
at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue 
to work together to get this policy 
right. 

Two weeks ago, I went to the White 
House and met with the President, 
along with three other Senators, including 
two Republicans. I appreciated 
the time he took to honestly discuss 
our points of agreement and disagreement 
on the war. I told him that now 
is the time to forge cooperation with 
our Democrats in Congress. But the 
President has chosen instead to veto 
this bill. 

As we move forward on the funding of 
this war, we in Congress will do nothing 
that threatens the safety of American 
soldiers in the field. But we must 
continue to fulfill our constitutional 
duty to exercise oversight of American 
policies in Iraq. A critical part of this 
oversight must be demanding accountability 
for the way in which funds are 
spent on the reconstruction projects in 
Iraq. 

For the past 4 years, the administration 
has demanded—and received—a 
blank check to spend in Iraq. Now we 
are seeing the consequences of this 
lack of planning, management, and responsibility. 


On Monday, the Special Inspector 
General for Iraq Reconstruction released 
a report that details widespread 
failures in the most basic reconstruction 
projects. The report finds that, in 
many cases, Iraq’s infrastructure and 
utility systems are worse off than they 
were before the war. 

On closer inspection, it turns out 
that even projects which were declared 
‘‘success stories’’ were considerably 
less than that. In fact, seven out of 
eight of these projects which were 
called success stories were not operating 
properly due to plumbing and 
electrical failures, improper mainte


nance, possible looting, and the fact 
that expensive equipment was available 
but never used. 

Prior to the 2003 invasion, Iraq’s 
power system produced 4,500 
megawatts a day. Today, the same system 
produces 3,832 megawatts a day. In 
Baghdad, the city enjoys an average of 

6.5 hours of electricity a day. A year 
ago, Baghdad received 8 hours of electricity 
a day. Before the war, the city 
received an average of 16 to 24 hours a 
day. 
Congress has provided $4.2 billion for 
reconstruction of Iraq’s power system, 
and the result has been a more than 50 
percent decrease in the length of time 
the citizens of Baghdad have access to 
electricity on any given day. 

Congress has provided nearly $2 billion 
to provide clean drinking water 
and repair sewer systems. But according 
to the World Health Organization, 
70 percent of Iraqis lack access to clean 
drinking water. 

The Defense Department has estimated 
that the unemployment rate in 
Iraq is anywhere between 13.6 percent 
to 60 percent. In a recent survey, only 
16 percent of Iraqis said their current 
incomes met their basic needs. 

So after 4 years, we are facing a security 
situation that continues to deteriorate, 
an economic situation that 
continues to stagnate, and a reconstruction 
effort that cannot provide 
even the most basic services. 

My colleagues and I have been asking 
the difficult questions and demanding 
answers from this administration. The 
supplemental bill demonstrates that 
Congress is reclaiming its rightful role 
in setting Iraq policy and, more broadly, 
in our system of government. The 
President’s veto only strengthens our 
resolve. 

Madam President, I also wish to 
speak briefly in support of a few other 
provisions in this bill that I believe respond 
to critical challenges our Nation 
faces and that the administration has 
deemed unnecessary. 

The White House and many of my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
have argued that this bill should not 
contain funding for anything other 
than the current war. If we were sacrificing 
funding for our troops in order to 
meet domestic priorities, I would 
agree. But having given our troops all 
they need and continuing to ignore crises 
at home would be irresponsible. 

Veterans funding is one of the key 
parts of this bill. This bill adds an increase 
in veterans funding that was 
long overdue. In the last 2 years in my 
State, veterans would come up to me— 
particularly from the Iraq and Afghanistan 
wars—and they would tell me 
about how they had difficulty getting 
treatment. They clearly had mental 
health issues. I didn’t know if there 
was truth to this. I wasn’t sure, because 
of the state of their minds, 
whether this was true. Then I got here, 
and I started looking at the numbers. 

In 2005, the Department of Defense 
estimated that about 24,000 soldiers 

coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan 
would need health care. The actual 
number is four times that amount. 
Last year, they were 87,000 soldiers 
short in their estimate of how many 
soldiers would need help coming back 
from this war. Now I know why those 
people were wandering around asking 
for help. It is because they weren’t getting 
the help they deserve. 

Another critical problem that has 
been ignored by this administration— 
and one that is particularly important 
to the people of my State—has been 
the tremendous damage recent national 
disasters have been inflicting on 
our farmers and ranchers. The supplemental 
spending bill was a combination 
of a 2-year effort to secure disaster 
assistance for America’s farmers. Minnesota 
farmers have been hit with 
heavy losses for 2 consecutive years— 
storms and flooding in 2005 and, again, 
drought in 2006. All told, they lost 
more than $700 million in crop and livestock 
losses. 

The supplemental funding would 
have provided $3.5 billion to compensate 
farmers for a portion of their 
crop and livestock losses over the past 
2 years. Our farmers have waited too 
long for this disaster relief. I am deeply 
disappointed that the President has 
turned his back on the urgent need for 
their assistance. 

The bill we sent to the President of 
the United States provided the resources 
and support our soldiers need 
on the battlefield and after they return 
home. A few months ago, I attended a 
funeral of one of the brave men who 
was killed in the line of duty. The 
priest stood up, and he said to the 
thousand people in the cathedral: You 
know, this was a good kid. He was 6 
feet 2 inches tall, but he was still our 
child. 

When we send our kids to war and 
they are 6 feet tall, they are still our 
kids and they are standing tall. We 
need to stand tall. 

The traumatic brain injury victims I 
have seen at the veterans hospital in 
Minnesota, even in their wheelchairs, 
are standing tall. 

Those moms whom I talked to on the 
phone, as they struggle every day just 
to get out of bed to deal with the loss 
of their kids who were killed in this 
war, are standing tall. 

Now it is time for the President of 

the United States to stand tall. 

Madam President, I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen


ator from Massachusetts is recognized. 

Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to proceed as in 
morning business. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

IRAQ 

Mr. KERRY. Madam President, 4 
years ago today, as we know, the President 
stood on an aircraft carrier underneath 
a banner that read ‘‘Mission Accomplished.’’ 
He declared that the 
major combat operations in Iraq were 
over. When he spoke those words, 140 


S5364 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

American troops had been killed in 
Iraq. Since then, over 3,200 more American 
troops have given their lives. Just 
today, we learned that April was the 
deadliest month this year, with 104 
Americans dead. 

With every passing day, it becomes 
more obvious that the President really 
should have said: My fellow Americans, 
major combat operations in Iraq are 
just beginning. On that day, he should 
have had a plan to match the rhetoric 
with reality. But we are where we are, 
as the saying goes, and it is even more 
tragically clear to all but a few that if 
we want to accomplish our mission in 
Iraq—and we all do—if we want an Iraq 
that has any chance of stability and 
some sense of democracy, any sense of 
it, we have to change course. 

In the past 4 years, we have lost at 
least 3,342 of our best young men and 
women, and nearly 25,000 others have 
been wounded and many wounded severely. 
We have spent nearly $400 billion, 
and the cost is rising at a rate of 
over $2 billion per week. There is no 
end in sight. 

ADM William Fallon, the top U.S. 
commander in the Middle East, recently 
said: 

We are losing ground every day. 

And even General Petraeus, the top 
commander in Iraq, now says that we 
can expect the situation to get worse 
before it gets better. 

We were treated to a spectacle a 
week and a half ago with news reports, 
a front-page story, I think, in the 
Washington Post, that Stephen Hadley, 
the President’s security adviser, was 
casting about to find a general to be 
the sort of supreme organizer, if you 
will, of the war in Afghanistan and the 
war in Iraq. 

What struck me about that story is 
here is our Nation at war, here is a series 
of four-star generals whose lives 
are committed to Nation, to service, to 
duty, and to military, who under normal 
circumstances would be honored to 
be asked to become the point person to 
organize our Nation’s efforts in two 
wars in a front that is of serious consequence 
to this Nation. Yet all four 
retired four-star generals said no. One 
was even quoted publicly as saying 
they don’t know what the hell they are 
doing, or they don’t know what direction 
they are going in. 

That is a pretty remarkable statement 
for a career military person to 
make about the current effort. But we 
also know the history of what has 
brought us here with retired generals— 
a whole host of them—who publicly rebelled 
postservice against the leadership 
of Secretary Rumsfeld, who is now 
gone. 

It is a rather remarkable statement 
about the lack of planning, about the 
lack of candor, about the scapegoating 
that has gone on, about the unwillingness 
of people’s careers to be judged 
not by their ability to tell the truth 
but, rather, their willingness to tell 
the civilian leaders what they want to 
hear. 

As we know from our own intelligence 
agencies, the war in Iraq has 
increased the threat of terrorism by 
creating a breeding ground for terrorists 
that didn’t exist before the invasion 
and by serving as a rallying point 
for extremists around the world. In 
fact, the State Department’s annual 
terrorism report released yesterday 
shows that terrorist attacks worldwide 
were up 25 percent last year after increasing 
nearly fourfold the year before 
that. 

How does the leadership come to the 
country and suggest that this war is 
accomplishing our larger goals? How 
does it help the war on terror to be creating 
more terrorists? How can you tell 
the American people we have made you 
safer, when the number of terrorist incidents 
have gone up and the number of 
terrorists who want to kill Americans 
is larger today than it was on 9/11? 

Any businessperson, any tourist, anybody 
of any curiosity who has traveled 
abroad and who has asked a few simple 
questions or read the newspapers and 
listened to the news knows that our 
Nation, which we love passionately, is 
now less followed, less listened to, and 
less feared—less listened to by our 
friends and less feared by our enemies. 
The fact is, we are less safe as a result. 
We are less unified at home, less respected 
abroad, and we are less strong 
as a result. 

Obviously, there is no way we can 
make up for what has happened in the 
last few years, certainly not in terms 
of the lives lost and the pain and suffering 
endured by those wounded and 
by families who have suffered those 
losses, but the fact is, we can find a responsible 
strategy to try to deal with 
not just Iraq but the whole Middle East 
and, indeed, releverage America’s position 
in the world. 

The President today, tonight, is 
going to veto crucial funding for the 
troops passed by both Houses of Congress, 
legislation that gives our soldiers 
all they need to complete the 
mission and receive the care they deserve 
once they get home. The President 
is going to veto it, but that is not 
all he is going to do. Then he is going 
to try to pin the blame on those who 
have pushed for a new direction. He is 
going to try to pin the blame for his 
failures, for his lack of planning, for 
his lack of leadership on those who are 
providing the only way to try to resolve 
what is happening in Iraq. 

Instead of pressuring Iraqi politicians, 
this administration is practicing 
the politics of division at home, a 
brand of American sectarianism that 
undermines our national unity, a unity 
required to make decisions in time of 
war. 

Last week, Vice President CHENEY 
accused Senator HARRY REID of putting 
politics ahead of our national security. 
I suppose we have grown used to this 
Vice President, who has pioneered the 
politics of fear, who oversaw the 
politicization of the intelligence used 
to mislead the country into war, who 

claimed that we would be greeted like 
liberators, who told us the insurgency 
was in its last throws, who continues 
to insist that everything is on track 
and growing fine, I think we have 
grown used to this Vice President not 
being candid with the American people. 

Clearly, he didn’t hesitate to impugn 
the integrity of the Senate’s majority 
leader who is standing for an appropriate 
new direction with respect to 
our policy in Iraq. 

Certainly, we can disagree about 
those tactics or strategies without impugning 
the motives and challenging 
the integrity of those who speak those 
different possibilities. 

If the President insists on continuing 
down the wrong path, it seems to me 
Congress has no choice but to be as resolute 
in demanding the right path forward 
for our troops, for our country, 
and for the Iraqis themselves. I believe 
we have to continue to fight for the 
legislation that gives us the best 
chance of bringing our troops home 
with some measure of success in the region. 


Four years after ‘‘mission accomplished,’’ 
it is time for us to acknowledge 
the implications of what General 
Petraeus and every other military 
commander, the Secretary of State and 
even the President have told us. All of 
them have said there is no military solution 
to the violence in Iraq. I don’t 
know how many times I have heard 
that on Sunday shows, I hear it out 
here in the corridors with individual 
Senators talking to the press. Everybody 
mouths the words: ‘‘There is no 
military solution.’’ But if there is no 
military solution and we are all agreed 
on that, then what is the military 
doing? Why is the military and an escalation 
in the number of troops so critical 
if there is no military solution? 

The administration, even after telling 
you there is no military solution, 
then gives you a rationale for a military 
solution, which is: We have to put 
additional troops in to have the security, 
in order to have the compromises. 
But the fact is, the security which, 
first of all, is proving illusive and probably 
impossible to secure with the 
troops alone, cannot be secured without 
the political compromises. This is 
a classic chicken-and-egg situation: 
Which comes first? You are not going 
to get the security until the stakeholders 
in this civil struggle feel confident 
enough that what they are 
struggling about can be resolved to 
their safety and future security. That 
is sort of a fundamental issue. You are 
not going to change the on-the-ground 
security situation and stop people from 
bombing and militias from killing unless 
those fundamental stakes are properly 
addressed and defined. 

It is long since time that we started 
to measure progress on the ground in 
Iraq by the one metric that will ultimately 
determine our success or our 
failure, and that metric is this: Are the 
Iraqis making the tough political compromises 
necessary to keep their country 
together? 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5365 

It has been nearly a year since the 
Maliki Government took power. At 
that time, General Casey and Ambassador 
Khalilzad said that the Maliki 
Government had 6 months to make the 
political compromises necessary to win 
the public confidence. 

So here we have the commanding 
general of our forces and our trusted 
Ambassador to Iraq both saying they 
have 6 months to make the compromises. 
But guess what. The 6 
months went by and nothing hap-
pened—nothing happened in Iraq to 
make those compromises happened, 
and nothing happened afterwards because 
the compromises didn’t happen. 
That sends a message that there is no 
consequence to delay, there is no consequence 
to procrastination. 

After that, the Iraqi Government 
agreed to a set of benchmarks because 
people were growing frustrated and 
those benchmarks, guess what, were 
pegged to specific dates for making 
progress toward national reconciliation. 


In January, the President announced 
the troop escalation, and he told the 
American people the following: 

America will hold the Iraqi Government to 
the benchmarks it has announced. Now is 
the time to act. The Prime Minister understands 
this. 

But, once again, no real consequences, 
no real leverage, no real diplomacy. 
The result is, those benchmarks 
proved meaningless. You can 
take a look at the benchmarks the 
Iraqis agreed to. What did they agree 
to do at that point in time? 

October 2006, over 6 months ago, that 
was the deadline for Iraqis to approve a 
new oil law and a provincial election 
law. As of today, the oil law has yet to 
even be introduced in Parliament, and 
that is an improvement over the provincial 
election law which hasn’t even 
been drafted yet. 

November 2006 was the deadline for 
new debaathification law to help bring 
Sunnis into the Government. A draft 
proposal was recently denounced by 
Ayatollah Sistani and a national commission 
to oversee the process, and 
guess what. It is nowhere near completion. 
In fact, 5 months after the deadline, 
the Shiite leader of the SCIRI 
Party recently described the Baathists 
as ‘‘the first enemy of the Iraqi people.’’ 
So much for debaathification and 
reconciliation. 

December 2006 was the deadline for 
the Iraqis to approve legislation to address 
the militias. To date, absolutely 
no progress has been made on this crucial 
legislation, and the militias continue 
to wreak havoc. 

January 2007 was the deadline for 
Iraqis to complete a constitutional review 
process. There was supposed to be 
a referendum on constitutional amendments 
by March. Guess what. The constitutional 
committee hasn’t even 
drafted the proposed amendments, and 
the Iraqis remain far apart on key 
issues such as federalism and the fate 
of the divided city of Kirkut. 

We are no closer to a political solution 
today than we were when the 
Maliki Government took power 1 year 
ago, but there were more than 940 additional 
American troops who gave their 
lives in that process to wait for the 
Iraqis to procrastinate. 

Did the President actually hold the 
Iraqi Government to those benchmarks 
as promised? No. I hope the President 
tonight, when he addresses us after the 
veto, will address the benchmarks and 
where we are with respect to the failure 
of the Government to make the 
choices they said they had to make 
while our soldiers continue to die. 

The administration still refuses to 
get genuinely tough with Iraqi politicians. 
They keep moving the goalposts, 
deflect the criticism of a failed strategy 
which they refuse to abandon. Instead, 
we get more vague assertions 
that our presence is not open-ended 
and outright rejection of any proposal 
that would leverage that threat. 

The administration, it seems to me, 
has reached a point where it has to 
stop pretending the lack of political 
will in America is the problem. It is 
not the lack of political will in America 
that is the problem, it is the lack of 
political will in Iraq that is the problem. 


It is impossible to make any other 
judgment when you look at that entire 
series of benchmarks. I remember Secretary 
Rice coming before the Foreign 
Relations Committee, I believe, several 
months ago now, and I asked her the 
question about the oil law. She said: 
Oh, yes, the oil law is almost done, just 
about done; wrapped up, we are about 
to proceed forward, we are confident it 
is going to be done in a few days. Here 
we are, several months later, and there 
is no oil law. It is not even before the 
Parliament yet. 

The administration needs to accept 
the basic reality that the Congress has 
acknowledged: Iraqi politicians, if they 
are capable, if they are capable of making 
these decisions, have shown they 
will not do it without a reason to do it, 
without a rationale that feels some 
heat. A deadline is the only thing they 
have responded to so far. It took a 
deadline to be able to get them to do a 
constitution. It took a deadline to have 
each of their elections. 

Incidentally, they protested against 
each of the deadlines. Each time they 
said: Don’t do this to us; we can’t meet 
it; we can’t make it; it is too much. 
But each time, because we set the 
deadline and kept pushing, they did 
meet it. 

American security is not a security 
blanket for Iraqis who want to procrastinate 
while American soldiers die. 
The longer the President continues to 
give them the sense that he is not 
going to change, he is not going to 
move on them, the more they are secure 
in the sense that they can just 
continue to jockey and play their political 
game at the expense of American 
dollars and American interests and 
American lives. Without real deadlines 

to force them, there is no way to actually 
determine that we can make the 
progress we need to make. Since January, 
when the President decided to disregard 
key elements of the Iraq Study 
Group and announced the escalation, 
over 340 American troops have died, 
and there is still no fundamental 
progress. 

The legislation we have sent to the 
President would change this dynamic. 
It would force the Iraqis to either 
stand up for Iraq and meet the political 
benchmarks they have agreed to or decide 
they can’t do it and have their 
fight. 

It calls for a flexible timetable for 
the redeployment in 2008, and I underscore 
‘‘flexible.’’ Every time we try to 
do something, we get into this totally 
phony, polarized debate where the 
President and his henchmen go out and 
talk about reckless abandonment and 
surrender and defeatism when, in fact, 
what we are proposing gives the President 
all the discretion in the world—to 
leave troops there to finish the training 
of Iraqis, which is the fundamental 
reason we are there; to leave troops 
there to chase al-Qaida, to prosecute 
the war on terror, which is in our interests, 
and to leave troops to protect 
American forces and protect American 
facilities. After 6 years of the war, 
what other fundamental mission 
should there be for American forces? 

It seems to me the real debate is one 
that should center around the failures 
of this administration to face that reality 
and the few choices we have now 
to try to achieve success. The most important 
choice that has to be made to 
achieve success is to engage in full-
throated diplomacy, not dissimilar to 
the kind of meeting that will be held in 
Sharm el-Sheikh this week. We hope 
Secretary Rice will take advantage of 
that and that the countries of the region 
will come together around a new 
security arrangement and a new understanding 
of what has to happen. 

The timetable for the redeployment 
in the legislation sent to the President 
is not arbitrary, and it is not precipitous. 
It is consistent with the Iraq 
Study Group’s recommendations and 
with the timeframe for transferring 
control of Iraq to the Iraqis that was 
set forth by General Casey. It also has 
the schedule agreed upon by the Iraqi 
Government itself. There is nothing arbitrary 
in a schedule to which your 
own commanding general and the Iraqi 
Government have agreed. 

Even the President has said, under 
his new strategy, responsibility for security 
would be transferred to Iraqis 
before the end of this year. So they are 
willing to set a date. The administration 
can set a date for the transfer of 
the security, but it is unwilling to set 
a date for the beginning of the draw-
down of some troops so you guarantee 
that date for the transfer of security is 
actually meaningful. The President has 
said it. Our generals have said it. The 
Iraq Study Group has said it. Now it is 


S5366 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

time for the President to embrace legislation 
that makes those words reality. 


Instead of accepting the change that 
is necessary, we keep hearing we need 
more of the same; we have to give the 
surge time to work; the Iraqis need 
just a little more breathing space to 
start making political progress. 

General Petraeus has said, however, 
that he won’t be able to make any 
progress assessment on the ground 
until September. Guess what. We hear 
that Iraq’s Parliament, which has only 
been able to muster a quorum to even 
consider legislation about once every 
week or two—the Iraqi Parliament 
plans to take a 2-month vacation this 
summer, a vacation in the middle of a 
civil war. You sort of wonder what 
Abraham Lincoln would think of that. 
Iraq is descending further into chaos as 
thousands of Iraqis die each month. If 
the Iraqis go on vacation without making 
the key political compromises, it 
will absolutely guarantee that there is 
not going to be any meaningful political 
progress until next fall. I do not 
believe that America should be sending 
our troops to die for somebody else’s 
vacation. 

How many more American soldiers 
are going to give their lives without 
any hope of achieving a real political 
solution? 300? 400? 500? How many more 
doors are going to be knocked on and 
phone calls made? How many more visits 
to Arlington and other cemeteries 
across America, while the Iraqis procrastinate 
and refuse to settle their 
differences? 

How can any of us in the Chamber 
look in the eyes of the parents of any 
young American killed and tell them: 
Your son or daughter died so the Iraqis 
can take the summer off? 

With every passing day it becomes 
clearer this Iraqi Government is not 
going to get the job done. It is not 
truly a unity government, it is a figleaf 
for politicians who are pursuing sectarian 
interests instead of protecting 
the nation they are charged with saving. 
Now it is starting to crumble 
under the weight of its own ineffectiveness 
and corruption. 

Last week some prominent Iraqi legislators 
came out and said publicly 
that they have lost confidence in the 
Maliki government. That is not surprising 
since we recently learned that 
Prime Minister Maliki was responsible 
for a politically motivated purge of 
Iraqi military leaders who had the 
gumption to actually act against the 
Mahdi militia. 

Yesterday the largest block of Sunni 
Arabs in the Parliament threatened to 
withdraw its Ministers from the Shiite-
dominated Cabinet in frustration over 
the Government’s failure to deal with 
Sunni concerns. As one Sunni legislator 
said: 

The problem is not just with sectarian 
practices but with the Government’s ineffectiveness. 


This Government we are supporting 
is spiraling downward into greater and 

greater ineffectiveness. In the process, 
Iraq is spiraling deeper and deeper into 
its sectarian divide. 

It is not just the Iraqis. Last week we 
learned that several prominent Sunni 
countries are balking at complete debt 
relief for Iraq because of the lack of 
progress in political reconciliation. 
This past weekend the Saudis refused 
to allow Prime Minister Maliki to visit 
their country because he has not delivered 
on his promise to seek real reconciliation 
with Iraqi Sunnis. How can 
we expect progress and political reconciliation 
if the Iraqis have lost confidence 
in the Maliki government? How 
can we expect diplomatic progress 
when Iraq’s neighbors have lost confidence 
in Iraqi leadership? This is a 
very serious issue. 

The administration has finally done 
what they should have done years ago: 
engaged, this week, in the kind of diplomacy 
that is desperately needed. On 
the eve of the summit, we learned that 
some of the major players have no confidence 
in the political process. So if 
we really want to bring about the political 
and diplomatic solution that is 
the only solution, the time has come 
now for new leadership in Iraq. 

When I was in Iraq in December, 
Prime Minister Maliki told me he was 
working on forming a new coalition 
that would isolate extremists unwilling 
to compromise and empower moderates 
who were. Since then we have heard 
from time to time that these negotiations 
continue behind the scenes. But 
nothing has happened. It is time to get 
out from behind the scenes. It is time 
to have a government that can put the 
pieces back together. 

As one Iraqi Minister said yesterday, 
Mr. Maliki ‘‘said he was going to appoint 
new Ministers; he needs to do 
that. . . . What is he waiting for?’’ 

That is a question the U.S. Congress 
should echo. We simply cannot go on 
like this, day after day, news cycle 
after news cycle—more bombs, more 
murders, more assassinations, more 
suicide bombings, more killings, more 
American soldiers dead. We can’t go on 
like this and expect the situation to 
miraculously get better. Time is not on 
our side. Time is not on anyone’s side 
in the end because if this does go downward 
into greater sectarian violence, 
all of the Iraqis will lose. 

If we are serious about a political solution, 
we need a fresh start. That is 
why I believe it is time for Prime Minister 
Maliki to make wholesale 
changes in his Cabinet. He already has 
to replace the six Muqtada al-Sadr 
Ministers, the Sadrist Ministers who 
recently resigned. He should use that 
as an opportunity to fire any other 
Minister who is not committed to political 
reconciliation and replace them 
with Ministers who are. 

We should make it clear this truly is 
his last chance. If reshuffling the Cabinet 
does not produce meaningful political 
progress within a relatively short 
period of time, then he should step 
down and allow a new leader to step 

forward. Putting Mr. Maliki’s personal 
political future on the line is perhaps 
one of the few ways left to try to create 
the leverage necessary to find out 
if he is capable of moving the reconciliation 
procession forward. If he proves 
unwilling or unable, then clearly someone 
else should be given a chance—if 
there is someone else. 

This is the moment to put that to the 
test. I recognize that Iraqis must take 
responsibility for their own future and 
that any government we impose will 
lack legitimacy with their fellow 
Iraqis. But we can use our own influence 
behind the scenes to encourage 
the Iraqis to make the leadership 
changes so clearly needed in order to 
give their Government a chance to succeed. 
We certainly have a right to 
make that request, given the degree to 
which that Government is dependent 
on our troops and our money and our 
presence. 

Congress has finally done what this 
administration has stubbornly refused 
to do. I am proud of my fellow Members 
of this body who had the courage 
to vote for this legislation. I know how 
divisive it can be. I know how the other 
side uses it and how people tend to try 
to personalize and even denigrate people’s 
patriotism and concern for the 
Nation. The fact is, the Congress has 
done what needed to be done because 
this administration has not done it. 

People say don’t micromanage. 
Someone has to manage. They have 
clearly mismanaged every step of this 
war, and they have been absent from 
the diplomacy necessary. It is time to 
have a new strategy, time to hold Iraqi 
politicians responsible for their country’s 
future, time to get deadly serious 
about finding a political solution, and 
finding it now. 

Somehow this President still chooses 
to take a different tack. If President 
Bush vetoes this bill, which we understand 
he will, then he is the one standing 
in the way of a bipartisan strategy 
on Iraq. The Iraq Study Group was bipartisan. 
The Iraq Study Group had 
former Secretary of State Jim Baker, a 
Republican, a great friend of President 
Bush’s father. It had Secretary of State 
Larry Eagleburger. It had Al Simpson, 
former Senator from Wyoming and Republican 
leader in the Senate. It had 
Bill Perry, former Secretary of Defense; 
Chuck Robb; it had Ed Meese, 
former Attorney General and Chief of 
Staff to a Republican President. All of 
these are moderate, thoughtful, respected, 
trusted voices in foreign policy 
and in the affairs of our country. 
They all came together in a consensus. 
That consensus was summarily rejected 
by the President, just pushed 
aside. 

The President decided to go his own 
road, which even the generals and even 
Prime Minister Maliki did not want to 
do. I read one Senator’s comment that 
there is no plan B, that there is just 
plan A, which is the surge. I disagree 
with that. Plan B is what plan B should

have been all the time, which is to engage 
in the legitimate kind of intervention 
on a diplomatic level and to 
put on the table all of the issues of the 
region in a way that proves the kind of 
sincerity and seriousness of purpose 
that raises the level of credibility of 
the discussion so people can trust that 
we, in fact, are going to be moving in 
a common direction, which is in their 
interests. 

The reason Saudi Arabia is sending 
such public messages of discontent for 
the policies of this administration 
today is because, given what has happened, 
that is the way they have to 
play it in order to deal with their own 
politics of the region and their own 
politics of the street and their nation. 
It is our absence from a creative, diplomatic 
effort, it is our absence from a 
credible and legitimate diplomatic lift 
that has left no choice even to our 
friends than to begin to distance themselves 
from our country. 

With this veto, the President will 
deny our troops the vehicles they need, 
for the time being; he will deny them 
the basic care they deserve, for the 
time being, because all of us know the 
Congress will come back and we will 
fund those things. But the most significant 
thing he will deny us is the kind 
of leadership and the kind of consensus 
the country deserves in order to move 
forward in our policy in Iraq. 

We honor the lives lost in Iraq, not 
with words but with lives saved. We 
honor the lives lost in Iraq not with 
words and with the political partisanship 
here but with a policy that is 
right for them and for the region. We 
honor their sacrifice by creating a situation 
in the region where we protect 
America’s and the region’s interests at 
the same time and begin to recognize 
the degree to which our presence in 
Iraq is playing into the hands of the 
terrorists, is advancing the very cause 
we seek to fight, which is diminishing 
the ability of the United States to be 
able to leverage, not just the Middle 
East issues, but a host of other issues 
in the world. 

I believe we need to change course, 
and it is only by changing course that 
we will honor their sacrifice, respect 
our interests, and bring our troops 
home with honor. 

Madam President, I yield the floor, 
and suggest the absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Massachusetts is recognized. 

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. KENNEDY. I want to let our 
Members know about the substitute 
that has been included, that is before 
us now. It essentially clarifies the 
FDA’s authority to place restrictions 
on drugs with safety problems; applies 

only to drugs like Thalidomide that 
could not otherwise be approved. We 
can understand why it is important 
that the FDA probably would not have 
approved Thalidomide, for all of the 
dangers it has, but it has now approved 
it to deal with some of the problems of 
leprosy. We want to make sure it is not 
going to be out there and be utilized in 
terms of expectant mothers. So we 
have worked this out. I thank Senator 
COBURN for his help on this issue. 

We also make sure the FDA takes 
into account concerns of rural communities 
in setting safety policies. We 
have given enhanced authority to the 
FDA in terms of safety policies. We 
want to make sure in the implementation 
of those, particularly in rural 
areas, they are not going to be so restrictive 
as to limit the opportunities 
to get the necessary prescription drugs. 
I thank Senator HARKIN and Senator 
MURKOWSKI, who were enormously 
helpful in working through that issue. 

This also adds a Web portal for FDA 
so consumers will have a single point 
of access, via the Internet, to drug 
safety information. I thank Senator 
GREGG for that. That will be very important 
for consumers who are concerned 
about the safety issues. All of 
those changes and alterations are very 
helpful and valuable in terms of the 
legislation itself. 

I wish to speak for 3 minutes as in 
morning business and not under the 
time on the bill. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

f 

SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, 
the President is going to be making up 
his mind on the issue of the supplemental 
and making a judgment in the 
next several hours. President Bush 
stubbornly clings to the false hope that 
success is just around the corner and 
that the mission will be accomplished. 
We have heard it all before. Ending the 
rule of Saddam Hussein was supposed 
to lessen violence and bring a new wave 
of democracy into the Middle East. It 
has not. Saddam Hussein’s capture was 
supposed to quell the violence. It 
didn’t. Free elections and the drafting 
of the constitution were supposed to be 
a breakthrough. They weren’t. The 
surge was supposed to bring stability, 
essential to political reconciliation and 
economic reconstruction. It has not 
and it will not. 
Only the Iraqi people can save Iraq 
and it is time for them to do so. American 
military force cannot solve the 
problems of the Iraqi people. It is time 
for the President to put the Iraqis on 
notice that our military will begin to 
withdraw. No one in the administration 
can honestly tell the American 
people we are making progress in Iraq. 
It is time the President listened to the 
Iraq Study Group, Congress, and the 
American people, and work with us to 
bring our troops home. 
The President is wrong to veto the 
Iraq spending bill and reject its needed 

timeline for the orderly, responsible, 
and safe withdrawal of our forces from 
Iraq. He was wrong to lead us into the 
war, wrong to conduct it so poorly, and 
wrong to refuse to change course. 

We cannot continue business as usual 
in Iraq. It is time for America to end 
its participation in the brutal civil 
war. The message from the American 
people couldn’t be louder or clearer: Instead 
of defying the will of the American 
people, President Bush should listen 
to their plea and begin working 
with Congress to bring this tragic war 
to an end. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Wyoming. 

Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I am 
going to make even briefer remarks 
than the Senator from Massachusetts 
did. 

One of the questions I had been asked 
over the weekend was: Why hasn’t the 
President already vetoed the supplemental 
appropriations bill? He promised 
he would veto the bill because it 
has all this extra spending in it, with 
directions on the war from people who 
really are not even involved in administering 
the war. 

Of course, what I found out is the bill 
has not even been sent to the President 
yet. He cannot veto a bill until he receives 
a bill. So to chastise him for not 
having already vetoed the bill when 
there is a hold card keeping him from 
being able to veto the bill I think is unconscionable. 
Hanging on to that bill 
and not getting it there so the decisions 
can be made on it one way or the 
other just is not right. That is not the 
way to run the Senate. It is not the 
way to run the country. And it is not 
the President’s fault if he does not 
have the bill to make the decision. 

There can be a lot of debate on what 
that decision ought to be made and 
how to carry them out. I am certain 
the President will veto the bill; he has 
been very clear on that. There is a differing 
philosophy on how a war ought 
to be run. There are a lot of people 
throwing in the towel. It is kind of 
hard to win at anything if your opponent 
knows the point at which you are 
going to give up. 

That is where we are in this battle, 
with the complete direction to give up, 
to throw in the towel, to say what has 
been done over there has not done any 
good, won’t do any good, and to keep 
calling it a civil war. It is not a civil 
war. It is a religious war that is brewing. 
There is a tremendous difference. 
It is a religious war that involves the 
entire Middle East, not just Iraq. And 
in preparation, for what the other people 
in the Middle East have heard said 
on the Senate floor, armies are gearing 
up in Saudi Arabia and Syria and Israel 
and Iran, ready to move into the vacuum 
that would be caused by a U.S. departure. 


That will not be the first time there 
has been a religious war in the world. If 
we do not step in, it would probably be 
the first time we had the chance to 
stop a religious war and did not help. 


S5368 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

So we could leave, have a regional religious 
war, and then try to decide what 
we are going to do about that. 

Religious wars are not easy things to 
solve. We have seen that with Kosovo 
with religious genocide. We got to see 
what happened in Kosovo. We helped 
out in Kosovo just as we are helping in 
Iraq. 

So, Madam President, I hope we 
would actually debate the Food and 
Drug Administration bill, which is 
what we were set out to do this week. 
I hope people who have amendments 
would bring the amendments to the 
floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Massachusetts. 

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as 
we know, the supplemental passed last 
Thursday. It is Tuesday today. So the 
comments I made were directed to the 
fact that the President has announced 
he is going to veto it. I just wanted to 
comment about that issue. 

Although we differ on that issue, we 
are together in wanting to get the Senate 
to both debate and dispose of 
amendments. The afternoon is moving 
along. We had statements yesterday 
from Senator ENZI and myself on this 
legislation, spelling this out. We had 
an opportunity in our caucus today—I 
imagine the Senator did as well—to go 
through the details of the legislation. 
So we have addressed many of the concerns. 
But there are still some concerns 
that are out there, and this is an 
extremely important piece of legislation. 
So we are asking our colleagues 
to come to the floor to let us know 
their amendments, to see if we can 
work those out. If not, we would like to 
have the debate on those measures and 
let the Senate exercise its will. We are 
ready for those amendments, and we 
urge our colleagues to bring them to 
our attention at the earliest possible 
time. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR). The Senator from Illinois. 

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as in 
morning business before addressing the 
pending legislation. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 
there have been comments on the floor 
about the fact that in just 2 hours the 
President of the United States will 
have an opportunity to sign or veto a 
bill which literally will affect the lives 
of 150,000 soldiers and their families, if 
not every American. It is a bill that 
was passed by the House and Senate, 
with bipartisan votes in both bodies, 
and sent to the President. It fully 
funds the troops in Iraq, giving them 
all the resources they need, and more, 
so they can execute this war and their 
duties in a safe manner. 

But it also does something significant; 
it starts to change the mission in 
Iraq. We are in the fifth year of this 
war. We have lost 3,351 American lives. 
I respect very much the Senator from 
Wyoming. He tries to make a point 

that it is not a civil war. My understanding 
of a civil war is when people 
of the same nation are at war with one 
another. 

That, sadly, is the reality of what is 
going on in Iraq today—Iraqis killing 
one another while Americans stand in 
the midst of the crossfire. Had the 
President of the United States come to 
this Congress in October of 2002 and 
suggested we send 150,000 soldiers into 
Iraq for the purpose of refereeing a 
civil war or a religious war that had its 
origins in 14 centuries of anger, had he 
said to us we must stay as long as 5 
years and spend $500 billion and risk 
thousands of American lives, with no 
end in sight, what were the chances we 
would have passed that resolution? 
None. That is not what the President 
told us. 

He told us Iraq was a threat to the 
United States of America with weapons 
of mass destruction, and nuclear weapons, 
that somehow they had been in 
concert with al-Qaida, that led to 9/11. 
None of those things turned out to be 
true—not one of them. 

On that basis, we authorized the 
President to go to war, and he decided 
to take a preventive course of action— 
not preemptive but preventive course 
of action—and invade this country before 
they threatened the United States. 
That is what we are in today. 

Within 2 hours, the President will 
pick up a pen and have a chance to 
start bringing this to an end. If he 
signs this bill we have sent to him, it 
will mean that American soldiers can 
start coming home and that, equally 
important, the Iraqis understand it is 
now their country, their war, and their 
future, that they have to put their 
lives on the line and not rely on the 
bravery of our soldiers to keep their 
country intact. 

If the President vetoes this bill, exactly 
the opposite message goes to the 
Iraqis. Its message: Continue business 
as usual. Continue waiting out the political 
opposition, not resolving your 
differences, really allowing this religious 
or civil war to become even 
worse. 

The month of April was the deadliest 
month for American soldiers this year. 
We continue to see thousands of Iraqis 
killed each month in this country. The 
President, though he is limited in support 
for this position, continues to 
argue that with just a few more American 
soldiers, a little longer period of 
time, some more money, everything is 
going to get better. Many of us are 
skeptical. The American people believe—
and I concur with their belief— 
we do need a timetable to start bringing 
American troops home on a responsible, 
reasonable basis. 

I hope the President will reconsider. 
I hope he will sign this bill. I hope the 
troops will be funded and the direction 
of this war will change. 

Madam President, this bill is for the 
Food and Drug Administration’s reauthorization. 
This is an agency which is 
often overlooked. Madam President, 

$1.7 billion a year in a Federal budget 
is not a huge amount of money. There 
are many other agencies with less responsibility 
and more resources. The 
Food and Drug Administration is responsible 
for really determining the 
safety of so many things American 
families take for granted: when you are 
buying food, when you are buying 
drugs, when you are buying over-the-
counter medicines. Many of the appliances 
you buy really have to be tested 
to be safe by the Food and Drug Administration. 
We count on this small 
agency to do a very big job and a job 
that gets bigger by the year. 

The bill that is before us is basically 
the law which authorizes the Food and 
Drug Administration to do its business. 
I am glad we brought it to the floor. I 
salute Senator ENZI on the Republican 
side and Senator KENNEDY on the 
Democratic side for their leadership. 

The Food and Drug Administration is 
an essential guardian of the public’s 
health and safety in America. In recent 
years, their reputation has been at risk 
because of incidents of drug safety 
problems and questions about their 
independence. The FDA has been faulted 
for neglecting its drug safety responsibilities 
and for failing to respond 
to concerns raised by its own drug safety 
specialists. 

Experts have warned that the FDA 
does not have adequate authority to 
pull dangerous drugs off the market, 
mandate changes in drug labels, or 
sanction drug companies that do not 
monitor drug safety. 

The most glaring example of a drug 
safety problem is the handling of 
Vioxx, a painkiller that was found to 
increase the risk of heart attack and 
stroke and was used by 20 million people 
across America. Merck was aware— 
the company that made Vioxx—that 
product raised the risk of cardiovascular 
problems, and they continued 
to market it, nevertheless, long before 
it stopped selling the drug in 2004. The 
episode has raised serious questions 
about FDA’s ability to react quickly to 
signs of safety problems with drugs already 
on the market. 

Listen to what one of FDA’s own 
drug safety experts said in testimony 
before the Senate Finance Committee. 
I quote: 

I would argue that the FDA, as currently 
configured, is incapable of protecting America 
against another Vioxx. We are virtually 
defenseless. 

That is quite a statement. It troubles 
me. 

That concern of that individual does 
not stand alone. A survey of FDA scientists 
conducted last year by the 
Union of Concerned Scientists found 
the following: 47 percent of FDA scientists 
said their FDA office is less effective 
than it was 5 years ago; nearly 
40 percent said the FDA is not acting 
effectively to protect public health; 
more than one-third of FDA scientists 
said FDA officials care more about approving 
new drugs and devices than ensuring 
they are safe; and 15 percent 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5369 

said they personally have been inappropriately 
asked to exclude or alter information 
or conclusions for nonscientific 
reasons. That is a horrible comment on 
an agency with the responsibility of 
the Food and Drug Administration. 

Our priority must be to take this reauthorization 
as an opportunity to 
change the FDA. The bill does that. It 
restores balance between timely approval 
of innovative drugs and safety 
and effectiveness. 

Problems with drug safety in recent 
years highlight the limits of FDA’s 
ability to monitor and respond to safety 
problems that arise after approval. 
Safety problems may not be detected 
prior to FDA approval because the clinical 
trials FDA relies upon often involve 
only a few thousand people. 

This bill, S. 1082, responds to this 
problem by making postapproval monitoring 
of drugs a core responsibility of 
the FDA, strengthening and clarifying 
the tools it has to make their products 
safer. The bill requires active monitoring 
for drug safety problems 
through the use of Federal and private 
databases. It creates a system for approving 
drugs with a specific strategy 
for evaluating and mitigating their 
risks. It promotes greater transparency 
by disclosing information on clinical 
trials. 

These and other provisions in this bipartisan 
bill will help to restore public 
confidence in the FDA. S. 1082 will help 
FDA fulfill its crucial and complex 
mission. I look forward to supporting 
it. 

One of the things most people do not 
realize is the major responsibility the 
Food and Drug Administration has for 
the food we eat. 

Now, let me tell you at the outset, I 
am not capable, having served on Capitol 
Hill for a few years, to describe to 
the people who follow this debate what 
we call the food safety system in America. 
Imagine, if you will, that we have 
12 to 15 different Federal agencies responsible 
for food safety. Imagine 30 
different laws and legal standards for 
food safety, 40 or 50 different committees 
on Capitol Hill with jurisdiction, 
hundreds, if not thousands, of lobbyists 
and special interest groups hovering 
over this whole scene. Add to that 
thousands of Government workers and 
bureaucrats who are protecting their 
turf, and we have a system that is virtually 
out of control—not just when it 
comes to drugs, as important as they 
are, but when it comes to the food we 
eat. 

I thank Chairman KENNEDY and Senator 
ENZI and others for partnering 
with me on an amendment which I will 
offer as soon as I am given the green 
light by the chairman and the ranking 
member on the issue of food safety. I 
thank them for working with my staff 
for several months to come up with 
language to the deal with some serious 
challenges. 

For too long, we have gone without 
updating the resources and authorities 
of the FDA in the area of food safety. 

I think our system has broken down. 
Now is the time for an appropriate 
amendment to close some of the gaps 
we have in our current system. 

In the larger picture, I have been 
working on this issue for a long time. 
I said, over 10 years ago, we need a single 
food safety system. 

I see Senator LIEBERMAN from Connecticut 
on the floor. His House colleague, 
Congresswoman ROSA 
DELAURO, herself a victim of food poisoning 
at an early age, has been my 
ally in this effort. We believe a single 
food safety system, based on science 
and not on politics, is the only answer. 
We need to do that and do it soon. 

The amendment which I am going to 
offer does not reach that level. It does 
not achieve all of the goals we wanted 
to on a legal basis, but it moves us forward. 


How important an issue is food safety? 
The Centers for Disease Control estimates 
that as many as 76 million people 
suffer from food poisoning each 
year. Thirty-two thousand Americans 
will be hospitalized each year for food 
poisoning; 5,000 will die. With emerging 
pathogens, an aging population, and an 
increasing volume of food imports, this 
situation isn’t going to improve without 
decisive action. 

I agree with Chairman KENNEDY and 
Senator ENZI that we should proceed 
with the broad issue of food safety 
within general order, and I appreciate 
their willingness to work with me. The 
amendment is not what I hoped for in 
creating a single food safety agency, 
but it is a step forward. 

The most recent news, of course, is 
about pet food, but believe me, it 
hasn’t been that long ago when we 
talked about salmonella-contaminated 
peanut butter and E. coli-contaminated 
spinach. If it seems as if these food crises 
are occurring more frequently, they 
are. We may have the safest food supply 
in the world, but the fact is, every 
parent, every family wants to have 
peace of mind that when they buy 
something at the grocery store, they 
can put it on the table, feed it to their 
family, and no one will get sick. There 
are questions that are being raised almost 
on a daily basis about whether we 
can have that confidence. 

The issue that came up recently was 
on pet food. Batches of wheat gluten 
and rice protein concentrate contaminated 
with a chemical called melamine 
were imported from China by several 
shipping companies. We just learned 
over the last few days from stories 
printed in the press that melamine is 
regularly added to animal feed in 
China. 

Why would they add a chemical 
called melamine to something they are 
going to feed to livestock? Well, it is a 
way to increase the value of the product. 
If there is more protein in the 
feed, then they can charge a higher 
price. When the food product is tested 
to see if there is protein, you look for 
the presence of nitrogen. The chemical, 
melamine, when added, tests for higher 

nitrogen levels, therefore they argue 
higher protein levels, therefore they 
argue they should be paid more. So it 
is an economic fraud. They have argued 
that this is a product that doesn’t hurt 
people. We are not sure of that, but we 
do know that the animals that died as 
a result of contaminated pet food, some 
of them were found to have melamine 
in their system. It is a serious question 
as to whether it is toxic. 

We know now that this pet food contamination 
has resulted in the deaths 
of more than 4,000 animals across 
America. This contaminated product 
came into America without inspection 
or without suspicion. The FDA did not 
have a memorandum of understanding 
with China or a certification that their 
standards for food safety were even 
close to those of the United States. The 
product made its way from the importer 
ChemNutra into various manufacturers 
of pet food. Menu Foods is a 
Canadian company. They make pet 
food under a dozen different labels. 
They learned on February 20 there was 
a problem. How did they know there 
was a problem? The cats and dogs told 
them. They stopped eating their food 
and they started getting sick. 

So you own a company that has dozens 
of different pet food labels, and you 
notice that animals are getting sick. 
What is the responsible thing for a 
company to do at that time? Pull the 
product off the shelf and notify the 
Federal Government. They waited 3 
weeks before they sent out a notification. 
By the time the Food and Drug 
Administration learned about this, 
there were millions of cans of pet food 
and other products under different labels 
spread all across America with 
this contaminated product. Three 
weeks they waited. Why? Because the 
law does not currently require them to 
report on a timely basis. 

I asked the FDA last week: What is 
the penalty against Menu Foods for 
waiting 3 weeks? They said: Well, we 
are considering. We are talking to our 
counsel. We will get back to you. 
Months have passed. Nothing has happened. 
Menu Foods waited 3 weeks instead 
of reporting on a timely basis. By 
then, the product was all across America. 


In the case of rice protein concentrate, 
there is less certainty. Importer 
Wilbur Ellis purchased product 
from the Binzhou Futian Company in 
China. It then distributed the product 
to a host of companies that produce pet 
food. These brands and labels have been 
recalled in a haphazard way over the 
past 3 weeks—again, delays in reporting. 
The FDA has even refused to name 
several companies for more than a 
week trying to get to the bottom of 
this investigation because the records 
process is so broken down at this agency. 


One or more of the manufacturers 
sold some refuse pet food that it produced 
using contaminated product to 
hog farms in California and other 
States. These farms fed their hogs the 


S5370 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

contaminated feed, some of which was 
sold to consumers and much more of it 
has been quarantined and is slated for 
destruction. 

In addition, we just learned this week 
that 38 poultry farms in Indiana received 
contaminated feed. So the plot 
thickens, and the safety issue grows as 
we wonder if what was originally pet 
food is now being fed to livestock, and 
if humans consume the food what impact 
it will have. 

There is a mystery importer involved 
as well from China that we have heard 
about but we can’t identify yet. Supposedly 
this second importer purchased 
rice protein from the Chinese firm in 
question in larger quantities than the 
firm Wilbur Ellis. 

In terms of the investigation in 
China, the FDA said: We want to send 
inspectors to China to see what they 
are sending to us. Well, first the Chinese 
said: We deny you the visas for 
your FDA inspectors. Imagine that. 
Millions of dollars worth of foodstuffs 
coming in from China, contaminated 
and poisoned, killing off pets, threatening 
human consumption, and when 
we say to the Chinese that we want to 
take a look at their production facilities, 
they denied us visas. I joined with 
Congresswoman DELAURO and sent a 
letter to the Chinese Embassy, and 
they reversed their position, offering 
the visas. We have to make it clear to 
China and every other country that if 
they want to do business with the 
United States, they will do it on our 
terms when it comes to health and 
safety. We will never allow them to 
compromise the safety and health of 
American citizens in the process. 

The amendment I am going to offer— 
and I hope it will be accepted—does 
several things based on what we have 
learned over the last 6 weeks. First, 
during this recall, consumers, veterinarians, 
and retailers, among others, 
expressed concern about the scope of 
the recall, what products were included, 
or what not to feed to domestic 
animals. The FDA was slow, uneven, 
and inconsistent in sharing information 
on the recall. While there are 
mechanisms in place to proactively 
track human food-borne illnesses and 
then share information, no similar system 
exists for companion animals. 

I visited the FDA pet food recall Web 
site the day before the March 12 Agriculture 
appropriations hearing and 
found a jumble of corporate press releases. 
It was virtually unintelligible. I 
said to the FDA: Can’t you make this 
information clearer so consumers can 
have the information they need to purchase 
these products? They took it to 
heart and made the changes. That is 
good. 

In addition, following the recall, the 
FDA checked the records of companies 
such as Banfield, the largest privately 
owned veterinary hospital chain in the 
United States. The records kept 
showed a statistically significant increase 
in the instances of renal failures 
of cats. A system in place to track 

these events might have caught something 
like melamine earlier. So the 
amendment creates an early warning 
and surveillance system for companion 
animals and directs the Secretary to 
work with professional organizations, 
veterinarians, and others to disseminate 
information. 

While we are at it, the amendment 
would direct the FDA, in cases of both 
pet food and human food, to keep up-
to-date, comprehensive, searchable recall 
lists on their Web site. 

Second, the amendment closes the 
gap that FDA itself identified in an 
earlier draft framework posted on its 
Web site in December of 2006. The guidances 
and practices that govern the pet 
food industry are currently generated 
by the American Association of Feed 
Control Officers, known as AAFCO. 
The guidelines on best practices and ingredient 
lists are updated annually and 
implemented on a voluntary basis by 
manufacturers and State departments 
of agriculture. However, there is no requirement 
under the law for States to 
adopt these practices, and they don’t 
have the force of Federal guidelines. 
Inspections are not coordinated State 
to State, and some States have different 
standards. While the FDA participates 
in the AAFCO process, it does 
not provide a list of ingredients and additives. 
AAFCO’s list is more comprehensive 
than the FDA’s. Our amendment 
would direct the FDA to work 
with AAFCO and other stakeholders to 
give these guidelines the force of law. 

Third, the amendment closes a loophole 
that this contamination has exposed 
with regard to our imports of 
food. The source of the contamination 
we know of was wheat gluten and rice 
protein concentrate originating in 
China. Neither shipment was inspected 
by the FDA. If you have some peace of 
mind or belief that a Federal inspector 
is watching food as it comes into the 
United States, the odds are 99 to 1 you 
are wrong. Only about 1 or 1.5 percent 
of all the shipments of food products 
coming into the United States are actually 
inspected. 

As imports have increased the number 
of inspectors have decreased. This 
is an indication of U.S. food imports by 
country. As you can see, there have 
been dramatic increases in these fiscal 
years showing that the amount of food 
coming into the United States is increasing 
in volume. The number of inspectors 
who watch for this food to 
protect our families and consumers 
across America just hasn’t kept pace. 

In 2003, the United States imported 
$45.6 billion worth of agricultural products—
in 2003; today, $64 billion. Agricultural 
imports from China have almost 
doubled in that period of time, 
from $1.2 billion to $2.1 billion. Due to 
flat budgets and increasing responsibilities, 
the overall number of FDA inspectors 
looking at these shipments 
and at domestic food processors has actually 
decreased from 2003 to the 
present time; imports up, inspectors 
down. 

Are we surprised at what has happened? 
The FDA doesn’t have the resources 
or the authority to make sure 
what we are bringing in from overseas 
is safe. We need to tackle it in a larger 
bill. 

What our amendment does is close 
the loophole by improving data collection 
and reporting. It creates an FDA 
database of food adulterants that 
would be filled by FDA inspectors as 
well as importers of food. The extra series 
of data points would better pick 
out trends and help FDA do a better 
risk-based inspection job. It also creates 
a system in which adulterations 
are reported quickly so as to prevent 
contamination from spreading. This 
would have helped in this most recent 
case, but because of delays in reporting 
it led to an expansion of recalled product 
into dozens of different companies 
and got perilously close to the human 
food chain. The data would then be 
used by the Secretary to issue import 
alerts, blocking similar risky products. 

I have also pursued a separate track 
on the issue of resources for FDA by 
sending a letter to Chairman KOHL of 
Wisconsin and Senator BENNETT of 
Utah requesting additional resources 
for food inspection at the Food and 
Drug Administration. I hope my colleagues 
will join me in that effort. 

Also, I am filing an amendment that 
would authorize a study on user fees 
for food producers. It is vital that we 
explore various revenue streams for the 
FDA in light of the shortage of resources 
they have for inspection. 

The last two items in my amendment 
are a sense of the Senate and a clarification 
that companies are required to 
maintain records and make them accessible 
to the FDA as part of an investigation. 
This latter item would prevent 
delays that keep contaminations 
from being known as quickly as possible. 
In the case of recalled peanut 
butter this past winter, an FDA report 
showed that inspectors were denied 
documents when they were requested. 
The language would clarify that when 
the FDA makes the inspection, it will 
have access to those documents needed 
for purposes of safeguarding the food 
supply. 

The sense-of-the-Senate language 
goes beyond this amendment and this 
bill, stating that it is vital to update 
resources, direction, and authorities of 
the FDA to better safeguard our food 
supply. The sense of the Senate directs 
the FDA to work with our trading partners 
to establish cooperative agreements. 


Several weeks ago, Robert Brackett, 
Director of the FDA’s food arm, said: 

These outbreaks point to a need to completely 
overhaul the way the agency does 
business. 

I am thankful the sponsors of this 
legislation for the reauthorization of 
the Food and Drug Administration understand 
that expanding the scope of 
our debate on this bill to include food 
safety is overdue. 

Mr. Brackett went on to say: 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5371 

We have 60,000 to 80,000 facilities that we 
are responsible for in any given year. We 
have to get out of the 1950s paradigm. 

Dr. Stephen Sundlof, Director of the 
Center for Veterinary Medicine of 
FDA, which has jurisdiction for pet 
food, implied as much when he was 
quoted last month as saying: 

In this case, we’re going to have to look at 
this after the dust settles and determine if 
there is something from a regulatory standpoint 
that we could have done differently to 
prevent this incident from occurring. 

I couldn’t agree more. This is a situation 
where we need one food safety 
agency, not driven by the politics of 
Washington but driven by science, to 
make sure the food fed to our children, 
the food fed to our pets, or any food 
served in America is as safe as possible. 
As we import more food with fewer inspectors, 
the risk increases. 

I might add that we have looked at 
the pet food contamination and others 
from the aspect of greed and negligence. 
In the instance of China, they 
were adulterating their product with a 
chemical so that it was worth more in 
the marketplace. That is economic 
fraud. In the instance of spinach and 
peanut butter, we are dealing with negligence—
negligence that results in a 
deadly product being sold across America. 
But we can’t stop there, unfortunately. 
In the world we live in, with 
the vulnerabilities we have, food could 
also become a terrorist weapon. That 
may sound far-fetched to some, but 
when Governor Tommy Thompson left 
the Bush Cabinet, he said in parting 
that he found it hard to imagine why 
the terrorists had not attacked our 
food supply. He said he worried about 
it on a regular basis. 

We have to have inspection standards 
in place that mitigate against greed 
and negligence and the possibility of 
someone intentionally contaminating 
our food supply, causing terrible suffering 
and death across America. 

That is why this amendment is a step 
in the direction for a safer food supply. 
I sincerely hope my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle will support my efforts. 


I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Connecticut is recognized. 

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that I be able 
to speak as in morning business. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS 

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, 
I rise this afternoon to encourage 
President Bush to go ahead and veto 
the supplemental appropriations bill 
that Congress has sent him this afternoon 
because of the language in that 
bill on Iraq that I consider to be bad 
for our troops and dangerous for our 
country. 

The legislation that Congress has 
passed, in my opinion, represents the 
worst of all worlds. As I have said before, 
if people feel the war in Iraq is 
lost, or if people feel it is not lost but 

not worth fighting for, then what they 
ought to do is act to end the war. This 
legislation would do no such thing. It 
would not end the war in Iraq. It will 
not require the withdrawal of all American 
troops from Iraq. It will not cut 
off funding for the war in Iraq. 

On the contrary, what this legislation 
proposes to do is something far 
worse. It would handcuff our soldiers 
with an inflexible and arbitrary set of 
restrictions—restrictions that would 
take life-and-death decisions about 
how, when, and where our troops can 
fight away from those troops and their 
commanders. It would substitute the 
judgment of politicians in Washington 
for the judgment of our military commanders 
on the ground. That is wrong. 

What is more, this legislation will 
impose on our soldiers in Iraq a binding 
deadline of October 1, 2007—5 months 
from today—to begin withdrawal. That 
withdrawal would be required to begin 
regardless of conditions on the ground, 
regardless of the recommendations of 
our military leaders, regardless of the 
opinions of our allies in the region—in 
short, regardless of reality—on October 
1, 2007. 

This is a deadline as arbitrary as it is 
inflexible. It is a deadline for defeat— 
defeat for America and a defeat for the 
hopes of the majority of the Iraqi people 
for a better, freer future. 

I know we have heard from some supporters 
of this legislation that by ordering 
a withdrawal we will encourage 
the Iraqis to make political compromises. 
Where is the evidence of 
this? 

According to the legislation this Congress 
has now sent to the President, 
the withdrawal must begin regardless 
of what the Iraqi Government does. 
Where, then, is the incentive for the 
Iraqis to reconcile? On the contrary, 
there is every reason to conclude this 
legislation will have exactly the opposite 
effect that its sponsors claim for 
it. 

Listen to the latest National Intelligence 
Estimate on Iraq, which has 
been saluted by Members of this Chamber 
on both sides of the question of 
what to do now in Iraq. That latest National 
Intelligence Estimate predicted 
that a withdrawal of American troops 
in the months ahead would ‘‘almost 
certainly lead to a significant increase 
in the scale and scope of sectarian violence, 
intensify Sunni resistance, and 
have adverse effects on national reconciliation.’’ 


How do the supporters of this legislation 
explain that National Intelligence 
Estimate? For that matter, how do 
they justify this legislation, in light of 
what we all heard directly from GEN 
David Petraeus, the commander of our 
forces in Iraq, when we spoke with him 
and he spoke with us last week? 

General Petraeus told us very clearly 
that we have achieved progress since 
our new strategy in Iraq—the so-called 
surge—began. Consider the situation in 
Anbar Province to the West of Baghdad, 
which has dramatically improved. 

That has been documented not by representatives 
of the administration or 
people who support the current policy 
but on the front pages of the New York 
Times and USA Today in the last few 
days. 

At a moment when Sunnis in Anbar 
are finally helping us in targeting al-
Qaida terrorists, this legislation would 
require us to abandon them. 

Madam President, what message are 
we sending to our friends and our foes 
with this ill-advised legislation? We 
have heard from some that we need to 
abandon Iraq because it is not part of 
the war on terror. But here again, listen 
to General Petraeus, who is on the 
ground, one of the most outstanding 
generals of our military that I have 
met since I have been a Senator, confirmed 
unanimously by the Senate a 
short while ago. Here is what General 
Petraeus warned us: 

Iraq is, in fact, the central front of al-
Qaida’s global campaign against us. 

Let me repeat that. General Petraeus 
said: 

Iraq is, in fact, the central front of al-
Qaida’s global campaign against us. 

If we withdraw, as this legislation 
would require us to begin to do, al-
Qaida wins—the same al-Qaida that attacked 
America on September 11, 2001, 
killing 3,000 innocents, the same al-
Qaida that intends to attack us again, 
the same al-Qaida that has made very 
clear to us what its plans for domination 
and control of large sectors of the 
world are. 

Madam President, the violence we 
are seeing in Iraq today, the suicide 
bombings in Baghdad, the chemical 
weapons attacks in Anbar Province, 
the targeted assassinations of Iraq’s 
leaders—these are all primarily the 
work of al-Qaida. So the big question, 
then, for me—and I ask my colleagues 
to consider it—is whether we respond 
to al-Qaida’s terrorism by pulling out, 
as it hopes we do, and as this legislation 
would require us to do—abandoning 
the future of Iraq, the Middle 
East, and ultimately our own American 
security, to the very people responsible 
for the terrible atrocities and 
suicide bombings we see in Iraq today. 

The alternative to pulling out is 
standing up and fighting. That is what 
we are doing now in Iraq and doing 
with some success in Baghdad and 
Anbar Province. Rather than undermining 
General Petraeus and handing 
al-Qaida a victory, Congress should 
take swift and responsible action to get 
General Petraeus and our troops in the 
field the support they need to prevail. 

The Iraq war is not lost. But if this 
supplemental became law, it would be 
lost and America would suffer the consequences 
of that defeat for generations. 


President Bush, veto this bill. 

I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence 
of a quorum.

S5372 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we 
are still looking for amendments. It is 
true that there are probably four important 
areas where negotiations are 
going on with the principals in a bipartisan 
way, and progress is being made. 
It does seem to us that we ought to 
continue that progress. We will describe 
in greater detail those procedures 
tomorrow. 

We are urging our colleagues who 
have amendments to get in touch with 
us. We know this is complex legislation, 
but it is enormously important, 
and we have a lot of business in the 
Senate. Our leaders have indicated that 
they wanted us to be ready to move 
ahead on amendments. Senator ENZI 
and I are quite prepared to do so. 

I understand the Senator from Michigan, 
Ms. STABENOW, has an amendment 
she is going to speak to and offer later 
on. We will look forward to her presence. 


We want to again underline the importance 
that if Members have amendments, 
notify us as soon as possible, so 
we can work on them and accept them 
if we can. We want to be able to conclude 
this legislation in a timely way 
in the not-too-distant future. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Wyoming is recognized. 

Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank 
the Senator from Massachusetts for his 
comments. I’ll make a slight addition 
to what he said. For some, it may not 
look as if there is a lot of progress 
being made, but I assure you there is a 
lot of progress being made. One of the 
secrets to our committee operation— 
which used to be one of the most contentious 
committees in the Senate, and 
now it works productively on issues 
such as this to get things done—is that 
we recognize if somebody brings an 
amendment to the floor and we have 
not heard about it before, it creates 
difficulty. When the amendment is 
filed, we don’t have a real good process 
for amending an amendment. Technically, 
we can, but it requires a lot of 
time and votes. In the meantime, it polarizes 
people. Instead, we take a look 
at them, talk about them, and we use 
the body of knowledge we have gained 
from a lot of hearings on the issue to 
show where there could be inconsistencies 
and problems with the amendment. 
We get the problems ironed out 
so the amendment can have a logical 
chance for inclusion if it adds to what 
we are doing. 

That is what is going on as we are 
speaking. The Kennedy staff and the 
Enzi staff, and those Senators with 
amendments are meeting together and 
working out difficulties. We will accept 
many of them. Some of them are already 
in the substitute bill we have. So 
a lot of progress has already been made 
on this bill. We want to get the remain


ing things cleared up. We would like to 
get it done tonight and tomorrow, if 
possible. I think we are getting a long 
way down the list now on problems 
that people had with it, and we are getting 
those cleared up in a way that I 
think both sides can agree on. 

So that is why this is not quite as 
controversial as some people might expect 
or perhaps even want. I thank the 
Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, 
for all his cooperation on this 
and the tremendous effort of all the 
staff. We need people to come down 
with amendments, particularly if they 
have something new that we have not 
heard about. 

I yield the floor and suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The assistant legislative clerk proceeded 
to call the roll. 

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
SALAZAR). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 

Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak today on this FDA bill that has 
been brought forward by Chairman 
KENNEDY and Senator ENZI. I begin by 
thanking them for their cooperative, 
collegial, and inclusive approach over 
the last couple of weeks to get this bill 
in a form that makes it much more effective, 
accomplishing the goals we all 
have. 

Senator KENNEDY and Senator ENZI 
for a long time have been great advocates 
of making sure we have a strong 
and effective FDA. Senator KENNEDY, 
of course, has been involved in this for 
many years and has played a huge role 
in the success of the FDA, which is, as 
we know, one of the extraordinarily 
successful agencies in the Federal Government. 
It gives the American people 
confidence, when they go into a grocery 
store and purchase food or when 
they go into a pharmacy and purchase 
a pharmaceutical product or have a 
prescription filled, that they are going 
to receive goods which are safe and effective 
and that they are not going to 
be at risk of harm as a result of adulteration, 
fraud, abuse, or misuse of 
those goods. 

It is one of the most amazing successes 
of our Federal Government in 
the area of protecting consumers. It 
arose out of the early 1900 period when 
there were serious issues relative to 
food safety in this country, and has 
evolved into clearly one of the finest 
agencies, not only in our Government 
but in the world. It is respected around 
the world as the gold standard for protecting 
American citizens and citizens 
who use the products made by American 
companies. 

This bill builds on that success. I 
congratulate the Senator from Massachusetts 
and the Senator from Wyoming 
for doing such a strong job of 
building on that success. This bill continues 
the effort to make sure we have 

a prompt but safe procedure for getting 
drugs approved in this country, something 
called PDUFA, which basically 
allows drug companies to pay a fairly 
significant portion of the cost of the 
approval of new drugs, which has expedited 
dramatically the rate of approval 
of new drugs. That means pharmaceuticals 
and biologics come to the 
market, which help people, which save 
lives, which basically makes life better. 
That is the good news. 

In addition, there is, for devices, the 
MDUFMA proposals, which deal with 
devices, medical devices the way we 
deal with pharmaceuticals, setting up a 
fee system for the approval of medical 
devices. This is something, when I was 
chairman of this committee, I had the 
good fortune to be involved in developing. 
These two initiatives are the essence 
of how we maintain a vibrant 
drug and medical device approval process 
in this country. It is absolutely 
critical they be reauthorized, and this 
bill does it in an effective way. 

In addition, the bill takes on a number 
of other issues which are timely 
and appropriate. The most significant, 
from my perspective, although there 
are a lot of significant ones here, is the 
issue of drug safety and how we make 
sure the drugs which do come to the 
market are safe. This involves not 
guesswork but finding out what the 
science is and what happens when people 
start using these drugs and medical 
devices. The concept behind that in 
this bill is that we should set up a regime 
that basically collects information 
from all sorts of different sources. 
There are literally thousands of different 
sources, but there are some very 
big ones that we develop information 
about the reactions people have when 
they take drugs. We have the tremendous 
database of the Medicare system, 
for example. We have the tremendous 
database of provider groups, such as 
the Kaiser Permanente fund out in 
California. These different provider 
groups have a huge amount of information 
on what is happening when somebody 
takes some form of medication. 
But what happens is that information, 
although it is collected, is not effectively 
screened and is not effectively 
evaluated. 

What this bill does, essentially, is 
create a regime that allows us to more 
effectively, first, collect the data; second, 
when there are red flags popping 
up on that data that say there is a reaction 
here or reaction there or something 
occurs here that was not expected, 
that information becomes more 
visible under this regime and more 
available; and then, third, if it is clear 
there is something that is not going 
right here, that there is a series of aberrations 
nobody expected, then it sets 
up a process where we take that information 
out and we give it to selected 
groups of specialists in the academic 
and private world who have the ability 
to evaluate that information and tell 
us what is going on. 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5373 

There are centers at MIT and I believe 
at Duke, for example, that do exactly 
this. The idea, of course, is to 
first collect the information effectively; 
second, make sure when those 
aberrations or red flags start to show 
up they are noted; and, third, when 
there is a certain critical mass of information 
that reflects something that 
may not be correct or is out of kilter, 
it makes sure we have that information 
evaluated in a very science-based, 
professional way by people who specialize 
in this and who have the ability 
to do it—something which FDA does 
not have the resources, necessarily, to 
do right now. 

With that information in hand, with 
that science in hand, then you can 
make decisions. This bill creates a new 
regime for making those decisions—as 
to what a company must tell people or 
tell providers when they are using 
these different drugs and medications. 
But it will be a science-based decision, 
and that is the key here. All of this 
will key off of science that is hard and 
that is effectively reviewed and evaluated 
in order to come to the conclusion 
that certain actions must be taken in 
how you distribute this medication and 
how you communicate what the implications 
of this medication are. So this 
new safety and surveillance regime, 
which is known as mining the information, 
and then pulling it together and 
taking advantage of it, validating it 
and integrating it—this new regime is 
at the essence of the safety concerns 
which are involved in this bill. 

It is very positive. It opens a new 
world of review in the area of pharmaceuticals 
and medicines, a postmarket 
review process which will be based on 
science and which will be very healthy 
to the system as a whole. I congratulate 
and thank both Senator KENNEDY 
and Senator ENZI for evolving this 
process in this bill. 

In addition, there is the pediatric 
language in this bill. There is the BSE 
program, which is the program which 
basically rewards companies that are 
willing to go out and do extra research 
to see how a drug might affect a child. 
Historically, drugs will be brought to 
the market and you would never 
know—because all the clinical exams 
have been done on adults—how they 
would affect children. Some of these 
drugs, obviously, if given to a child, 
could have a significant negative impact 
and, if given in the wrong doses, 
might have an extraordinarily adverse 
effect. Some could actually be very 
positive if given in the right dosage. So 
it became a guessing game as to when 
these pharmaceuticals, when these 
medications, were good for children, in 
many instances. As a result, doctors 
and prescribers simply didn’t know 
whether to make them available, in 
many instances, to children. 

This BSE pharmaceutical procedure 
said essentially, We will give you, the 
producer of this pharmaceutical, of 
this medication—we will give you an 
extra 6 months of exclusivity in ex


change for your testing this and making 
sure it will work effectively, or 
finding out if it will not work effectively, 
on children. The practical effect 
of that, of giving that incentive, has 
been that hundreds of new drugs have 
been made available to children which 
were not available before. This has had 
a very positive impact on children and 
the ability of children to get pharmaceuticals. 


With the BSE program, we also developed 
a program called the Pediatric 
Research Equity Act, which essentially 
takes the opposite approach from the 
BSE program. It creates a mandate 
where, in certain instances, certain 
medications have to be tested on children. 
They have to go through a process 
of seeing if they will work for children. 
The two together basically work 
in tandem and the idea is they will feed 
off of each other, and you will create 
an atmosphere out there where the two 
different approaches—one basically 
being a carrot and the other being a 
stick—will lead to better medications 
being available for children. 

It has worked amazingly well. The 
key to this, of course, is to keep these 
two in tandem. In order to accomplish 
that, they both, in my opinion—and 
fortunately in the opinion of the chairman 
and the ranking member of the 
committee now, at least—have to be on 
the same wavelength. They have to be 
dealt with the same way relative to 
things such as their sunsets, when they 
get reviewed and when they don’t get 
reviewed, because if you were to have 
one sunsetted at a different time than 
the other or one sunset and the other 
not sunset, you wouldn’t get an effective 
review of the two together, and 
they both work, as I said, together. 

This bill makes sure they are treated 
the same way in that area, and that is 
a major step in the right direction toward 
making sure children get proper 
pediatric care. There is still going to be 
an issue tomorrow, I understand, on exclusivity, 
which is going to be brought 
up by another Senator; that is, the 
length of the exclusivity that is necessary 
in order to get pharmaceutical 
companies to pursue proper research on 
children is an issue. But I happen to 
think what we have now has been 
shown to work, and why fix something 
that is not broken, in my opinion. So I 
believe we should stay with what we 
have for the 6-month exclusivity period. 


In addition, there are a number of 
other issues floating around this bill. 
This bill, obviously being a major 
health care bill, attracts a lot of other 
concerns. One of them that I have filed 
as an amendment—but I don’t intend 
to bring it up unless we move into the 
issue of reimportation, which may be 
brought up on the floor—is the question 
of safety of Internet pharmacies. I 
believe very strongly, when somebody 
goes on line and purchases a pharmaceutical 
product over the Internet— 
which is happening more and more 
often as people become more com


fortable with dealing with the Internet 
on a variety of different levels, but certainly 
senior citizens as people age into 
their senior citizenship years who had 
been dealing with the Internet for 
quite a few years and are comfortable 
with it—I believe it is critical we have 
in place a system which allows people, 
when they look at the site on the 
Internet, to know whether that Internet 
pharmacy is selling the product 
they say they are selling and whether 
the product they say they are selling 
has received FDA approval. 

The problem we have here is a lot of 
these pharmacies will represent that 
they are selling some sort of pharmaceutical 
good and it turns out that 
product is, in many cases, adulterated 
or inappropriately made, in which case 
people end up getting a pharmaceutical 
product which is bad for them. In some 
cases it can actually lead to death. So 
it is critical that we have a way so 
when somebody goes on the Internet 
and looks at a site on the Internet, 
they know that Internet pharmacy 
they are looking at is legitimate and 
the products they sell are legitimate 
and have been through the FDA approval 
process. 

In order to accomplish that, we need 
to set up a whole new regime, basically, 
and we need to pay for it. This 
amendment which I have put in accomplishes 
that. It essentially gives the 
FDA the authority to review pharmacy 
sites on line, to meet with the people 
who have set up those sites, to make 
sure to set up a certification process 
where they are guaranteed the sites are 
meeting the conditions of selling pharmaceutical 
products or medications 
which have met the FDA approval, and 
then to put sort of a Good Housekeeping 
seal on that site, which is 
tamperproof, which says this site has 
FDA-approved products. It would be a 
huge step forward in safety for American 
citizens using Internet pharmacies. 


It is complicated, though, in its enforcement. 
It is simple to state but 
complicated to enforce because it 
means the FDA needs the resources to 
deal with these sites and also to deal 
directly with these pharmaceutical 
Internet sales places which may be 
somewhere other than the United 
States. Second, you have to have in the 
United States a point at which you can 
deal with the site if something goes 
wrong, a responsible representative on 
the ground in the United States who 
has the economic wherewithal to basically 
bond the site, for all intents and 
purposes. 

Setting up that type of regime will 
be expensive. The language of this 
amendment puts in place a fee system 
which allows that to be paid for so we 
can be assured that the FDA has the 
resources necessary to review these 
sites and accomplish this goal of making 
sure these Internet pharmacy sites 
are safe for Americans to use. I think 
this would be a tremendous step forward 
in safety for all Americans, especially 
as we move toward a much more 


S5374 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

Internet-oriented purchasing process in 
this country. 

Another issue which is going to be 
discussed here, and which I understand 
from the chairman may be held over 
for conference or come into play in 
some area, is a crucial issue of follow-
on biologics or similar biologics. 

We know we can produce a generic 
pharmaceutical and do it with a fair 
amount of predictability. We know 
that if a generic company brings on a 
pharmaceutical product which has run 
its course, it has proper patent coverage, 
that that generic is going to be 
safe and effective and be essentially 
the same thing as the pharmaceutical 
because they are chemical compounds. 

In the biologics area, this is not the 
case because you are dealing with a 
much more complex process of producing 
the biological medication. It is 
a fermentation process, it involves proteins, 
it involves mutation of proteins, 
which depends to a great extent on a 
huge number of factors which are very 
uniquely identified with the way that 
that vat of medication was evolved 
through the process. 

Anyone who has been to one of these 
facilities can see how complex it is to 
maintain consistency, even within the 
facility that is producing the medication. 
If you stepped out of that facility 
and tried to reproduce that medication, 
the complexities would even be more 
difficult to replicate. 

It is critical that as we move into 
this biologic area, we understand we 
are not dealing with generic pharmaceuticals. 
You know, when you put the 
title ‘‘generic pharmaceuticals’’ on 
something that is sort of a motherhood 
term, that is a good idea. It is a good 
idea if it works. But if you put the generic 
title on biologics, you are probably 
going to mislead a lot of people 
and, in the process, potentially produce 
medicines which can be extremely 
harmful or could not accomplish the 
purposes. 

So as we move down this road of 
looking at biologics and how we give 
the opportunity to produce similar biologics 
to people after the patent life 
has run, we have to be very careful 
that we don’t oversimplify the exercise 
in the name of getting something, as 
‘‘motherhoodish’’ as generics; rather, 
we have to make sure we put in place 
a process which allows those biologics, 
when they are produced as similar biologics, 
to have been properly reviewed 
to be sure they accomplish what they 
claim they are going to accomplish. 

This means that almost in every instance 
of an individual biologic, you 
are going to have to have clinical trials 
for the similar biologic. There are 
going to be very rare instances where 
you can actually bring to the market 
something that doesn’t go through 
clinical trials in this area, in my opinion, 
and you have to be very sure that 
you demonstrate safety and effectiveness 
of the similar product before you 
step into this arena of awarding the authority 
to go ahead and sell that product 
in the market generally. 

You will also need very aggressive 
postmarket surveillance in this area 
because you do not know, in many instances—
you hope you know, but you 
do not necessarily know—how individuals 
will react to taking this type of 
medication, which is developed as a 
similar medication, as versus the basic 
medication which is trying to be replicated. 


This area of biologics is a complex 
one. It should not be rushed into. I 
know there is a great desire to step forward 
and say: We have a huge victory 
for the American people, we can now 
have generic biologics. But if we rush 
into this exercise and create a process 
with approval which does not adequately 
account for the significantly, 
the exponentially more complex process 
of bringing online a biologic when 
compared to a chemical pharmaceutical, 
then we will not have done 
our job as policy people but will simply 
have given ourselves a good press release 
and in the end probably have 
given ourselves a very dangerous process 
relevant to protecting the American 
people in the area of biologics. 

As we move down this road of 
generics, I do hope we will move in a 
way that understands there is a significant 
difference in pharmaceuticals and 
that those differences are going to require 
a much more detailed and a much 
more complex approval process than we 
presently have in moving in the generic 
pharmaceutical area. 

Those are some of the concerns I 
have relative to other issues that 
might be brought up in this bill. But I 
do again wish to congratulate the Senator 
from Wyoming, I wish to congratulate 
the chairman from Massachusetts 
for once again bringing to the 
floor a very strong piece of legislation, 
which will significantly improve the 
capacity of the FDA to continue its extraordinary 
record of protecting the 
American people relevant to food and 
drug safety. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Wyoming is recognized. 

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to 
thank the Senator from New Hampshire, 
Mr. GREGG, for the tremendous 
effort he put into this bill. He spent 
years on the committee. He became 
chairman of the committee. He used 
those years with the institutional 
memory and the experience with a 
great deal of diligence and creativity 
which he has always used on that committee 
to provide us with fuller explanations 
and wording for several of the 
provisions that are in this bill. 

I thank him for helping us to perfect 
those and the diligence he always has 
on all of the issues we bring up in the 
committee. I also appreciate the work 
he has done on Internet safety. This is 
not something he just developed now. 
He has been working on it for at least 
3 years that I am aware, to make that 
as safe a system as possible if we ever 
have to put it into place. 

I am hoping we will not have to have 
that full debate at this time and appre


ciate his submitting it in case we need 
to have that debate. 

I also appreciate the explanation he 
gave on the follow-on biologics. It is a 
hard thing for people on the committee 
who have been through a number of 
hearings to understand. I am sure the 
public as a whole has an even greater 
difficulty with it. But it is a whole new 
phase of medications. By the name, 
‘‘biologics,’’ it is alive. That makes it a 
lot more complicated than a set of 
chemicals that are ground up and put 
together in a particular order. Even 
with the chemicals that are ground up 
and put together in a particular order, 
if they aren’t done quite right, they 
would not dissolve and people do not 
get any benefit from them. That is why 
we are doing the bill. Then we will be 
working on biologic similars to see if 
there is some way that that can be 
done effectively and safely. I thank the 
Senator for his comments and his tremendous 
work. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Massachusetts. 

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I 
would add a note of thanks to the Senator 
as well. We are strongly committed 
to information technology, the 
use of information technology eventually. 
We have that on our list. We 
passed it unanimously through this 
body a couple of years ago, but the 
House didn’t act and we are going to 
act further. 

But what we are talking about in the 
database, which the Senator from New 
Hampshire talked about, is using the 
information technology and database 
in terms of the postmarketing or approval 
surveillance. This makes a great 
deal of sense. That is a key aspect of 
safety in the legislation. The Senator 
from New Hampshire is very interested 
in shaping that. 

The second is to make sure we are 
going to bring the latest information 
on drug safety to the consumers; that 
is more scattered at the present time 
than it should be. 

We have accepted the recommendation 
of Senator GREGG to include one 
what they call portal in the Internet to 
make sure that that information will 
be collected and available to the consumers 
on safety, which is a useful addition. 
So these are important. I thank 
him for his strong support for this legislation. 
This is very helpful. 

Now we are beginning to see, we have 
got broad support on our side and on 
both sides of the aisle for this legislation. 
We are working hard to clear up 
some of the—still a few of the outstanding 
items, but we are moving 
ahead. We want to indicate to our colleagues 
again that we want to try and 
respond to many of their amendments, 
but we want to do it in a timely way. 
We were in here yesterday afternoon 
with the presentation. We welcomed 
suggestions during the course of the 
evening last night, and we have done so 
during the course of the day. We are 
moving along we hope that anyone who 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5375 

has any other further amendments 
would be in close touch with us because 
we are giving every opportunity to our 
colleagues to make any recommendations 
they have or would like to move 
along to conclusion at a reasonably 
swift time. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Louisiana. 

AMENDMENT NO. 1004 

Ms. LANDRIEU. Taking that advice 
to heart, Mr. President, I call up 
amendment No. 1004. 

I would like to speak about that 
amendment now. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will report. 

The legislative clerk read as follows: 

The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. 

LANDRIEU] proposes an amendment numbered 
1004. 

The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To require the Food and Drug Ad


ministration to permit the sale of baby 

turtles as pets so long as the seller uses 

proven methods to effectively treat sal


monella) 

At the end of the bill, add the following: 

TITLE ll—DOMESTIC PET TURTLE 

MARKET ACCESS 

SEC. ll. SHORT TITLE. 

This title may be cited as the ‘‘Domestic 
Pet Turtle Market Access Act of 2007’’. 
SEC. ll. FINDINGS. 

Congress makes the following findings: 

(1) Pet turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in 
diameter have been banned for sale in the 
United States by the Food and Drug Administration 
since 1975 due to health concerns. 
(2) The Food and Drug Administration does 
not ban the sale of iguanas or other lizards, 
snakes, frogs, or other amphibians or reptiles 
that are sold as pets in the United 
States that also carry salmonella bacteria. 
The Food and Drug Administration also does 
not require that these animals be treated for 
salmonella bacteria before being sold as pets. 
(3) The technology to treat turtles for salmonella, 
and make them safe for sale, has 
greatly advanced since 1975. Treatments 
exist that can nearly eradicate salmonella 
from turtles, and individuals are more aware 
of the causes of salmonella, how to treat salmonella 
poisoning, and the seriousness associated 
with salmonella poisoning. 
(4) University research has shown that 
these turtles can be treated in such a way 
that they can be raised, shipped, and distributed 
without having a recolonization of salmonella. 
(5) University research has also shown that 
pet owners can be equipped with a treatment 
regiment that allows the turtle to be maintained 
safe from salmonella. 
(6) The Food and Drug Administration 
should allow the sale of turtles less than 10.2 
centimeters in diameter as pets as long as 
the sellers are required to use proven methods 
to treat these turtles for salmonella. 
SEC. ll. SALE OF BABY TURTLES. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, the Food and Drug Administration shall 
not restrict the sale by a turtle farmer, or 
wholesaler commercial retail seller of a turtle 
that is less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter 
as a pet if— 

(1) the State or territory in which such 
farmer is located has developed a regulatory 
process by which pet turtle farmers are required 
to have a State license to breed, 
hatch, propagate, raise, grow, receive, ship, 
transport, export, or sell pet turtles or pet 
turtle eggs; 
(2) such State or territory requires certification 
of sanitization that is signed by a veterinarian 
who is licensed in the State or territory, 
and approved by the State or territory 
agency in charge of regulating the sale 
of pet turtles; 
(3) the certification of sanitization requires 
each turtle to be sanitized or treated 
for diseases, including salmonella, and is dependant 
upon using the Siebeling method, or 
other such proven method, which uses an antibiotic 
to make the turtle salmonella-free; 
and 
(4) the turtle farmer or commercial retail 
seller includes, with the sale of such a turtle, 
a disclosure to the buyer that includes— 
(A) information regarding— 
(i) the possibility that salmonella can re-
colonize in turtles; 
(ii) the dangers, including possible severe 
illness or death, especially for at-risk people 
who may be susceptible to salmonella poisoning, 
such as children, pregnant women, 
and others who may have weak immune systems, 
that could result if the turtle is not 
properly handled and safely maintained; 
(iii) the proper handling of the turtle, including 
an explanation of proper hygiene 
such as handwashing after handling a turtle; 
and 
(iv) the proven methods of treatment that, 
if properly applied, keep the turtle safe from 
salmonella; 
(B) a detailed explanation of how to properly 
treat the turtle to keep it safe from salmonella, 
using the proven methods of treatment 
referred to under subparagraph (A), 
and how the buyer can continue to purchase 
the tools, treatments, or any other required 
item to continually treat the turtle; and 
(C) a statement that buyers of pet turtles 
should not abandon the turtle or abandon it 
outside, as the turtle may become an 
invasive species to the local community, but 
should instead return them to a commercial 
retail pet seller or other organization that 
would accept turtles no longer wanted as 
pets. 
(b) FDA REVIEW OF STATE PROTECTIONS.— 
The Food and Drug Administration may, 
after providing an opportunity for the affected 
State to respond, restrict the sale of a 
turtle only if the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services determines, that the actual 
implementation State health protections described 
in subsection (a) are insufficient to 
protect consumers against infectious diseases 
acquired from such turtles at the time 
of sale. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Louisiana is recognized. 

Ms. LANDRIEU. This amendment, I 
will discuss briefly at this time, and 
then according to the leaders on how 
they would like to go ahead and proceed 
with these amendments, it can be 
voted on at another time. 

Mr. President, sometimes we offer 
amendments that affect large industries 
and millions and millions of people 
in large industries. Sometimes they 
are smaller industries but very important 
industries that we have to stand 
for as well. 

One of them is a small, relatively 
small industry in my State. That is the 
industry of turtle farmers who grow 
and produce and trade and sell turtles 
to be used in a variety of different 
ways. One of the ways is by selling 
them for pets. In 1975, the FDA banned 
the sale of small turtles for pets domestically 
but allowed those sales to 
continue internationally. 

So there is a group of farmers, turtle 
farmers, in Louisiana particularly, but 
I am sure there are others around the 
country, who have maintained their 
business by selling overseas. Recently, 
because of the competition and development 
of overseas markets, they are 
getting very constricted in what they 
can sell because they have now gotten 
competition from the countries in 
which most of these sales occur. 

There has been a great deal of pressure 
to try to reopen the domestic market. 
That is what this amendment will 
do. It will open a domestic market 
again because the science has caught 
up with the regulations. We now have 
developed a vaccine, universally-tested 
and proven, that can keep those small 
turtles nearly free of salmonella, and 
with the right licensing procedures this 
amendment calls for and the right information 
that is required when these 
turtles are sold for pets, either to a 
wholesaler or retailer or to a family 
who might purchase them, I believe the 
safeguards are in place, as the science 
and technology have caught up with 
the problem. 

There are many wonderful aspects 
about technology. Sometimes we can 
think our way through a problem. That 
is basically what has been done over 
the last 35 years. I am proud of the role 
that LSU, Louisiana State University, 
has played in developing these treatments. 
I am proud the industry survived 
through a very difficult time and 
proud they are now proposing very 
strict rules and regulations. 

I might add that when this ban went 
into place for this particular reptile, 
there was no such ban for other reptiles 
that also can carry salmonella, 
which are still continuing to be sold on 
the domestic market. So on behalf of 
this industry, which is small but important, 
mainly in Louisiana, and I am 
certain there are turtle farmers in 
many places, I offer this amendment to 
repeal this 1975 ban in light of the new 
technology and new opportunities that 
are out there to give protection to our 
general public. 

That is the essence of the amendment. 
I would like to set it aside now 
and speak to it at a later time when 
votes are scheduled. 

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 
thank the Senator. 

We are reviewing the proposal. I understand 
the State of Louisiana has 
had a very strong regulatory process in 
terms of safety, which has been recognized 
and commended for some period 
of time. 

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the 
Senator is correct, because I understand, 
as I am learning more about this 
industry, it is more robust in the State 
of Louisiana than elsewhere. So I think 
our legislature has put the appropriate 
restrictions, licensing, information, as 
well as keeping the research going, 
that could develop the appropriate 
ways to treat these reptiles so we can 
maintain an industry, allow people to 
make a living, and keep our population 
safe as well. 


S5376 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I 
thank the Senator. We are reviewing 
the proposal. We will work very closely 
with the Senator, and we will be back 
in touch making a recommendation, 
working with her. We thank the Senator 
very much. 

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I 
thank the Senator from Massachusetts. 

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 

Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of S. 1082, the Food and Drug 
Administration Revitalization Act. 

This legislation addresses many critical 
issues, including the need for provide 
proper incentives and support for 
the development and review of pharmaceuticals 
and medical devices, including 
products for children, and the need 
for heightened efforts to assure the 
safety of medications. 

As we debate this legislation, let us 
remember we all have the same goals 
in mind. 

We want Americans to benefit from 
life-saving, life-enhancing drug and device 
products. 

We want Americans to have access to 
drugs that are safe and effective. 

We want Americans to have all the 
relevant safety information available 
on their drugs. 

And, indeed, we want Americans to 
know that the Food and Drug Administration, 
the agency responsible for ensuring 
drug and device safety, has the 
resources to do its job. 

That is what this bill is all about 
protecting Americans and giving the 
FDA the tools to do its job. 

The legislation before us reauthorizes 
both the Prescription Drug User Fee 
Act, better known as PDUFA, and the 
Medical Device User Modernization Fee 
Act, better known as MDUFMA. 

It is of critical importance that both 
programs be authorized by the end of 
the fiscal year. This legislation embodies 
the agreements reached by both 
industries and the FDA, along with refinements 
added by the Congress. 

Let me make clear that I am supportive 
of these reauthorizations. It is 
fair to say that I had reservations 
about PDUFA when it was enacted in 
1992, questioning the wisdom of whether 
an industry should be required to 
support a governmental function. To a 
certain extent, I still have those reservations. 
That being said, it has become 
abundantly clear that there are 
not the resources in the Agriculture 
Appropriations bill to support these review 
functions absent a user fee, and 
thus I recognize their necessity. 

With regard to MDUFMA, I have 
been particularly concerned about the 
impact that user fees could have on 
small medical device manufacturers, 
many of which are located in Utah. Indeed, 
I am proud that there are over 100 
medical device companies in Utah, 
companies that represent the best in 

American innovation. They are true 
world leaders in their industry. 

The changes made in the last reauthorization 
at my request, along with 
the new structure of the user fee in 
FDARA and the improved trigger provision 
satisfy me that the manufacturers 
are being fairly treated by the user 
fee program in this bill. And, indeed, 
this is a serious concern. 

In February of 2006, the Lewin Group 
prepared a report for the FDA entitled 
‘‘Medical Device Industry Perspectives 
on MDUFMA. That report revealed 
that senior industry experts felt FDA 
is generally doing an excellent job in 
premarket regulation of medical devices 
and that the industry was generally 
supportive of the purpose and 
goals of MDUFMA. However, key 
among the findings was the fact that 
the industry perceived little or no evidence 
of attaining the main intent of 
the program or in realizing a favorable 
return on investment from user fees. In 
fact, whenever I return to Utah to 
meet with medical device executives, I 
hear the same concern. And it is a concern 
I share. 

Indicative of that concern is the astounding 
fact that 70 percent of responding 
device manufacturers perceived 
that MDUFMA goals have not 
resulted in meaningful improvements 
in either the predictability or timeliness 
of reviews. In fact, when I reviewed 
the device approval times, I understood 
those concerns. For some 
classes of devices, FDA had made great 
progress. For others not. This was disturbing 
to me, since we would all hope 
that progress would have been made 
across the board. 

It is my hope with the new fee structure 
embodied in S. 1082, we will make 
better progress in achieving the approval 
time goals. I am pleased that 
Chairman KENNEDY and Senator ENZI 
included provisions at my request 
which make certain the fees for smaller 
companies are affordable. 

Let me turn to the issue of direct-to-
consumer advertising, or DTC. This is 
an issue on which our colleague, the 
senior Senator from Kansas, Mr. PAT 
ROBERTS, has shown great leadership, 
both in the HELP Committee, and here 
in the Senate Chamber. Senator ROBERTS 
has led the charge to eliminate 
the 2-year moratorium on prescription 
advertising for newly approved drugs. 
He has expressed constitutional concerns 
about such a moratorium. I share 
those concerns. He is right to bring 
this up. 

In general, I believe we should be 
guided by a very simple rule. Advertising 
about products the FDA regulates 
should be truthful and not misleading. 


I do understand the arguments that 
some in this body make with respect to 
pharmaceutical advertising. Some 
nights, when I watch television, those 
ads do become tiresome. But I could 
say that about a lot of ads. 

Some have argued we need to be particularly 
careful about what pharma


ceutical advertising is allowed, because 
we have limited knowledge about 
drugs, especially when they come on 
the market. 

Those who make such arguments fail 
to recognize that FDARA will guarantee 
that consumers have access to 
greater clinical and safety information 
about medications because it gives the 
FDA more authority to review and 
react to drug safety data. User fees created 
by S. 1082 will bolster the FDA office 
responsible for reviewing drug advertisements. 


The FDA has told my office and others 
that drug manufacturers cooperate 
fully with the FDA when a concern is 
raised about an advertisement. That 
would be my preference for how these 
ads should be handled. 

I am hopeful we will be able to address 
this issue and I am encouraged by 
recent discussions involving the Senator 
from Kansas and others members 
of the Senate HELP Committee. 

The bill’s drug safety provisions are 
probably its most important component. 
Indeed, shortly after the Institute 
of Medicine issued its report on 
this issue, we all began to see a floor of 
letters in support of efforts to improve 
the drug safety program. 

Members of the HELP Committee undertook 
serious discussions on how to 
address the problems that have been 
identified, and the result is this legislation 
developed by Senator ENZI and 
Chairman KENNEDY. The Enzi-Kennedy 
bill has benefited from the guidance of 
our colleagues, former Chairman 
GREGG and Senator BURR, who have 
pointed out the necessity for more 
flexibility in determining when a risk 
evaluation mitigation plan—or 
REMS—is needed. Senator COBURN 
added greatly to the discussion by raising 
issues relating to the access of our 
constituents in rural areas to needed 
pharmaceuticals. 

I believe the product of these discussions 
strikes the appropriate balance. 
It requires, for example, that determining 
whether the FDA should further 
assess the safety of a drug should 
be based on scientific evidence. To me, 
that is probably the most integral part 
of this bill—when concerns are raised 
about drugs, these concerns must be 
based on scientific evidence and not on 
innuendos or hearsay. This approach 
allows proper evaluation of relevant information 
and gives the FDA greater 
authority to warn consumers when 
there are problems. 

In addition, the drug safety title 
strengthens the FDA’s existing authority 
to monitor drugs once they have 
been approved by making it clear that 
evaluation must occur before and after 
approval. One of the most important 
components of this legislation is that 
more drug safety information will be 
made more available to the public. I 
believe that is an important victory for 
the American consumer. 

I also want to take a few minutes to 
talk about the pediatric testing and research 
provisions included in this bill. 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5377 

I have supported both the Best Pharmaceuticals 
for Children Act and the 
Pediatric Research Improvement Act. 
In fact, I have supported these efforts 
since our former colleague from Ohio, 
Senator MIKE DEWINE, brought the 
need for additional pediatric testing of 
prescription drugs to our attention 
during consideration of the FDA Modernization 
Act of 1997. He fought long 
and hard to encourage drug companies 
to conduct clinical trials on pediatric 
uses of their drugs. His efforts paid off 
and this program has been extremely 
successful. 

My good friend and colleague from 
Connecticut, subcommittee Chairman 
CHRIS DODD, has also shown great leadership 
on this issue when FDAMA was 
being considered in 1997. He held a 
hearing on this issue earlier this year 
with his ranking Republican member, 
Senator LAMAR ALEXANDER. That hearing 
was very insightful and I believe 
that many of us are trying to do the 
right thing as we reauthorize both programs. 


I urge my colleagues not to lose sight 
of the purpose of these two programs as 
we make decisions on this part of the 
bill. We want good, solid information 
about the safest way to prescribe drugs 
for children. And by giving companies 
market exclusivity to conduct clinical 
trials, we will know the safest dosage 
levels for children. So let us not lose 
sight of the original propose of these 
programs—to help children have the 
safest dosages for prescriptions. I am 
hopeful that we will be able to work 
out our differences on these provisions 
on these very important issues. 

Food safety is another issue that is 
on nearly everyone’s mind these days. 
When I was a kid, we were always told 
to eat our spinach so we could grow 
muscles like Popeye. Peanut butter is 
almost a staple for most Americans. 
And yet these ordinary, common foods 
have harmed rather than helped. Pets 
are getting sick and we have discovered 
that their food has been contaminated. 
Something needs to be done. 

I have worked with Senators KENNEDY, 
ENZI, DURBIN and ALLARD to figure 
out a constructive approach to 
these important issues. I think that we 
have made a lot of progress and I look 
forward continuing those discussions 
as the bill progresses toward enactment. 


One factor that is not discussed 
enough is the need to appropriate more 
funding for inspectors and inspector 
training, especially abroad. I can recall 
over a decade though when Jim Phillips, 
a former investigator for the FDA, 
brought to our attention the woefully 
lacking FDA resources for foreign inspections. 
We were shocked then, and 
unfortunately, we are shocked now. 

Today, only one percent of imported 
food is inspected. I believe this issue 
needs to be carefully reviewed by Congress 
so people no longer have to worry 
about whether food for them or their 
pets is safe. 

I offered and withdrew an amendment 
during the HELP Committee con


sideration of this bill that would address 
another important issue. My 
amendment had several provisions 
which encouraged innovation and development 
of safe antibiotics, required 
the FDA to convene a meeting to determine 
how the Orphan Drug Act 
should be applied to antibiotics, and reauthorized 
the grant programs for the 
Orphan Drug Act. Finally, my amendment 
provided for a 5-year exclusivity 
for enantiomers of previously approved 
racemic drugs if and only if, one, they 
are approved for new therapeutic uses 
and, two, a completely new data set 
has been created for approval of this 
enantiomer. It is my expectation that 
our current discussions on these provisions 
will lead toward their adoption 
later in the week. 

I also want to point out that there 
have been many discussions on ways to 
ensure that citizens’ petitions do not 
unfairly delay generic drug approvals. I 
believe this is a problem, although I do 
not believe it is of a magnitude as some 
would suggest. I do not oppose making 
changes to ensure that any abuses in 
this area are stopped, as long as FDA 
still has the ability to do the appropriate 
scientific and legal review of abbreviated 
new drug approval applications 
in the timeframe it desires. 

Let me turn now to one provision 
which is not in the bill: language authorizing 
a pathway for the Food and 
Drug Administration to approve copies 
of biologics. This is commonly referred 
to as the ‘‘biosimilars,’’ ‘‘biogenerics,’’ 
or ‘‘follow-on biologics’’ legislation. 
Senator GREGG spoke so well about 
this subject just a few minutes ago. 

While language on this issue is not 
included in the bill we consider today, 
I want to make perfectly clear that it 
is my intention to work toward development 
of an acceptable compromise 
that can be included in the final 
version of FDARA and signed into law. 
It is my hope Senators will refrain 
from offering any amendments on this 
issue until we have time to develop 
consensus. And I do believe consensus 
can be developed without delay. It is 
my intention to do so. 

As my colleagues are aware, I am the 
Hatch of Hatch-Waxman. I have a serious 
interest in making certain the law 
Chairman WAXMAN and I developed in 
1984, the Drug Price Competition and 
Patent Term Restoration Act, is used 
as the basis for development of legislation 
to provide an abbreviated pathway 
for approval of follow-on biological 
products. In so doing, we must make 
certain we include the appropriate incentives 
for development of those products. 
Indeed, that is my high priority. 

By any estimate, the Hatch-Waxman 
law has done consumers tremendous 
good by fostering today’s modern generic 
drug industry. It has saved patients 
literally billions of dollars. 
Similarly, using it as a basis for development 
of a pathway for follow-on biologics 
will help consumers with access 
to the innovative, life-affirming biologic 
products. But in so doing, we 

must be mindful of the fact that we 
need to encourage and nurture the innovation 
that provides the biologics 
that the generic companies seek to 
copy. This is a tremendously complicated 
task, but it is one worth 
doing. 

In 1984, when Chairman WAXMAN and 
I undertook a series of negotiations 
that led to approval of the Drug Price 
Competition and Patent Term Restoration 
Act, it was a very different time. 

There were no cell phones, no DVDs, 
almost no one had a personal computer, 
and a stamp cost 20 cents 

It was a much less complicated time. 
Generic drugs were a small, struggling 
industry, with no discernible footprint 
in the pharmaceutical world. The 
innovators had yet to respond to their 
first paragraph IV certification. In 
1984, brands versus generics largely an 
American endeavor. Today, the pharmaceutical 
market—both innovator 
and generic—is an international mark-
er—for research, development and marketing. 


Biological products were not an issue 
in 1984. Today, they are becoming an 
increasingly larger part of pharmaceutical 
spending. 

It is my strong belief that we can 
learn from this experience and build 
another solid law that will help consumers—
both by supporting the incentive 
to discover and develop new biologics, 
and by fostering a climate that 
will lead to lower prices. This is a classic 
win-win situation. 

And why is that so important? 

A February report by the Center for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services paints 
the picture very well: America’s health 
care spending in the next 10 years will 
double to $4.1 trillion. Or, to look at it 
another way, that is 20 cents out of 
every dollar spent. We spend about 
$7,500 per capita on health care in the 

U.S. Yet in 2016, that will rise to an astounding 
$12,800 per person. Greater 
spending for pharmaceuticals is expected 
to fuel much of the increase, the 
report’s authors concluded. 
And there it is in a nutshell. The 
good news and the bad news. 

Not much worries Congress more 
than the costs of medical care—both 
from the perspective of a balanced 
budget, and from the view of our constituents’ 
pocketbooks. 

In many ways, it is an embarrassment 
of riches. 

We have exciting new therapies to 
treat our medical ills—new drugs, new 
devices, stem cell treatments. Their 
potential to improve human health and 
well-being is almost limitless. 

And yet the cost of those treatments, 
the impact they have on the budget, at 
times seems equally limitless. In fact, 
in 2005, prescription drug spending was 
estimated at $214 billion, a healthy 
amount by anyone’s measure. That 
same year, spending on biologics was 
estimated at $32 billion. 

Since biologicals are generally more 
expensive products, ways to reduce 
their costs interest policymakers and 


S5378 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

other stakeholders in expenditure of 
the health care dollar, foremost among 
them employers, insurers, pharmacy 
benefits managers, and of course, the 
government. 

Comes now the generic drug industry, 
which has been proven to provide 
alternative, safe and effective therapies 
in a much more cost beneficial 
manner. We look to them to be part of 
the solution to this problem. And they, 
in turn, look to us to help them be part 
of that solution. 

It is no secret that several senators 
have been meeting to develop a bill 
that would establish a pathway for biosimilar 
products to be approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration. We had 
hoped to have it ready for inclusion in 
FDARA, but it was not, despite the 
talks of the four Senators. I am referring 
to Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions Committee Chairman TED 
KENNEDY, the committee’s ranking Republican, 
MIKE ENZI, Senator HILLARY 
CLINTON, and me. All members of the 
HELP Committee, we have worked to 
develop consensus on what legislation 
would include. 

Senator KENNEDY and I began these 
talks several months ago. He is committed 
to developing a bill on a priority 
basis. Our staffs literally have 
been working night and day. 

Our work has been aided immeasurably 
by the leadership of Chairman 
WAXMAN, and in the Senate, Senator 
CHUCK SCHUMER and Senator CLINTON, 
who have introduced the companion to 
the Waxman bill. Their legislation, the 
Access to Life-Saving Medicine Act, 

H.R. 1038/S. 623, provides a solid starting 
point for discussions. It is an important 
work that has added immeasurably 
to the congressional dialogue. 
It is my hope that our discussions 
will also be informed by the work of 
Representatives JAY INSLEE, GENE 
GREEN and TAMMY BALDWIN, who recently 
introduced the Patient Protection 
and Innovative Biologic Medicines 
Act of 2007, H.R. 1956, and by the views 
of the many, many stakeholders in this 
legislative effort. 

The time to develop a pathway for 
approval of biosimilar products is long 
past overdue. It should be our priority, 
and it should be our high priority, to 
get it done this year. But, we should 
get it done right. Our deliberations 
must be based on science. The original 
balance of the law must be maintained, 
but we must also recognize the emerging 
realities of this new world. 

And what are those realities? First, 
biotechnology products are not drugs; 
they are very complicated molecules 
that are not easily reproduced. An inadvertent 
change in the structure of 
that molecule can lead to very devastating 
consequences. 

Second, today, it is unlikely that any 
follow-on company will be able to 
produce an exact copy of a biotech 
molecule, a generic biologic if you will, 
at least at first. 

Third, because science advances, and 
because American researchers are very 

good at advancing science—stem cell 
research is one example that comes 
readily to mind—we must hold open 
the possibility that one day there will 
be true biogenerics. 

And we must also develop a pathway 
so that biosimilar products can be approved 
without a full biologics license 
application, a time-consuming and expensive 
process. 

But whatever policy we develop, it 
must be based on soundness of science, 
rather than the practicalities of politics. 


Fourth, we must take into account 
the unique nature of today’s industry. 
This is so much more than an exercise 
between big Pharma and the generics, 
or even between big bio and the 
generics. 

Indeed, there are about 1,400 biotech 
companies in the United States. How 
many of them are profitable? Astoundingly, 
only 20. 

Many of these companies are small, 
with revenues of under a million dollars 
per year. Many do not even have a 
product on the market. 

We must examine closely the issue of 
who will be making biosimilars? Will it 
be the Barr Labs and Tevas of the 
world? Undoubtedly. 

But it may also be generic subsidiaries 
of innovator companies. 

It is also very likely to be companies 
in India and China. As we have seen 
with the recent concerns over pet food, 
inspecting foreign manufacturing 
plants has historically been a problem 
for the resource-constrained Food and 
Drug Administration. 

Fifth, we must use the framework of 
Hatch-Waxman where we can, but we 
must recognize there may be ways to 
improve it. 

There are obvious differences between 
regulating a pathway for 
biosimilars and for copies of chemical 
drugs. For example, as I mentioned, today’s 
science will probably not allow 
identical copies of today’s biologics. 
So, the concept of bioequivalence cannot 
be imported into this debate. Instead, 
we must work carefully to define 
biosimilarity. 

Another difference today is the fact 
that process patents are much more integrally 
tied to the manufacture of biologics. 
Current law does not require 
listing of process patents in the orange 
book. 

Waxman-Hatch is inherently a litigious 
process. But its framework—the 
patent holder or drug manufacturer—v. 
the generic—does not easily translate 
to a system in which multiple patent 
holders may exist, including, for example, 
major universities and research 
centers. 

Sixth, the incentives for development 
of biotech products must be maintained, 
enhanced where it advances 
public policy. But at the same time, we 
cannot seed a new generation of roadblocks 
that preclude biosimilar entry. 
This is the nub of the key, crucial balance. 


Seventh, the role of the FDA must be 
carefully evaluated. We must empower 

the agency to evaluate pure, safe and 
potent copies of biotech products, but 
we must all recognize that there must 
be a bright line that separates a safe 
copy from a new product which should 
be subject to a full biologic license application. 


We need to free the agency and provide 
it with the flexibility to evaluate 
the adequacy of a biosimilar submission 
based on good science, but we 
must also recognize that, as Commissioner 
von Eschenbach has said, there 
may be some products which cannot be 
copied safely with today’s science. 

Eighth, we must make certain the resources 
are there for the FDA to do the 
job right. I must note that negotiations 
between the agency and the pharmaceutical 
industry on the Prescription 
Drug User Fee Act reauthorization, 
or PDUFA, took over one year. 
Every indication I have is that review 
of a biosimilar application is very likely 
to be more complex and time consuming 
than that for a new biologics license 
application. 

There must be authority for a fee to 
be collected that reflects this complex 
workload. If we do not provide adequate 
resources to the FDA, then review 
of new products could suffer at 
the expense of cheaper copies as reviewers 
become siphoned off from new 
products to the biosimilars. We should 
not design a system in which this occurs. 


And I must digress at this point to 
underscore that the FDA is already 
cash-strapped and that situation simply 
must be corrected. The dire FDA 
resources issue appears to have manifested 
iself in such recent revelations 
as to the inadequacy of food inspections 
for some of the most ubiquitous 
products in American life, including 
pet food and peanut butter. 

Federal policymakers must take this 
into account when legislating, and the 
Food and Drug Administration Revitalization 
Act is a good place to start. 

Enacting follow-on biologics legislation 
is a top priority for me. I want us 
to finalize a bill on a priority basis, 
and it is my hope it can be included in 
the final version of FDARA that 
emerges from the conference committee. 


Before I close, I want to talk about 
one other issue that is often debated 
when FDA-related legislation is considered 
on the floor: importation of prescription 
drugs. This morning, I listened 
to our colleague, the Senator 
from North Dakota, Mr. DORGAN, talk 
about his legislation which allows prescription 
drugs from other countries to 
be imported into the United States 
from other countries. My colleague refers 
to this as drug reimportation 
which I believe gives people the false 
impression that these drugs are originally 
manufactured in the United 
States, exported to another country 
and then imported back to the United 
States. I just want to clarify that is 
not typically the case. 

In addition, I saw the Senator from 
North Dakota hold up two bottles of 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5379 

Lipitor and say that there is no difference 
between a drug manufactured 
in Ireland and a drug manufactured in 
the United States. He suggested that 
the pills may be different colors but 
the bottles are the same and the medicine 
in the bottle is the same. 

That may be true for the two bottles 
of drugs that he had on the Senate 
floor. But how could we be assured that 
is always the case? Can we always 
guarantee that pills in a bottle labeled 
from Ireland are actually manufactured 
in Ireland? I don’t think so. 

This issue is the crux of the problem—
unless the FDA has approved 
these medications, we have no way of 
knowing what is actually in the bottle. 
In fact, when I served as chairman of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee, I 
held a hearing on drug importation and 
this issue was raised by one of the 
members of the committee. At that 
July 14, 2004, hearing, one Senator specifically 
asked about a prescription 
drug bottle labeled as being from Canada. 
William Hubbard, the Associate 
Commissioner for Policy and Planning 
for the FDA, told her that even though 
the label said the bottle was from Canada, 
the FDA had no idea where that 
bottle had originated. 

In fact, at that hearing, Mr. Hubbard 
said: 

Although some purchasers of drugs from 
foreign sources may receive genuine product, 
others may unknowingly buy counterfeit 
copies that contain only inert ingredients, 
legitimate drugs that are outdated and have 
been diverted to unscrupulous resellers, or 
dangerous sub-potent or super-potent products 
that were improperly manufactured. 
Furthermore, in the case of foreign-based 
sources, if a consumer has an adverse drug 
reaction or any other problem, the consumer 
may have little or no recourse either because 
the operator of the pharmacy often is not 
known, or the physical location of the seller 
is unknown or beyond the consumer’s reach. 
FDA has only limited ability to take action 
against these foreign operators. 

On a related issue, I would like to 
share Mr. Hubbard’s insights on the 
safety of drugs that have been imported 
from other countries. 

FDA remains concerned about the public 
health implications of unapproved prescription 
drugs from entities seeking to profit by 
getting around U.S. legal standards for drug 
safety and effectiveness. Many drugs obtained 
from foreign sources that either purport 
to be or appear to be the same as U.S.-
approved prescription drugs are, in fact, of 
unknown quality. Consumers are exposed to 
a number of potential risks when they purchase 
drugs from foreign sources or from 
sources that are not operated by pharmacies 
properly licensed under state pharmacy laws. 
These outlets may dispense expired, sub-
potent, contaminated or counterfeit product, 
the wrong or a contraindicated product, an 
incorrect dose, or medication unaccompanied 
by adequate directions for use. The 
labeling of the drug may not be in English 
and therefore important information regarding 
dosage, warnings and side effects may 
not be available to the consumer. The drugs 
may not have been packaged and stored 
under appropriate conditions to prevent degradation, 
and there is no assurance that 
these products were manufactured under current 
good manufacturing practice (cGMP) 

standards. When consumers take such medications, 
they face risks of dangerous drug 
interactions and/or of suffering adverse 
events, some of which can be life-threatening. 
More commonly, if the drugs are sub-
potent or ineffective, they may suffer complications 
from the illnesses that their prescriptions 
were intended to treat, without 
ever knowing the true cause. 

Mr. President, this was a sobering 
hearing and I urge my colleagues, especially 
those who support the importation 
of prescription drugs into this 
country, to take the time to review the 
testimony from the July 14, 2004, hearing. 
We had many witnesses who provided 
valuable insights on this issue. 

To address Senator DORGAN’s other 
point regarding the cost of prescription 
drugs, I want to make one thing perfectly 
clear—I want Americans to have 
access to affordable drugs, but I also 
want these drugs to be safe and effective. 
As one of the authors of Hatch-
Waxman, I understand the problem of 
pharmaceutical costs, and I have a 
record of working to find solutions. 
But bringing potentially unsafe medicines, 
medicines uncertified by the 
FDA, into the United States is not a 
solution. 

In conclusion, I ask my colleagues 
who are skeptical about this bill to reserve 
judgment and listen carefully to 
the debate. While I supported this bill 
when it was considered by the Senate 
HELP Committee 2 weeks ago, I honestly 
believe that members of the 
HELP Committee have worked hard together 
to make the reported bill even 
better. So I urge my colleagues to take 
the time to review the bill because 
there are a lot of good provisions in it. 

I would like to take this opportunity 
to recognize the hard work of the staffs 
of both our committee chairman, Senator 
KENNEDY, and our ranking minority 
member, Senator ENZI. I would specifically 
like to thank Amy Muhlberg 
and David Dorsey for their dedication 
and hard work on this issue—they have 
been working on drug safety legislation 
for over 2 years and I want both of 
them to know how much all of us appreciate 
their efforts. I also want to 
recognize Shana Christrup and David 
Bowen for their leadership in helping 
their bosses get this bill to the floor 
under very difficult time constraints. 
All of the HELP Committee members’ 
staff have worked long hours and many 
weekend hours and I just want you to 
know how much I appreciate all of you. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The Senator from West Virginia 
is recognized. 

IRAQ 

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 4 years 
ago, I stood in this very spot and 
warned against an ill-advised invasion 
of Iraq. Today, the situation in Iraq 
has spiraled out of control, into a 
bloody, deadly, sectarian civil war. Yet 
the President and his team continue to 
hold fast to their ‘‘stay the course’’ 
nonsense. While they do, thousands of 
brave young Americans place their 
lives in jeopardy every day. That re


ality is one this Nation and the world 
did not have to experience. It is a tragic 
reality, brought on by a war of 
choice and an occupation that has 
yielded neither stability nor reconciliation. 


Four years ago today, the President 
landed on the deck of the USS Abraham 
Lincoln to declare, ‘‘Mission accomplished.’’ 
Four years ago—it feels like 
an age. For thousands of our soldiers 
and their families, and likely for the 
Iraqi people, it feels like a lifetime. 
How wrong our President was then, and 
how wrong our President continues to 
be today. 

Ralph Waldo Emerson said: 

A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of 
little minds, adored by little statesmen and 
philosophers and divines. 

No matter how many times the 
President wishes it were so, peace in 
Iraq will not be found at the barrel of 
an American gun. No matter how hard 
the President hopes that it will happen, 
sectarian violence will not be 
quelled with U.S. forces occupying the 
Iraqi nation. Cross your fingers, pull 
out your lucky rabbit’s foot, even nail 
a horseshoe over the Oval Office door, 
but hoping for luck will never change 
the deadly dynamic in Iraq. 

Peace demands an Iraqi-led political 
solution to transcend the ethnic and 
sectarian divisions that are splitting 
the country apart—a political effort 
which, to date, the Iraqi Government 
has been unable or unwilling to take 
on. Our legislation could have spurred 
that progress, but President Bush has 
defiantly said no. This White House 
clings to its ‘‘foolish consistency.’’ 

When he took office as President 
more than 6 years ago, George W. Bush 
issued a call for renewed responsibility 
in government. Where are the echoes of 
that call today? What is responsible 
about clinging to this failed course in 
Iraq and refusing to consider a new 
path? What is responsible about the 
President continuing to foster and manipulate 
the fears of the American people? 


Faced with the tragic consequences 
of its misjudgments in Iraq, the Bush 
administration is paralyzed, unwilling 
to acknowledge, much less remedy, its 
catastrophic blunders. President Bush 
has gone so far as to say that the way 
out of Iraq will be decided by future 
Presidents. 

What an outrageous abdication of responsibility. 
It is unacceptable to pass 
this buck to future leaders while our 
brave troops fight and die today in the 
crosshairs of this Iraqi civil war. The 
time to begin rectifying this dreadful 
blunder is now, not in 2 years, not with 
the next President but now. 

With the supplemental bill, Congress 
responded to the call of the American 
people. We offered a new beginning in 
reconstruction and stability for Iraq. 
Our proposal could have generated political 
reconciliation and economic security 
in Iraq. Our bipartisan plan 
shifted the responsibility for the Iraqi 
nation’s long-term success to the Iraqi 


S5380 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

people themselves. But plainly Congress 
offered a plan that could have 
meant a brighter future for Iraq, a future 
controlled by the Iraqi people 
themselves with continued support 
from the United States. But the President 
has flatly rejected that plan. It is 
a sad day for our Nation and for the 
world. 

Before the war began, I urged the 
President to think through the consequences. 
There was no doubt as to 
the military outcome of the war between 
the United States and Iraq. Our 
military might was certainly unquestioned. 
I was very concerned about the 
repercussions that would follow this 
certain military victory. Tragically, 
the repercussions I feared all have 
come to pass. Oh, how I wish, yes, how 
I wish that I had been wrong. 

Once again, I urge the President to 
think through the consequences of his 
choices, the consequences of his rejection 
of this new plan for Iraq, the consequences 
of clinging to false hopes, for 
that is what this veto does. This veto 
endorses the falsehoods that took us to 
war. It cements failed policy in place. 
This veto ensures that hundreds, 
maybe thousands, more will die in Iraq 
without any true plan for peace. It 
forces our military to continue to pursue 
a mission impossible, creating democracy 
at the point of a gun. 

I am sorry this day has come to pass. 
I am so sorry the horrors of this deadly 
and mishandled occupation have become 
the stuff of political gamesmanship. 
There is ample blame to go 
around for that fact. 

I have seen clashes between the legislative 
and executive branches. I have 
seen Presidents make mistakes in the 
past. Everyone, yes everyone, makes 
mistakes. I certainly have made mistakes, 
but I have never seen such arrogance 
in a White House that seals its 
eyes and ears and blindly sends so 
many people to their doom. I pray for 
our troops, for our President—yes, I 
do—and I pray for our country, yes, for 
our country, and for the people of Iraq. 

President Bush has chosen to hold 
hostage $100 billion for our troops to 
his, President Bush’s, policies, his 
failed policies. But his choice, his 
choice, is not the last word. Congress 
will get to work on a new version of 
the supplemental appropriations conference 
report. We, with the Lord’s 
will, will not delay, but we also will 
not stop our efforts to stand for what is 
right and to craft policies that reflect 
the true strength of America: humility, 
modesty, honesty. 

We will continue to press for a 
strong, intelligent foreign policy that 
does not rely on military might alone. 
And we will not stop in our efforts to 
bring peace to Iraq and our troops 
home from war, so help me God. 

I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Landrieu 
amendment be set aside and that I may 
be able to offer an amendment. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

AMENDMENT NO. 990 

Mr. DORGAN. I have amendment No. 
990 at the desk. I ask for its consideration. 


The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will report. 

The assistant legislative clerk read 
as follows: 

The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. DORGAN], 
for himself, Ms. SNOWE, Mr. GRASSLEY, 
Mr. MCCAIN, Ms. STABENOW, Mr. NELSON of 
Florida, Mr. PRYOR, Mr. SANDERS, Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE, and Mrs. MCCASKILL, proposes 
an amendment number 990. 

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the reading of 
the amendment be dispensed with. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 

Mr. DORGAN. I offer this amendment 
on behalf of myself and Senator SNOWE 
and other cosponsors, including Senator 
STABENOW, Senator GRASSLEY, 
Senator MCCAIN, Senator PRYOR, Senator 
SANDERS, Senator WHITEHOUSE, 
and Senator MCCASKILL. 

This amendment comes from a piece 
of legislation we have previously introduced 
dealing with the reimportation 
of prescription drugs, FDA-approved, 
lower priced prescription drugs that 
are sold in other parts of the world for 
much lower prices than they are priced 
in the United States. There are 33 cosponsors 
on the bill as it was introduced 
in the Senate. It seems clear to 
me that the best approach to advancing 
this legislation is to offer it as an 
amendment to the legislation that reauthorizes 
the Food and Drug Administration. 
Inasmuch as this subject deals 
with the FDA, it would provide funding 
for the FDA, guidelines for the FDA on 
reimportation of drugs. I am not going 
to speak at length today. I spoke earlier 
today. I intend to come back tomorrow 
morning to speak at some 
greater length. 

I know my colleagues, Senator 
SNOWE and Senator GRASSLEY and Senator 
STABENOW and Senator SANDERS— 
I have talked to him—I know others 
will wish to come and speak as well. 
But suffice it to say, we have a situation 
in this country today in which the 

U.S. consumer is charged the highest 
prices in the world for prescription 
drugs. That is just a fact. Today I held 
up two pill bottles on the floor of the 
Senate, identical bottles that contained 
the same prescription drug medicine 
made in Ireland. It was called 
Lipitor, for controlling cholesterol. 
The tablets were made in a manufacturing 
plant, FDA-approved plant in 
Ireland. The two bottles I held up 
today were different only in that one 
was sent to Canada and one was sent to 
the United States. 

The one sent to the United States 
was priced nearly double the price of 
the medicine sent to Canada. But that 
is not unusual. The same thing would 
be true with respect to medicine that 
was sold in Germany or Italy or France 
or Spain or England. They all pay 
much lower prices for the same prescription 
drug, the identical drug made 
in the identical plant—FDA-approved, 
sold all around the world, except the 

U.S. consumer is given the privilege of 
paying the highest prices in the world, 
in some cases 80 or 90 percent higher, 
in some cases 120 percent higher than 
others pay for the identical prescription 
drug. 
Our point with this amendment simply 
is that if the global economy is 
going to work, why doesn’t it work for 
everybody? How about the little guy 
who is buying prescription drugs and is 
paying the highest prices in the world. 

We have put together a piece of legislation 
with very significant safety precautions 
so that there are no safety 
issues at all. I mentioned today that 
Europe does this routinely. They have 
a parallel trading system in Europe. 
They have had it for a couple of decades. 
If you are in Germany and want 
to buy a prescription drug from 
France, no problem. If you are in Italy 
and want to buy it from Germany, no 
problem. 

They have a parallel trading system 
that allows the consumers to access 
the best prices. It is only the American 
consumer that is disadvantaged by a 
sweetheart deal that allows the prescription 
drug industry to engage their 
own price controls, which means that 
we pay the highest prices in the world. 

We have offered an amendment. We 
have 33 cosponsors on the underlying 
legislation. The amendment I offer on 
behalf of myself and Senator SNOWE, 
bipartisan legislation, as I indicated— 

Senators GRASSLEY and MCCAIN, 
STABENOW, PRYOR, SANDERS, 
WHITEHOUSE, MCCASKILL. 

This is a good amendment. It is good 
public policy. I know the prescription 
drug industry, the pharmaceutical industry 
doesn’t like it. I understand 
that. I do not come here with a grievance 
against that industry. I just do 
not like their pricing policy. I do not 
like the fact that they say to the 
American people: You pay the highest 
prices in the world. 

That is not fair. It ought to change. 
Our amendment is aiming to change it. 

Mr. President, I will speak at greater 
length on the subject tomorrow. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen


ator from Utah is recognized. 

Mr. HATCH. As usual, my dear friend 
from North Dakota is articulate, and 
he deserves to be listened to, but I disagree 
with him. 

The Dorgan amendment allows individuals 
to import a qualifying drug, 
and this will pose an overwhelming set 
of resource burdens for the FDA, Customs, 
and other agencies, especially 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5381 

the FDA. It would, as I have mentioned 
before, create very significant safety 
concerns. 

This amendment establishes a complicated 
system for the regulation of 
imported drugs. Now this system that 
he suggests is so vast, it would take 
and require a lot of money, more than 
all of the proposed fees could support. 

Where would an already strapped 
Federal agency such as FDA get these 
additional dollars? So far we have not 
given it to them. There have been estimates 
that these dollars would amount 
to so much that there is no way that 
we could give them enough money. 

This amendment allows foreign-imported 
products to be approved for distribution 
in the United States even 
when they may not be bioequivalent to 
the FDA-approved products. Now the 
reason I cite that is because the letter 
from the FDA, this letter was sent to 
the Honorable BYRON L. DORGAN, Senator 
DORGAN. This letter was sent April 
10, 2007. 

I ask unanimous consent that this 
letter be printed at the conclusion of 
my remarks. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 

objection, it is so ordered. 

(See exhibit 1.) 

Mr. HATCH. In that letter, just to 
mention a couple of things, the Acting 
Deputy Commissioner for Policy, Randall 
W. Lutter, Ph.D.—let me just mention 
a couple of sentences. 

He said: 

Nevertheless, the Agency continues to 
have concerns with enacting such a sweeping 
importation program and fears that intermediaries 
would likely swallow the bulk of 
cost-savings, preventing the American consumers 
from enjoying much, if any, practical 

benefit from such a program. 

On safety concerns, he said: 

We have safety concerns related to both 
the identification of unsafe or non-complaint 
drug products and about the substitutability 
for domestic products. 

On identifying unsafe/noncompliant 
drug products, he said: 

The section of the bill that would allow individuals 
to import a qualifying drug from a 
registered exporter would likely pose an 
overwhelming resource burden for the Agency 
and create significant safety concerns. 

Just reading at random: 

S.242 would establish a complicated system 
for the regulation of imported drugs. This 
complex system is so vast that it would be 
enormously resource-intensive, likely much 
greater than the proposed registration fees 
and inspection fees could support. 
On a lack of substitutability, he said: 

The proposed bill provides a mechanism for 
foreign imported products to be approved for 
distribution in the U.S. even though these 
products may not be bioequivalent to the 
FDA-approved product. 

This letter is a serious letter. I don’t 
think we should ignore letters such as 
these in our zeal to resolve problems. I 
believe the distinguished Senator from 
North Dakota is very well intentioned. 
I have a tremendous regard for him and 
for his ability to explain things on the 
floor of the Senate. 

I also ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD excerpts of the 

testimony before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee on July 14, 2004, entitled 
‘‘Examining the Implications of Drug 
Importation,’’ of Mr. William Hubbard, 
Associate Commissioner for Policy and 
Planning of the U.S. FDA. 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 

TESTIMONY: UNITED STATES SENATE 

COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY 

EXAMINING THE IMPLICATIONS OF DRUG 
IMPORTATION, JULY 14, 2004 
Mr. William Hubbard, Associate Commis


sioner for Policy and Planning, U.S. Food 

and Drug Administration 

INTRODUCTION 
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, 
I am Mr. William K. Hubbard, 
Associate Commissioner for Policy and Planning 
at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA or the Agency). With me is John 

M. Taylor, Associate Commissioner for Regulatory 
Affairs at FDA. We appreciate having 
this opportunity to discuss with you the 
issues relating to the importation of prescription 
drugs into the United States and 
the use of the Internet to facilitate the sale 
of these drugs. 
At FDA, our statutory responsibility is to 
assure the American public that the drug 
supply is safe, secure, and reliable. For more 
than 60 years, the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic (FD&C) Act has ensured that 
Americans can be confident that, when they 
use an FDA-approved drug, the medicine will 
be safe and effective and will work as intended 
in treating their illness and preventing 
complications. In carrying out this 
responsibility, FDA is working to do all we 
can under the law to make medicines accessible 
and help doctors and patients to use 
them as effectively as possible, through such 
steps as expanding access to generic medicines, 
reducing the time and cost of showing 
that new medicines are safe and effective, 
and providing up-to-date information for 
health professionals and patients to obtain 
the benefits and avoid the risks associated 
with powerful medicines. That is the primary 
mission of the thousands of dedicated 
staff, including leading health care experts, 
doctors, economists and scientists who work 
tirelessly at FDA in public service for the 
American people. FDA remains strongly concerned 
about counterfeit, and/or illegally imported 
pharmaceuticals whose safety (and effectiveness 
cannot be assured because they 
are distributed outside the legal structure 
and regulatory resources provided by Congress. 


IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
Sixty-five years ago, Congress responded to 
widespread instances of unsafe drugs by directing 
FDA to implement a system for assuring 
that Americans have a drug supply 
they can trust will not harm them. Over 
forty years ago, Congress required that legal 
drugs be proven to be effective as well, because 
modern medicines—when they are produced, 
distributed, prescribed, and used properly—
should not only be safe but effective in 
the treatment of disease. More recently, in 
1988, Congress enacted the Prescription Drug 
Marketing Act (PDMA) to establish additional 
safeguards to prevent substandard, ineffective, 
or counterfeit drugs from entering 
the U.S. Under PDMA, it is illegal for anyone 
other than the drug’s original manufacturer 
to re-import a prescription drug into 
the U.S. that was manufactured in the U.S. 
This law was enacted with strong bipartisan 
support because of high-profile cases of unsafe 
and ineffective drugs entering the U.S. 
in large volumes. In one instance, over 2 mil


lion unapproved and potentially unsafe and 
ineffective Ovulen–2l ‘‘birth control’’ tablets 
from Panama were distributed into the U.S. 
as ‘‘American goods returned.’’ In another 
case, a counterfeit version of Ceclor, a widely 
used antibiotic at the time, found its way 
into the U.S. drug distribution from a foreign 
source. Over the years, FDA has employed 
PDMA and other authorities to build 
a drug safety infrastructure to ensure that 
Americans enjoy the highest-quality drug 
supply in the world. 

Unfortunately, the drug supply is under 
unprecedented attack from a variety of increasingly 
sophisticated threats. This is evident 
in the recent significant increase in efforts 
to introduce counterfeit drugs into the 

U.S. market. FDA has seen its number of 
counterfeit drug investigations increase 
four-fold since the late 1990s. Although counterfeiting 
was once a rare event, we are increasingly 
seeing large supplies of counterfeit 
versions of finished drugs being manufactured 
and distributed by well-funded and 
elaborately organized networks. At the same 
time, inadequately regulated foreign Internet 
sites have also become portals for unsafe 
and illegal drugs. For example, FDA recently 
worked with domestic and international authorities 
to shut down a website that was advertising 
‘‘FDA-approved’’ and safe ‘‘European’’ 
birth control pills and other drugs, 
but was actually responsible for importing 
ineffective, counterfeit drugs. Evidence 
strongly suggests that the volume of these 
foreign drug importations is increasing 
steadily, presenting an increasingly difficult 
challenge for Agency field personnel at 
ports-of-entry, mail facilities, and international 
courier hubs, and our laboratory 
analysts and border and law enforcement 
partners. 
FDA is doing its best to use its limited resources 
and international authorities to stop 
the increasing flow of violative drugs into 
this country, but the task is daunting. FDA’s 
Office of Regulatory Affairs has inspectors 
working in the field who perform investigations 
pertaining to imported prescription 
drugs, a job that is not limited to inspections 
at ports-of-entry. Each day, however, 
thousands of individual packages containing 
prescription drugs are imported illegally 
into the U.S., simply because the sheer volume 
has grown to exceed the capability of 
FDA field personnel to properly process. 

SAFETY CONCERNS RELATING TO IMPORTATION 
FDA remains concerned about the public 
health implications of unapproved prescription 
drugs from entities seeking to profit by 
getting around U.S. legal standards for drug 
safety and effectiveness. Many drugs obtained 
from foreign sources that either purport 
to be or appear to be the same as U.S.-
approved prescription drugs are, in fact, of 
unknown quality. Consumers are exposed to 
a number of potential risks when they purchase 
drugs from foreign sources or from 
sources that are not operated by pharmacies 
properly licensed under state pharmacy laws. 
These outlets may dispense expired, sub-
potent, contaminated or counterfeit product, 
the wrong or a contraindicated product, an 
incorrect dose, or medication unaccompanied 
by adequate directions for use. The 
labeling of the drug may not be in English 
and therefore important information regarding 
dosage, warnings and side effects may 
not be available to the consumer. The drugs 
may not have been packaged and stored 
under appropriate conditions to prevent degradation, 
and there is no assurance that 
these products were manufactured under current 
good manufacturing practice (cGMP) 
standards. When consumers take such medications, 
they face risks of dangerous drug 
interactions and/or of suffering adverse 


S5382 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

events, some of which can be life-threatening. 
More commonly, if the drugs are sub-
potent or ineffective, they may suffer complications 
from the illnesses that their prescriptions 
were intended to treat, without 
ever knowing the true cause. 

Patients also are at greater risk because 
there is no certainty about what they are 
getting when they purchase some of these 
drugs. Although some purchasers of drugs 
from foreign sources may receive genuine 
product, others may unknowingly buy counterfeit 
copies that contain only inert ingredients, 
legitimate drugs that are outdated 
and have been diverted to unscrupulous resellers, 
or dangerous subpotent or super-potent 
products that were improperly manufactured. 
Furthermore, in the case of foreign-
based sources, if a consumer has an adverse 
drug reaction or any other problem, the consumer 
may have little or no recourse either 
because the operator of the pharmacy often 
is not known, or the physical location of the 
seller is unknown or beyond the consumer’s 
reach. FDA has only limited ability to take 
action against these foreign operators. 

The Agency has responded to the challenge 
of importation by employing a risk-based enforcement 
strategy to target our existing enforcement 
resources effectively in the face of 
multiple priorities, including homeland security, 
food safety and counterfeit drugs. However, 
this system, as it works today, is already 
overwhelmed by the number of incoming 
packages, and this presents a significant 
ongoing challenge for the Agency. 

Recent spot examinations of mail shipments 
of foreign drugs to U.S. consumers revealed 
that these shipments often contain 
dangerous or unapproved drugs that pose potentially 
serious safety problems. In 2003, inspectors 
found that the majority of the packages 
examined in these ‘‘blitzes’’ contained 
illegal drugs. Last summer, FDA and the 

U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency 
(CBP) conducted blitz examinations on mail 
shipments at the Miami and New York (JFK 
Airport) mail facilities in July, and the San 
Francisco and Carson, California, mail facilities 
in August. In each location, the agencies 
examined packages shipped by international 
mail over a 3–day time span. Of the 1,153 
shipments examined, the overwhelming majority 
(1,019 packages, or 88 percent) contained 
unapproved drugs. The drugs arrived 
from many countries. For example, 16 percent 
entered the U.S. from Canada; 14 percent 
were from India 14 percent came from 
Thailand, and 8 percent were shipped from 
the Philippines. 
Mr. HATCH. These are serious statements 
by serious people. I don’t think 
we should ignore them. It is one thing 
to argue that you don’t like the pharmaceutical 
companies, and many don’t. 
It is another thing to argue that these 
drugs that are going to be imported or 
reimported are absolute identical copies 
of what they represent. I would pay 
attention to what these people are saying. 


I also ask unanimous consent to 
print in the RECORD the statement of a 
Customs officer who came and testified 
on the 14th. 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 

U.S. SENATOR ORRIN G. HATCH (R–UT) HOLDS 
HEARING ON DRUG IMPORTATION 
Mr. HATCH. Ms. Durant. 
Ms. Durant. Mr. Chairman, members of the 

committee, thank you for this opportunity 
to testify. 
I’m Elizabeth Durant, director of trade 
compliance and facilitation in the Office of 

Field Operations at the Bureau of Customs 
and Border Protection. 

Today I’d like to discuss with you CBP’s 
efforts to address the ever-increasing trend 
of personal and bulk importation of pharmaceutical 
products and controlled substances 
into the United States. 

Although the main focus of the CBP has 
shifted to protecting the United States from 
terrorist attacks, we also enforce over 400 requirements 
for more than 40 other federal 
agencies at U.S. borders. These include the 
laws that prohibit the importation of illegal 
or unapproved pharmaceuticals that fall 
under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug 
Administration, as well as those controlled 
substances that are under the jurisdiction of 
the Drug Enforcement Administration. 

The issue of U.S. consumers buying prescription 
drugs from foreign sources has become 
a significant concern. A growing number 
of Americans obtain their medications 
from foreign locations. However, the safety 
of drugs purchased from these sources cannot 
be insured. Drugs produced outside the 
United States may be counterfeit. Counterfeiting 
can apply to both brand name and generic 
drugs where the identity of the source 
is deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled 
in a way that suggests that it is the authentic 
approved product. 

The CBP is concerned with three avenues 
that pharmaceuticals are imported: Those 
that are purchased through the Internet and 
shipped through our international mail express 
courier facilities; those carried into 
the States by individuals transiting our land 
borders; and bulk shipments of adulterated 
or counterfeit pharmaceuticals. During the 
course of the past year we have taken several 
steps to address each of these areas. 

Millions of packages come through the 
mail and express courier facilities every 
year. Thousands of packages, particularly in 
the mail, are found to contain illegal and approved 
pharmaceuticals. We also estimate 
that 10 million people cross the land border 
annually carrying unapproved products. 

Additionally, we have found bulk pharmaceutical 
shipments that were attempted to 
be imported through the mail potentially indicating 
that these products could be making 
their way to pharmacy shelves. 

In order to address what is clearly a growing 
threat to this public health, CBP has 
been working cooperatively with the DEA, 
the FDA, our own U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement, ONDCP and the Department 
of Justice attorneys in an interagency 
working group directed at addressing issues 
related to the importation of prescription 
drugs and miscellaneous pharmaceuticals. 

The working group has conducted regular 
meetings since January 2004 and has 
achieved several key accomplishments since 
its inception, including conducting a joint 
interagency enforcement operation known as 
Operation Safety Cap, which was designed to 
look at passenger importations of pharmaceuticals 
from Mexico. 

Operation Safety Cap was an interagency 
plan to enforce laws related to the importation 
of prescription drugs at the border. Both 
FDA and ICE participated in the enforcement 
operation. The plan began with a public 
outreach, followed by an enforcement effort 
at the Ports of Andrade, Yuma, Tecate, 
San Luis and Calexico. The purpose was to 
evaluate compliance with laws related to the 
importation of prescription drugs. 

During the course of the operation there 
were several troubling instances of returning 

U.S. residents receiving different medications 
than the ones they thought they were 
being prescribed. 
In one instance there was no active ingredient 
in the unmarked, undeclared bottle 
that was brought into the U.S. The overall 

seizure detention rate was nearly 7 percent 
of the number of individuals inspected, 
which was significant enough to warrant additional 
enforcement efforts at our land borders. 


Based on an operation nicknamed ‘‘Operation 
Safeguard’’ that we have carried out 
over the last couple of years, we have found 
the volume of pharmaceuticals shipped 
through international mail to be enormous. 
We have also found a significant number of 
these products do not contain an active 
pharmaceutical ingredient, but merely contain 
substances such as starch or sugar. 

Other problems include expired materials, 
unapproved products, improper use instructions 
and products made in facilities not 
under proper regulation. The vast majority 
of the pharmaceuticals that enter the United 
States via the mail do so in a manner that 
according to FDA violates present FDA and 
other requirements. 

It is clear that the importation of pharmaceuticals 
and controlled substances remains 
an overwhelming problem for CBP. We are 
working with the FDA, the DEA, ICE and 
other regulatory agencies to develop a more 
practical and workable approach to solve 
this huge problem. 

I want to thank you and the members of 
the committee for considering Customs and 
Border Protection in your review of the importation 
of pharmaceuticals and controlled 
substances. This is an issue that speaks directly 
to our mission. We will continue to 
make every effort possible to work with the 
Congress and our fellow inspection agencies 
to address the health and safety concerns of 
the American people. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I look forward 
to responding to any questions today. 

Mr. HATCH. It was a startling statement. 
I know at least one Democratic 
Senator, who takes matters very seriously 
and who was for importation or 
reimportation of drugs, was shocked at 
some of the testimony because she did 
not believe things could be as bad as 
they represented and was kind of 
shocked that they made a pretty darn 
good case that these matters are much 
more serious than some are taking 
them. 

I don’t have anything more to say at 
this time, but I hope we will think this 
through before we saddle the American 
people with something that can be disastrous 
in their lives. I am familiar 
with how some of these drugs that people 
think are good drugs that come 
into this country are adulterated. 
Some are made with contaminated 
water, do not have any efficacy in 
them at all. Yet they look identical to 
what our U.S. manufacturers are making 
or what other qualified manufacturers 
are doing. We can’t ignore these 
things. I think even if we could give 
FDA all the money—and it would 
amount to trillions of dollars, certainly 
hundreds of billions of dollars 
but I think trillions of dollars—to handle 
this, there is still no way FDA can 
take care of all the problems that 
would come up. 

We have a pretty good system here. I 
have to admit, I wish we could get drug 
prices down. As the author of the 
Hatch-Waxman Act, we worked hard to 
get the generic business into action. At 
the time we did Hatch-Waxman, 
generics were no more than 17 or 18 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5383 

percent of the total marketplace. 
Today they are over 50 percent. Hatch-
Waxman is the reason they are there. 
In every case, every year we have saved 
at least $10 billion for the consumers. 
What many in this body seem to ignore 
is that it costs these innovator companies 
upwards of $1 billion to create one 
of these drugs. Most of them go 
through at least 6,000 failed experiments 
before they arrive at one of 
these drugs. We can’t ignore that fact. 
The only way they can recoup that 
money is within the few years that are 
left of their patent life. 

This is the only industry I know of— 
there may be others, but I can’t think 
of any—where if you create a widget, 
you have 20 years of patent life, market 
exclusivity. In this industry, a lot 
of that is eaten up by the FDA process. 
It means that the innovator companies 
have very few years in which to recoup 
that billion dollars, upwards of a billion 
dollars. A few years ago, it was 
$800 million, which was astounding to 
me. Now it is approaching a billion; in 
some cases, maybe even more. 

It is one thing to throttle the pharmaceutical 
companies in the interest 
of politics. It is another thing to ignore 
reality and ignore what happens here. 

One reason for Hatch-Waxman was 
because one side wanted all drug price 
competition. They wanted 100 percent 
generics if they could get them. The 
problem is, there would not be any 
generics if you don’t have the innovator 
companies doing the innovative 
drugs. 

Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield 
for a question? 

Mr. HATCH. Sure. 

Mr. DORGAN. My friend from Utah 
did not mean to suggest those of us 
who are offering this amendment on a 
bipartisan basis are doing so for the 
purpose of politics, as he said. My expectation 
is, he would think this would 
be a serious and thoughtful amendment 
that he disagrees strongly with, but I 
hope he would not suggest the motive 
is politics. CBO has suggested this bill 
will save $50 billion for the American 
consumer, $5 billion of which is for the 
Federal Government. This is a serious 
issue and a thoughtful issue. One might 
disagree, but I hope that one would not 
ascribe motives of politics to those of 
us on a bipartisan basis who are offering 
this amendment. 

Mr. HATCH. I have heard some who I 
believe are using it politically in the 
Congress. But I would never ascribe 
that type of attitude to the distinguished 
Senator from North Dakota. I 
believe he is very sincere. I believe he 
is truly trying to represent the consumers 
in the best possible way. I just 
believe he is ignoring some of these 
comments and statements made under 
oath before committees of the Senate 
that fly in the face of what is being 
said here. I would like to see drug 
prices reduced. There is no question 
about it. I worked hard to get them reduced. 
That is what Hatch-Waxman is 
all about. But there are two sides to 

that. One was drug price competition, 
to make sure we could get drugs in generic 
form immediately, once they 
come off patent, which we did. The 
other, of course, is the patent term restoration 
so that we could give innovator 
companies some restoration of 
patent life or market exclusivity so 
they could recoup the moneys, the extraordinary 
costs that are involved. 

When I say I have heard some in the 
Congress who I think have exploited 
this for political purposes, I would 
never say that about my friend from 
North Dakota. I don’t particularly 
want to disparage anybody else, but I 
can say this: There have been some 
who have used this issue politically, 
and there is no doubt about it. I believe 
the Senator from North Dakota is articulate 
and means what he says and is 
doing so for the right reasons. Having 
said that, I don’t think we should ignore 
the testimony of these top people 
in the administration who say this 
could be a disaster for the American 
consuming public. I don’t think you 
can ignore those comments. I am suggesting 
that I hope people will read 
these comments, and I will put more 
into the record before we are through 
with this debate. We are all interested 
in getting drug prices down. There is 
no question about it. I don’t think 
there is anybody in this Congress who 
has done more to bring drug prices 
down than I have, through Hatch-Waxman 
and my friend HENRY WAXMAN 
over in the House and others who supported 
that bill. There is no question 
about it. I am as interested as anybody 
in making sure the consumer public is 
not ripped off. 

On the other hand, these innovative 
drugs cost a lot of money to develop. 
When we get into follow-on biologics, it 
apparently costs even more for these 
large-molecule drugs that may not be 
readily duplicated. In fact, under current 
science, they are not readily duplicated. 
I am very concerned about 
this whole issue. I am very concerned 
about making sure that the record 
shows that we have brought out how 
serious this issue is and how serious 
the consequences are if people are 
wrong, if they happen to get this type 
of legislation through. 

Let me add one other thing. I would 
suggest to my friend from North Dakota 
that the President has already 
said that if this language is in this bill, 
he is going to veto it. I believe that 
veto would be sustained. I think it 
should be sustained. It is one thing to 
come out and argue for something such 
as this, but I would hope that he will 
withdraw his amendment because I 
would hate to see a bill as important to 
our country as this drug safety bill, a 
bill that has brought together Democrats 
and Republicans from the left to 
the right, a bill that would help to save 
as many lives as this bill will do, a bill 
that will help bring to the forefront the 
FDA in a way that it should be 
brought, a bill that has the MDUFA 
and PDUFA moneys in, a bill that has 

children’s programs in, I would hate to 
see this bill vetoed, but I would not 
blame the President one bit if he vetoes 
it based upon the testimony of scientists 
who have testified before our 
committees. 

Frankly, I would think he would be 
right if he vetoed it. But be that as it 
may, I am only one Senator, and I 
think most people know I am very sincere 
in this area. I work very hard in 
these areas. I have a record of accomplishment 
in these areas. I just want to 
make sure that our consuming public 
has every protection they possibly can. 
Unfortunately, it costs a lot of money 
to give them that protection. I wish 
there was some way we could bring 
those prices down. 

Having said that, back in the early 
1990s, I helped put through this body 
the FDA Revitalization Act. Among 
the purposes of that act was to create 
a unitary campus for FDA rather than 
have over 30 different locations in the 
greater metropolitan area around the 
District of Columbia, to have a central 
campus, state-of-the-art equipment, 
the highest technology we can, with an 
incentive to bring the very best scientific 
minds we can into FDA. We all 
know the White Oak complex is being 
built now. It didn’t start until about 5 
or 6 years ago. It is going to take another 
10 years and probably cost a lot 
more than it would have had we done 
what that bill said we could do immediately. 
It was only an authorizing bill. 
The appropriators did not appropriate 
the funds to develop that campus. But 
we have to find a way of helping FDA. 
The sooner we get that campus and 
they have all of the integral online 
services and equipment and top-of-the-
line approaches that they can bring to 
bear, we should be able to bring drug 
prices down through that. But we are a 
long way from the completion of White 
Oak, as we stand here today. 

Frankly, at least we are doing it. At 
least we are going somewhere. I wish to 
attribute some of that to the distinguished 
Senator from Maryland, BARBARA 
MIKULSKI, and others in the 
House who have worked very hard to 
make sure that the FDA revitalization 
approach finally comes to fruition. 

One of the biggest problems we have 
in Government today is to get top scientists 
at FDA. We can’t pay them 
commensurate with scientists at the 
major pharmaceuticals or even the 
major generic companies. In fact, they 
can start at three times or more what 
we pay at FDA. So we have a very difficult 
time continuously getting top 
scientists to come and work at FDA. 
That is a big problem. It is a blessing 
that we do have some of the best scientists 
in the world working there who 
are willing to sacrifice to do what they 
consider to be the important work of 
the Food and Drug Administration. 
This bill will help the Food and Drug 
Administration to do a better job, to 
go forward with more backing from the 
Congress and, in the end, benefit all of 
us who benefit so much from the work 
of the Food and Drug Administration. 


S5384 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

I yield the floor. 
EXHIBIT 1 
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN 
SERVICES, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION 


Rockville, MD, April 10, 2007. 

Hon. BYRON L. DORGAN, 

Chairman, Subcommittee on Interstate Com


merce, Trade and Tourism, Committee on 

Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 

U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR DORGAN: Thank you for the 
opportunity to testify at the March 7, 2007, 
hearing entitled, ‘‘Policy Implications of 
Pharmaceutical Importation for U.S. Consumers,’’ 
before the Senate Subcommittee 
on Interstate Commerce, Trade, and Tourism. 
The Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA or the Agency) is responding to address 
the March 9, 2007, correspondence you sent in 
follow-up to that hearing. 

Your correspondence included statements 
made by former FDA Commissioner, David 
Kessler, at an April 19, 2005, hearing entitled, 
‘‘Examining S. 334, to amend the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect 
to the importation of prescription drugs,’’ 
held by the Senate Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. Dr. 
Kessler’s statements focused on the issues of 
safety, resources, supply chain security, and 
standards for approval of foreign versions of 
FDA-approved drugs. You asked that I explain 
my views on the ‘‘Pharmaceutical Market 
Access and Drug Safety Act’’ in the context 
of these issues. The bulk of this response 
details our views about these issues. 

I would like to start, however, by commending 
you for your efforts to address 
American consumers’ concerns regarding access 
to affordable prescription medications. 
Nevertheless, the Agency continues to have 
concerns with enacting such a sweeping importation 
program and fears that intermediaries 
would likely swallow the bulk of 
cost-savings, preventing American consumers 
from enjoying much, if any, practical 
benefit from such a program. We expect such 
a result might lead consumers to continue to 
look for substantial savings on their prescription 
medications by seeking products 
outside the legalized importation system, 
just as some do now. We continue to observe 
that many consumers buy drugs from foreign 
Internet sources even though generic 
versions of those products are approved by 
FDA and such products are generally cheaper 
in the United States than abroad. 

We note that legalizing commercial importation 
may have unintended effects on protection 
of intellectual property and may reduce 
incentives for research and development, 
as noted in the 2004 report issued by 
the Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Task 
Force Report on Drug Importation. 

SAFETY CONCERNS 

We have safety concerns related to both 
the identification of unsafe and or non-compliant 
drug products and about the substitutability 
of foreign products for domestic 
products. 

Identifying unsafe/non-compliant drug products 

The section of the bill that would allow individuals 
to import a qualifying drug from a 
registered exporter would likely pose an 
overwhelming resource burden for the Agency 
and create significant safety concerns. 
Under such a program, the anticipated high 
volume of products would make it extremely 
difficult for FDA and U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection officials to examine adequately 
all of the personally imported drug 
products to ensure that they comply. In fact, 
the HHS Task Force estimated that it would 
have cost $3 billion annually to examine and 
process each of the 10 million packages that 

entered the U.S. in 2003. Even if a lower level 
of examination were considered adequate, 
the costs to FDA would still be very high. 

Despite its registration and inspection fee 
provisions, the bill likely provides inadequate 
resources to conduct such examination 
on a routine basis. Resources are limited 
to 2.5 percent of the total price of qualifying 
drugs imported by registered exporters, 
an amount likely to be a small fraction of 
the cost of inspecting packages at international 
mail facilities. This is a particular 
concern because, once personal importation 
is given the appearance of legality, consumers 
may be less vigilant in scrutinizing 
the drug shipments they receive from 
abroad. 

S. 242 would establish a complicated system 
for the regulation of imported drugs. 
This complex system is so vast that it would 
be enormously resource-intensive, likely 
much greater than the proposed registration 
fees and inspection fees could support. The 
bill and its associated fees also do not appear 
to account for the costs of the increased volume 
of packages likely to inundate the U.S., 
or address the accompanying and likely substantial 
enforcement work that will arise as 
a result of legalized importation as more unscrupulous 
vendors set up shop to circumvent 
the new U.S. system. 
Lack of substitutability 

The proposed bill provides a mechanism for 
foreign imported products to be approved for 
distribution in the U.S. even though these 
products may not be bioequivalent to the 
FDA-approved product. This mechanism 
seems to by-pass the existing drug approval 
process for drug products that are not bioequivalent 
to an FDA-approved product, 
which is through the submission of a new 
drug application (NDA) that is thoroughly 
reviewed for safety and efficacy. Ultimately, 
the bill appears to establish for imported 
drugs an alternative to FDA’s existing generic 
drugs program. 

The bill would allow non-bioequivalent 
products to be sold in the U.S. as approved 
‘‘variations’’ of the innovator product under 
the existing NDA, which would create confusion 
for doctors and pharmacists in prescribing 
or dispensing, respectively. Dr. Todd 
Cecil of the U.S. Pharmacopeia testified at 
the April 2005 Senate HELP hearing regarding 
pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence 
and his concerns with this bill. 
In addition, doctors cannot anticipate which 
version of a drug product their patients will 
receive, and pharmacists may not know 
which version of a drug the doctor intended 
to prescribe. The possibility of confusion is 
significant and poses a real public health 
concern as this increases the chance of error 
in prescribing and/or dispensing of medications. 
In addition, the domestic and foreign 
versions of prescription drugs may become 
commingled in the drug supply chain. It is 
unclear whether a patient will be able to 
specify if he wants the foreign version or the 
original FDA-approved version when he gets 
his prescription filled at the pharmacy or receives 
medication at a hospital or other 
medical treatment facility. 

INADEQUATE RESOURCES 
It is uncertain whether the anticipated fee 
revenues will be realized because the market 
response to legalization of importation cannot 
be accurately predicted. This uncertainty 
could pose problems for FDA’s program, 
because large costs of starting and developing 
a program to regulate imports will 
have to be incurred even if the volume of legalized 
imports is initially low. Although the 
bill does assume certain sales volumes in the 
first several years for purposes of collecting 
inspection fees, with only a few registered 
importers and exporters participating ini


tially, the high pro rata share of fees may 
actually discourage participation and make 
it difficult for FDA to collect fees at the designated 
levels. Even once a program is developed, 
the bill is not likely to provide the necessary 
funds to continue an adequate regulatory 
program if inspection fees are low because 
imports do not reach the anticipated 
levels. 

SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY 
We are proud of FDA’s efforts with supply 
chain stakeholders and states to maintain a 
safe and secure drug supply in the U.S. that 
is premised on a closed, tightly regulated 
system. The type of drug importation program 
in the bill would increase the number 
of foreign entities FDA would have to monitor 
and regulate. It can be difficult for FDA 
enforcement to reach foreign entities violating 
our laws and regulations. This bill 
would open the door to more entities outside 
our domestic legal framework. We also have 
grave concerns for consumers who may be 
harmed from products from these foreign 
sources. The bill does not take into account 
protecting the rights of the consumer if they 
are injured after using one of these products. 
As we all agree, counterfeit drugs must be 
kept out of the U.S. drug supply chain. FDA 
is currently using its resources and authorities 
as efficiently as possible to secure the 
drug supply chain and protect American consumers 
from counterfeit and diverted drugs. 
Opening the U.S. drug distribution system to 
foreign markets would provide more opportunity 
for counterfeit drugs to enter our currently 
closed system and would significantly 
complicate FDA’s efforts to investigate 
irregularities in the drug supply chain. 
Conducting foreign investigations and 
prosecutions is inherently costly and difficult 
and often is complicated by language 
barriers and issues of extraterritorial jurisdiction 
and extradition. We are concerned 
that the bill does not provide sufficient enforcement 
tools and penalties to deter foreign 
entities from introducing counterfeit or 
otherwise substandard drugs into the U.S. 
drug supply chain. 
APPROVAL OF FOREIGN VERSIONS 
We believe the bill creates complicated application 
and inspection requirements for 
imported ‘‘foreign’’ versions of FDA-approved 
products. These requirements would 
be difficult to implement, as each foreign 
country has its own regulatory scheme and 
requirements for the information necessary 
to approve a drug product. FDA would essentially 
have to review foreign information in 
a foreign format, all in less time than is required 
for review of traditional NDAs. In addition, 
the bill would require imported ‘‘foreign’’ 
versions of a drug bear the labeling associated 
with the original FDA-approved 
product. This practice would essentially legalize 
the misbranding of these products, and 
raises concerns for FDA not only in the approval 
context but also in the counterfeits 
context. It is difficult enough for FDA and 
other federal enforcement agencies to detect 
counterfeit drug products and packaging; 
creating a mechanism that would allow persons 
to label foreign drugs with reproductions 
of FDA-approved labeling would make 
it even harder to distinguish between ‘‘legal’’ 
foreign products and counterfeits. 

U.S. consumers currently have a number of 
options available to them when looking for 
affordable medications within the closed 
U.S. drug distribution system. Many essential 
drugs have a generic alternative and 
some even have many generics, which are 
generally less expensive than the brand product. 
We continue to find that many consumers 
currently buying foreign products 
are actually trying to purchase, or are unknowingly 
receiving, a foreign product that 

May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5385 

often is more expensive than the U.S. product. 
In addition, the consumers are at risk 
when receiving foreign drug products, as 
there are documented cases where the wrong 
medication was received (the haloperidol 
case mentioned in my testimony). Many 
pharmaceutical companies and Pharmaceutical 
Research and Manufacturers Association 
of America offer discounts and sometimes 
even free medications for consumers 
who cannot afford them. Medicare Part D 
has also helped some seniors cut their prescription 
costs. Consumers should not feel 
restricted to higher priced innovator (brand) 
products. 

Consumers must also understand that if a 
medication is costly, they should discuss 
other treatment options with their doctor 
and pharmacist, as most often there are 
lower-cost alternatives available. We will 
continue to strive to make more affordable 
medicines available to consumers, but we remain 
concerned about the implications of legalizing 
drug importation as one of those options. 


In conclusion, I would like to reiterate 
concerns about the economic implications of 
prescription drug importation, as stated in 
the 2004 HHS Task Force Report on Drug Importation. 
Even if all the safety concerns 
could be allayed, these concerns would remain: 
that savings to U.S. consumers would 
be small as a percent of total drug spending; 
that implementing such a program would 
incur significant costs; and that legalized 
importation would likely adversely affect 
the future development of new drugs for 
American consumers. In 2004, the HHS Task 
Force Report noted that generic drugs account 
for most prescription drugs used in the 

U.S. and that these are usually less expensive 
in the U.S. than abroad. We thus have a 
well-functioning system of intellectual property 
rights that balances the short-term interests 
of consumers with the long-term research 
incentives. 
Thank you for the opportunity to address 
some of our concerns with S. 242. 
Sincerely, 
RANDALL W. LUTTER, 

Acting Deputy Commissioner for Policy. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The Republican leader is recognized. 


Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to proceed as 
in morning business. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 


EXONERATION OF SENATOR FRIST 

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, a 
great injustice has come to an end. I 
rise to recognize the clearing of a good 
man’s name. 

Former Senator Bill Frist, with 
whom I and my Republican colleagues 
had the honor of serving for 12 years in 
the Senate, was cleared last week of 
every allegation of wrongdoing related 
to his ownership and sale of stock 
while serving as majority leader. 

I rise because, with the exception of 
an editorial in this morning’s Wall 
Street Journal, the clearing of this 
good and honorable man’s name has 
gone largely unreported. 

It is a sad fact of political life in 
America that the mere allegation of 
wrongdoing—the mere allegation of 
wrongdoing—has the power to tarnish 
someone’s name and dog them for 

years. But worse still is the silence 
that so often greets the vindication of 
the accused. 

I remember the rush to judgment 
that followed the allegations. I remember 
the memo Democrats sent out attacking 
Bill on ethical grounds. The 
authors were later forced to apologize, 
but the piece had its intended effect. 

Republicans knew then—and everyone 
now knows—those allegations were 
absolutely false. But the damage, of 
course, was already done. As the Journal 
writers put it today: 

Despite flimsy evidence, the media storm 
cast a shadow over [Frist’s] office . . . [and] 
the Nashville heart surgeon chose . . . to 
take a sabbatical from public life.— 

[And] Dr. Frist now joins a long line of 
public servants to be smeared on page one 
and [then] exonerated next to the classifieds, 
only to wonder if anyone noticed. 

Well, his friends noticed. Still, it is 
hard not to lament the damage these 
reckless claims have caused—caused 
for Bill, his family, and potentially our 
political system. 

The Founders envisioned a nation in 
which citizen legislators would be willing 
to leave the plow and the workbench 
to serve. 

Bill embodied this ideal by leaving 
his profession and the comforts of private 
life for a career of public service. 
He graced this body with his intelligence, 
his thoughtfulness, and his vision. 


We can only hope that future citizen 
legislators, and judges, are not deterred 
from entering and elevating politics 
because of the threat of similar 
treatment. 

A great American statesman once 
said: 

Reputation is like fine china and glass— 
easy to crack, but hard to mend. 

We hope a political culture that allowed 
the abuse of Bill Frist’s good 
name for political gain does not deter 
others from choosing the same path 
that he chose—and so honorably followed. 


Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the editorial entitled ‘‘Frist’s 
Vindication’’ from today’s Wall Street 
Journal be printed in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 

[From the Wall Street Journal, May 1, 2007] 
FRIST’S VINDICATION 
When insider-trading allegations against 
former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist 
surfaced back in 2005, they were splashed on 
the pages of major newspapers from coast to 
coast. Now that Dr. Frist has been vindicated, 
the silence is instructive. Is anybody 
out there? 
Senator Frist was alleged to have received 
an insider tip and then sold shares in a hospital 
company run by members of his family. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission 
and Justice Department investigated for 18 
months, and last week the SEC announced 
that it had closed its probe without taking 
action—that is, the doctor was cleared. 
Thanks in part to his meticulous email archives, 
Dr. Frist was able to show that he 
had begun the process of selling his HCA 
stock in April of 2005, months before he was 
alleged to have received the inside whispers. 

The controversy surrounding his involvement 
in health care was a perennial bugaboo 
for Dr. Frist. For years he was harassed by 
such liberal lobbies as Public Citizen, and 
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in 
Washington, which alleged conflicts of interest. 
These groups objected even to those 
stocks he held in the blind trust he had created 
to avoid the appearance of a conflict of 
interest. Yet when he sold those stocks, with 
a possible eye on higher office, he was pilloried 
for doing what the ethicists had asked 
him to do all along. 

Today, even this muted absolution is surely 
a relief to Dr. Frist. Yet it’s impossible to 
undo the damage to his political career. Despite 
flimsy evidence, the media storm cast 
a shadow over his office, derailing any 
thought of a Presidential bid this year. The 
Nashville heart surgeon chose instead to 
‘‘take a sabbatical from public life.’’ 

Democrats naturally cared less about the 
actual facts than about pinning another 
scandal on Congressional Republicans in the 
run-up to the fall elections. But what about 
others who thought it clever or funny or perhaps 
mandatory to get their share of media 
attention by confusing accusation with proof 
of wrongdoing? 

American University Professor James 
Thurber got his name in the paper for 
quipping that Senator Frist ‘‘came in like 
Jimmy Stewart and was leaving like Martha 
Stewart.’’ What a card. As for the press 
corps, it ran off in a braying stampede in 
pursuit of the theme dujour, which was 
Abramoff-DeLay-GOP corruption. The accusations 
against Dr. Frist fit that template, 
so there was no need for the herd of independent 
minds to inspect the evidence and 
make distinctions. A Washington Post editorial 
from the day now looks especially embarrassing—
and unfair. 

As a medical professional with strong Tennessee 
roots, Bill Frist was the kind of person 
we’d hope would occasionally choose to 
participate in politics, as opposed to the permanent 
political class that now dominates 
Congress. That his previous engagement in 
the real world, even carefully and transparently 
managed, made him an unfair target 
of political attacks shows why so few 
people of accomplishment run for office. 
These are the kind of people that the goo-goo 
Naderites and their media acolytes end up 
driving from public life. 

Dr. Frist now joins a long line of public 
servants to be smeared on page one and exonerated 
next to the classifieds, only to wonder 
if anyone noticed. As former U.S. Secretary 
of Labor Ray Donovan asked after his 
legal ordeal, ‘‘Which office do I go to to get 
my reputation back?’’ 

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
yield the floor. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The assistant majority leader is 
recognized. 

IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL 

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, about 1 
hour ago, the President of the United 
States vetoed the supplemental appropriations 
bill for the war in Iraq. It was 
a bill that we have worked on in Congress 
since its arrival in the middle of 
February. It was the subject of lengthy 
deliberations. There were long debates 
on the floor of the House and Senate. 
There was a lot of compromise that led 
to the final work product and a bipartisan 
vote which sent it to the President. 


There were people who were skeptical 
as to whether the Senate and the House 


S5386 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

of Representatives could rise to this 
challenge. In a nation that is so divided 
on so many political issues, in a nation 
where the war in Iraq is the biggest 
issue by far, there were serious doubts 
as to whether this Congress, with scant 
majorities of Democrats in both the 
House and the Senate, could produce a 
bill for President Bush to consider. 

Congress rose to that occasion. With 
the leadership of Speaker PELOSI and 
the leadership of our majority leader, 
Harry Reid of Nevada, we produced a 
bill which attracted not only the overwhelming 
support of the Democratic 
caucus but also the support of Republican 
Senators who joined us in passing 
this bill. 

It was our hope that our work product 
would be considered seriously by 
the President. It was sent to him this 
afternoon. A few hours after receiving 
it, the President vetoed it and announced 
his veto in a public press conference. 


I am disappointed. The President had 
a chance to sign a bill that would have 
funded the troops in this war. More importantly, 
it was a bill he could have 
signed which could have changed the 
course of this war—something that is 
long overdue. 

I listened in my office as the President 
gave his veto message to the 
American people. It was short, direct 
but, in many ways inadequate when 
you consider the awesome responsibility 
we face in Congress and in the 
White House. 

The President referred to our timetable 
to start bringing American 
troops home as a date for failure. It is 
ironic the President would make that 
statement on the fourth anniversary of 
his appearance on the USS Lincoln aircraft 
carrier under a banner announcing, 
4 years ago, that our mission was 
accomplished. For the President to announce 
success and failure, accomplishment 
and lack of accomplishment, 
leaves something to be desired after 
that experience 4 years ago. 

I am particularly troubled as well by 
the President’s notion of what this bill 
was all about. You see, he said, at one 
point, for us to set a timetable to bring 
American troops home would—in the 
President’s words—‘‘demoralize the 
Iraqi people.’’ Those were his words. 

Mr. President, excuse me, but I am 
not as interested in building up the 
morale of the Iraqi people as I am in 
inspiring the leaders of the nation to 
stand up and lead. For too long now, 
with the protection of the U.S. troops, 
this Iraqi Government has failed to 
make even basic progress in taking 
control of their country. They have 
failed to address the key political 
issues that would lead to stability. 

So the President is arguing that if we 
continue to send 150,000 or more American 
soldiers to risk their lives, it will 
build up the morale of the Iraqi people 
to seek nationhood, stability, and 
peace. So we expect American soldiers 
to stand in this crossfire of a bitter religious 
and civil war, hoping that the 

Iraqi people will be inspired enough to 
ask their Government for leadership? 

Mr. President, 3,351 American soldiers 
have fought and died in Iraq, as I 
stand here today. Mr. President, 3,351 
American lives should be enough to inspire 
the Iraqi people and their Government. 
How many more American lives 
will it take for that inspiration the 
President is looking for? 

I am troubled by this notion that unless 
we will sacrifice our treasure and 
the lives of our brave soldiers, the 
Iraqis cannot rise to the occasion and 
lead themselves out of this morass. 

I also listened to the President when 
he characterized the money that we 
added in Congress to his budget request. 
He called it—and I will quote— 
‘‘billions in nonemergency spending 
that has nothing to do with fighting 
the war on terror.’’ 

I wonder if the President’s staff put 
the bill in front of him for him to take 
a close look at, in the few hours he had 
it before vetoing the bill. 

Is the President arguing to the American 
people that providing $2 billion 
more in equipment to keep our troops 
safe in Iraq has nothing to do with 
fighting the war on terror? 

Is the President arguing that the $1 
billion in our supplemental appropriations 
bill—the $1 billion to replenish 
National Guard equipment destroyed 
and lost in the war in Iraq—that $1 billion 
has nothing to do with the war on 
terror? 

Is the President arguing that the $2 
billion in this bill for military hospitals—
such as Walter Reed, so we do 
not relegate our fallen soldiers and 
those who were injured to a flophouse 
motel across Georgia Avenue from 
Walter Reed Hospital—is he arguing 
that the $2 billion that is in the bill for 
military hospitals has nothing to do 
with the war on terror? 

Perhaps the President is not aware of 
the fact there was $2 billion in this bill 
for veterans hospitals all across America, 
for those who have come home 
with post-traumatic stress disorder, 
traumatic brain injury, and amputations 
who need the services of the VA 
hospitals. Is the President arguing that 
money for VA hospitals has ‘‘nothing 
to do with the war on terror’’? That is 
what he said. That is an exact quote. 

This bill has add-ons that relate to 
real emergencies in America. I have 
outlined a few related directly to the 
war on terror, directly to our troops, 
directly to our national security. 

There is money, as well, for the base 
closing commission, which it is my understanding 
the President wanted included. 
There is money, as well, for 
Hurricane Katrina. Here we are, a year 
and a half after that terrible tragedy, 
still trying to put New Orleans back on 
its feet and rebuild Louisiana and Mississippi 
and areas affected by Katrina 
and Rita. Yes, there is money in the 
bill for those emergency purposes. 

For the President to dismiss this as 
billions in nonemergency spending suggests 
his staff did not do their job, they 

did not spell out to the President what 
was in that bill before he vetoed it. 

Well, the President knows—and he 
said as much—we do not have the votes 
to override his veto. That is a reality. 
It takes 67 votes in the Senate. We 
have been able to rally 51 or 52 votes on 
a good day to question the President’s 
policies in Iraq. Two or three Republican 
Senators have stood by our side 
on the Democratic side of the aisle. 
Few others have been willing to do so. 
So the thought of reaching 67 votes is 
probably a bridge too far. I think we 
know that reality. 

But this much I will say: Congress 
cannot override the President’s veto, 
but the President cannot override the 
reality of Iraq. The reality of Iraq is 
this: We are in the fifth year of a war. 
We have seen 3,351 American lives sacrificed, 
25,000 or more injured, 7,000 or 
8,000 seriously injured with traumatic 
brain injury and amputations. 

Americans have sacrificed from their 
hard work and earnings $500 billion for 
this war and for rebuilding Iraq. That 
is the reality of Iraq today. 

The reality is, this last month of 
April was the deadliest month this 
year for American soldiers. The reality 
is, this President has no plan to exit 
that country and bring our troops 
home. That is the reality. We may not 
be able to override this veto, but the 
President cannot override those realities. 


Now it is time for the American people 
to understand what happens next. 

We will fund these troops. We have 
made that promise, and we will keep it. 
They will not be bargaining chips in 
our policy debate in Washington. But 
we will continue, through this bill and 
through other legislation this year, to 
continue to put the issue of the Iraq 
war in front of the President, in front 
of the American people. They expect 
nothing less. 

For those who are frustrated by the 
President’s veto today, I join them in 
that frustration. But I join them, as 
well, in believing that as the American 
people speak out on this issue, the likelihood 
that Republicans will cross this 
aisle and join us increases. 

The time will come—I am not sure 
when but I hope soon—that tipping 
point will be reached where the Republicans 
finally say to their President: 
Enough. We cannot ignore the reality 
of this war and what it has done to 
America. Then they will join us. Then 
this will truly become a bipartisan effort. 
Then we will be able to override 
vetoes and pass legislation that will 
make a meaningful change in the policy 
of this war. 

I encourage those across America 
seeking a new direction in Iraq, do not 
be discouraged by this veto. There will 
be another day. There will be another 
bill. There will be another chance for 
us to change this policy. We need to 
keep our forces together—the forces for 
change in Iraq on the Democratic side 
and on the Republican side. We cannot 
allow the President’s veto pen to be the 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5387 

last word on this war in Iraq. We have 
to stand together, and we have to work 
together. 

The President comes up with rosy reports 
on what is happening in Iraq. But 
we know the reality. Sectarian deaths 
are down, he said. Well, I guess they 
are down slightly, a small percentage, 
of those innocent civilians killed last 
month. There were fewer this month. I 
guess that is progress. But those who 
are there say the violence is subsiding 
while the surge is underway, and they 
are afraid it will return. I am, too. 

We need to pass a bill for the troops, 
and sometime soon. We will work hard 
to try to find a way with the President. 
He has invited the leadership of the 
Senate and the House to meet with him 
tomorrow in the White House. I have 
been to those meetings before. There 
have been little results to point to for 
the time we have met and the dialog 
we have exchanged. But I go tomorrow 
with the hope that things will be different. 
I hope this President, after his 
moment in the sun with this veto, will 
now understand that we face the grim 
reality of Iraq, and the reality that we 
have no exit plan. This failed policy in 
Iraq must come to an end. We will continue 
to fight, with this democratic 
Congress, to make a change in that 
policy. We will stand by our soldiers, 
but we will not stand by a failed policy. 
I am encouraged by the fact that so 
many of my colleagues are ready to 
continue this fight, and I encourage 
the American people: Don’t give up. 
Don’t lose heart. This democracy 
works when you work with us to bring 
the will of the people to the law of the 
land. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The senior Senator from New 
York is recognized. 

IRAQ SUPPLEMENTAL 

Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, tonight 
is a sad night for America, but 
what the President’s veto indicated 
was not that Democrats don’t want to 
support the troops—we do—but that he 
does not want a change in direction, a 
change in mission, a change in course. 
It indicates the President is still in his 
bunker thinking everything is going 
fine in Iraq, and it clearly isn’t. 

The bottom line is very simple: We 
can do two things at once. We can support 
the troops and at the same time 
we can change our mission. The bottom 
line is simple, and that is that the 
present policies have failed. Everyone 
except a handful of supporters of the 
President, and the President and the 
Vice President themselves, know that, 
but unfortunately they stubbornly 
cling to staying on the same course, to 
the detriment of about everybody else 
in this country and the world. 

The bottom line is very simple: that 
President Bush, when he asked Americans 
to go to war, never talked about 
policing a civil war, and yet that is the 
largest part of our efforts in Iraq. We 
on this side of the aisle hope to change 
that direction so that we are fighting 

terrorism and directing counterterrorism 
and not simply policing a civil war. 

The next few weeks will be momentous 
in our history. Frankly, when 
these few weeks began, the President, 
with his bully pulpit, his harsh rhetoric, 
his idea that he was trying to persuade 
people we didn’t support the 
troops, many thought he would win the 
fight—the fight here in this Chamber 
and in the minds of public opinion. But 
that hasn’t happened at all. In fact, the 
American people are so disgruntled by 
this war in Iraq, that the old name-
calling, the old kneecapping, the old 
attempts to instill fear in people who 
disagreed with him don’t work for this 
President anymore. He has only one 
choice. That choice is a simple one, 
which is to change the course of the 
war in Iraq. It is inevitable. It will happen. 
It will happen sooner or it will 
happen later, but it must happen because 
failed policies can never continue 
on and on and on. 

They have asked us to have faith in 
the surge. If it won’t work with 150,000 
troops, it won’t work with 180,000 
troops, and it won’t work because the 
Government in Iraq does not have the 
support of the people, is unable to accomplish 
any goals, is unable to bring 
Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds together. It 
doesn’t matter how many troops we 
have there; the bottom line is simple. 
Our President is in the twilight days of 
his administration, and he has only 
two choices. One is to do what his predecessor 
Ronald Reagan did: See that 
things have gone off course and seek a 
correction. Ronald Reagan did that in 
1986, and by 1988 the wall came down 
and Ronald Reagan had restored the 
faith of the American people. Why this 
President can’t see the necessity to do 
the same when his policies, if anything, 
are in far worse shape than those of 
President Reagan, speaks either to an 
inability to sense what is going on or a 
stubbornness despite the facts. We 
can’t tolerate that. 

We here tonight make a pledge to the 
American people. We will continue this 
struggle to change our direction in 
Iraq. We will not run away from fighting 
terrorism. We believe it every bit 
as fervently as anybody else, but we 
will also not run away from fighting 
terrorism smartly, which is what we 
are not doing here. 

So we will continue to try to reach a 
compromise with this President, to try 
to figure out a way we can both support 
the troops and change the course 
of the war in Iraq in maybe a different 
way, but we will not give up on our 
mission. The American people demand 
no less and we will not disappoint 
them. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The clerk will call the roll. 

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The majority leader is recognized. 


Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 


SENATOR FRIST’S VINDICATION 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had the 
good fortune of working with Senator 
Bill Frist for 4 years as a leader. He 
was a leader. There were times he and 
I had some political disagreements, 
and that is an understatement, but on 
a personal basis we had no misunderstandings. 
He was in public service for 
the right reason. He was a very fine, 
outstanding, nationally recognized 
transplant surgeon. He comes from a 
good family. He and I had many discussions, 
personal in nature. He was always 
available to anyone in the Senate. 
When there were any medical problems 
involved, he was always there to 
give advice and counsel. I went to him 
on many occasions about situations involving 
my friends and he would lay 
things out for me and head me in the 
right direction. 

Senator Frist had a situation arise 
front page in many of the newspapers, 
problems with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. Senator Frist 
comes from a family that has done 
well. They have been involved in health 
care for many years. He and I had conversations 
about this and he said at the 
time it was unfair. He had to spend a 
lot of money hiring lawyers and accountants 
and consultants. 

This matter was closed yesterday, 
but the closing of this in the newspapers 
and on the news was certainly 
not the top story, not at the top of the 
newspaper. It was buried some place in 
the back. At no time during my conversations 
with Senator Frist or in my 
dealings with Senator Frist did I ever 
have any doubt about his integrity. 

His wife Karen and my wife are good 
friends. They worked together on a 
number of activities that Senate 
spouses work on. They had to do things 
because Senator Frist and I were the 
two leaders of the Senate and they did 
them together based on our relationship. 


I extend to Senator Frist my congratulations 
on getting this put behind 
him. I want the RECORD to be spread 
with the fact that I know this was a 
difficult time for him on occasion, but 
never at any time did I doubt his integrity, 
his honesty. I will long remember 
Senator Frist and I appreciate my dealings 
with him over these many years. 

CLOTURE MOTION 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a 
cloture motion to the desk. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The cloture motion having been 
presented under rule XXII, the Chair 
directs the clerk to read the motion. 

The legislative clerk read as follows: 
CLOTURE MOTION 
We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance 
with the provisions of rule 


S5388 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, 
hereby move to bring to a close debate 
on the Dorgan amendment No. 990 
to S. 1082, the FDA Revitalization bill. 
Byron L. Dorgan, Dick Durbin, Claire 

McCaskill, John Kerry, Ted Kennedy, 

Amy Klobuchar, Sherrod Brown, Ken 

Salazar, Mark Pryor, Daniel K. Inouye, 

Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid, Ron 

Wyden, Dianne Feinstein, Carl Levin, 

Blanche L. Lincoln. 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a 
cloture motion on Senator DORGAN’s 
longstanding endeavor to allow Americans 
to go to other countries for the 
importation of cheaper drugs. We know 
people are going to Canada now from 
around the country who live on the 
border, and it works pretty well. But if 
you are someone who lives in Nevada, 
you certainly need these drugs as well 
as someone living in Minnesota, and it 
makes it much more difficult. Nevadans 
go to Mexico a lot of times for 
cheaper drugs. It is unfortunate. 

Senator DORGAN is right. He has 
worked on this very hard for a number 
of years. This is an effort to bring this 
matter to a close. I hope the Senate 
votes to invoke cloture so we can have 
a vote on this amendment. It is important. 
I am confident it will pass if cloture 
is invoked. It is something that 
has been needed for such a long time to 
help in one way to lower the cost of 
medicine for the American public.

MORNING BUSINESS 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent there now be a period of 
morning business with Senators allowed 
to speak therein for a period of 
up to 10 minutes each.

Without objection, it is so ordered.

HONORING STEVEN SCHWARZ 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week I 
attended a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda 
to commemorate the 2007 Holocaust 
Days of Remembrance. 

Fred Zeidman and Joel Geiderman, 
Chairman and Vice Chairman of the 

U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, 
spoke eloquently about the horror and 
courage, the unspeakable tragedy and 
unimaginable heroism that even 62 
years later we cannot begin to comprehend. 
Sara Bloomfield, Director of the U.S. 
Holocaust Memorial Museum, as well 
as my colleague, Senator JOE 
LIEBERMAN, added their own powerful 
words. 

I was privileged to sit beside Steven 
Schwarz. As we sat together, Steven 
listened silently, tears streaming down 
his face. Afterward, he told me his 
story. 

Born in Poland, Steven lost both parents 
and a brother in the Holocaust. 
Forged with sheer willpower and blessings 
from God, he, his late wife Tina, 
and his brother Henryk managed to 
survive by hiding out in Poland. In 

1953, they came to the United States 
and were welcomed with open arms. In 
the years that followed, Steven and his 
brother rose to become prominent and 
successful businessmen, overcoming 
great suffering to live the American 
dream. 

Steven Schwarz embodies the grace 
and fortitude of all those who wrested 
triumph from despair. I am honored to 
have shared that day of remembrance 
with him and pleased to now pay tribute 
to his life story in the RECORD of 
the U.S. Congress as a powerful and 
poignant example of the unbreakable 
human spirit.

AAA SCHOOL SAFETY 
PATROLLERS 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to 
recognize several young people who 
were recently selected by the American 
Automobile Association to receive special 
awards for their work as school 
safety patrollers. 

More than 560,000 students in 52,000 
schools across the country participate 
in AAA’s School Safety Patrol Program. 
These young people have taken 
on the important responsibility of 
making the streets around their 
schools safer for their classmates. 
Though their responsibilities are often 
routine, the patrollers on occasion 
must place themselves in harm’s way 
in order to save lives. It is my honor 
today to recognize two students who 
were selected to receive the AAA Lifesaver 
Award for their selfless and heroic 
actions in fulfilling their duties as 
patrollers. 

Taylor Pitzer and Caleb Jarrell participate 
in the AAA School Safety Patrol 
Program at Southdale Elementary 
in Kettering, OH. On November 8, 2006, 
Taylor and Caleb pulled a younger 
child to safety when a speeding van ran 
the red light at the intersection they 
were patrolling. The younger child was 
watching carefully for the ‘‘walk’’ signal. 
When the light changed, she began 
crossing the street and did not notice 
the oncoming vehicle approaching the 
intersection. Responding to an adult 
guard’s ‘‘hold back’’ indication, Taylor 
and Caleb reacted quickly by locking 
arms so the child could not cross the 
street, which allowed the van to speed 
by without incident or injury to the 
child. 

I would also like to thank AAA for 
making the school safety program possible. 
This program has helped save 
many lives over the years and has 
made our schools safer for our students, 
though, as the story of the Life 
Saver Award recipients demonstrate, 
the streets around our schools are not 
safe enough. That is why I worked to 
create the national Safe Routes to 
School Program, which was adopted as 
part of the Federal transportation bill 
on July 29, 2005. Funds for this program 
can help communities construct new 
bike lanes, pathways, and sidewalks, as 
well as launch Safe Routes education 
and promotion campaigns in elementary 
and middle schools. 

I am pleased to commend this important 
program today before the Senate. 
I know I speak for every member of the 
Senate in expressing our gratitude for 
their valuable work in our communities.

NORTHERN NEVADA CENTER FOR 
INDEPENDENT LIVING 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to 
honor the Northern Nevada Center for 
Independent Living, NNCIL. I am honored 
to congratulate this organization 
for their 25 years of dedicated service 
to the people of northern Nevada. 

NNCIL has helped disabled citizens in 
Nevada in all aspects of their lives. 
They have empowered disabled citizens 
to become more independent and have 
given disabled people a stronger voice 
in matters that directly affect their 
lives. With the skills taught by NNCIL, 
disabled people who were benefactors 
of this program are now participating 
fully in the community by volunteering 
in the center and in other service 
agencies across Nevada. 

NNCIL has helped disabled citizens 
thrive socially as well. The center has 
instituted ‘‘recreation night’’ that has 
helped disabled people form peer support 
groups. They have incorporated 
game night and movie night into their 
organization to build communities 
throughout Nevada. 

The efforts of NNCIL have garnered 
broad respect and support from the 
community as a whole. NNCIL has incorporated 
multiple programs to educate 
the public concerning issues concerning 
disabled citizens. They have 
encouraged Nevada residents to get involved 
in their communities, and the 
citizens of northern Nevada have responded 
by volunteering in a home-
modification program that has helped 
install ramps, handrails, and other improvements 
to make life easier for disabled 
people. 

I would like to commend NNCIL for 
their many years of dedicated service 
to the people of Nevada. They have 
been an important part of improving 
the lives of disabled members of our 
community, and I wish them continued 
success.

RECOGNIZING NEVADA’S 45TH 
ANNUAL RENO JAZZ FESTIVAL 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to 
recognize the 45th annual Reno Jazz 
Festival. Hosted by the University of 
Nevada, Reno, the Festival has grown 
into one of the largest of its kind in 
the United States, with over 10,000 people 
attending last year’s event. 

The competition portions are one the 
highlights of the festival. Musical 
groups and individuals from junior 
highs, high schools, and colleges from 
throughout the country are invited to 
participate. The festival winner and 
other highly acclaimed musical groups 
will perform at the festival’s showcase 
on its concluding day. 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5389 

Clinics will also be offered at the festival 
to help developing musicians improve 
their abilities and talents. Jazz 
students have a unique opportunity to 
meet with and learn from some of the 
most talented musicians and educators 
in the Nation. 

Jazz has come a long way since I first 
listened to the music as a boy on the 
radio in Searchlight. This distinct musical 
form has developed from its humble 
origins in early 20th century New 
Orleans to touch music fans of all ages 
and backgrounds today. The personalities 
of the early days of Jazz continue 
to influence today’s artists across the 
musical spectrum. 

I wish the host and participants of 
the Reno Jazz Festival continued success 
in bringing Jazz to all members of 
the community.

HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES 

STAFF SERGEANT KENNETH LOCKER 

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to 
express my sympathy over the loss of 

U.S. Army SSG Kenneth Locker of 
Burwell, NE. Sergeant Locker was 
killed on April 23 in Diyala province, 
Iraq. He was 28 years old. 
Sergeant Locker graduated from 
Burwell High School in 1997. He enlisted 
with the Army while he was still 
in high school. Bob Lee, his high school 
math teacher, said that after he enlisted, 
Sergeant Locker became a much 
more focused young man whose grades 
shot up. 

After high school, Sergeant Locker 
spent 3 years in the Army, 2 years with 
the National Guard, and eventually reenlisted 
with the Army. He had been in 
Iraq since August 2006 with the Army’s 
historic 82nd Airborne Division. 

Sergeant Locker was previously injured 
in Iraq by a land mine. He was 
awarded a Purple Heart and lived with 
shrapnel in his neck. Thousands of 
brave men and women like Sergeant 
Locker are serving in Iraq. 

In addition to his life as a soldier, 
Sergeant Locker was father to three 
young sons and believed he was making 
a safer world for his children. He is also 
survived by his father Ken, two sisters, 
and a half sister and half brother. We 
are proud of his service to our country. 

I ask my colleagues to join me and 
all Americans in honoring SSG Kenneth 
Locker. 

FIRST LIEUTENANT KEVIN GASPERS 

I rise to express my sympathy over 
the loss of U.S. Army 1LT Kevin Gaspers 
of Hastings, NE. Lieutenant Gaspers 
was killed on Apri1 23 in Diya1a 
province, Iraq. He was 26 years old. 

Lieutenant Gaspers was a 2000 graduate 
of St. Cecilia High School in 
Hastings, where he wrestled and played 
football. After graduation, he attended 
the University of Nebraska at Lincoln 
and enrolled in the ROTC program. As 
a senior at UNL, Lieutenant Gaspers 
was selected to lead the ROTC cadet’s 
battalion. His colleagues remember 
him as low-key and professional in his 
leadership style. He earned his Army 
officer’s commission in 2005, along with 
a degree from UNL in accounting. 

Lieutenant Gaspers was a paratrooper 
with the Army’s historic 82nd 
Airborne Division based at Fort Bragg, 

N.C. He had been serving in Iraq since 
August 2006. 
Lieutenant Gaspers is survived by his 
parents, John and Pam, and sisters 
Katie and Audrey. We are proud of his 
service to our country. 

I ask my colleagues to join me and 
all Americans in honoring 1LT Kevin 
Gaspers.

HOLD ON INTERIOR DEPARTMENT 
NOMINATION 

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I 
have placed a hold on the nomination 
of R. Lyle Laverty to be Assistant Secretary 
for Fish, Wildlife and Parks at 
the U.S. Interior Department. Consistent 
with my policy of publicly announcing 
whenever I place a hold on a 
nomination, I want to notify my colleagues 
of my objection to allowing 
Mr. Laverty’s nomination to be considered 
under a unanimous-consent agreement. 
and to take a few minutes to explain 
to my colleagues why I am doing 
so. 

The Interior Department has suffered 
no shortage of scandals in recent years. 
To name just two of the most egregious: 
Its former No. 2 official, a Deputy 
Interior Secretary who previously 
had been a coal industry lobbyist, 
pleaded guilty earlier this year to fel


ony obstruction of justice for lying 
about his relationship with disgraced 
lobbyist Jack Abramoff. And we discovered 
that the Minerals Management 
Service, an agency within the Interior 
Department, has known for years 
about flawed drilling leases that allow 
companies to pay no royalties on valuable 
oil and gas they take from Federal 
land in the Gulf of Mexico, but the 
MMS did nothing until news reports 
brought the facts to the public last 
year. Indeed, the MMS has silenced 
auditors on its staff who tried to blow 
the whistle on companies not paying 
their fair share. 

‘‘Simply stated, short of a crime, 
anything goes at the highest levels of 
the Interior Department,’’ the Interior 
Department’s inspector general has 
warned us. 

Last year, when Dirk Kempthorne 
was nominated to be Secretary of the 
Interior and he appeared before the 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee for confirmation, I secured 
from him a pledge. He told me that he 
would reform that troubled department 
and introduce a higher ethical standard. 
The scandals would stop coming. 

However, in late March, the inspector 
general once again released a scathingly 
critical report warning us about 
bad things happening at the Interior 
Department. This time the subject was 
Julie MacDonald, Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks. 
Mr. Laverty would be the immediate 
supervisor of the position Ms. MacDonald 
held. 

In detail, the inspector general told 
us two things about Ms. MacDonald. 
One, she violated Federal rules by 
leaking internal Fish and Wildlife 
Service records to business groups actively 
challenging the Government’s 
environmental rulemaking process. In 
the process, she has been undermining 
her own agency’s cases in court. Two, 
without any formal education in the 
natural sciences, she has bullied and 
threatened FWS scientists and forced 
changes in their reports to suit her 
own political and personal agendas. 
FWS attorneys no longer will sign off 
on reports if they know the reports 
passed through her hands because they 
no longer are certain of the accuracy. 

This sort of conduct is simply unacceptable. 
If you agree to work in the 
Interior Department, your loyalty 
should be with the Interior Department 
and protecting this country’s natural 
treasures. Ms. MacDonald’s loyalty lay 
elsewhere. 

The inspector general sent his report 
on Ms. MacDonald to the Interior Department 
for administrative action 
more than a month ago. The Interior 
Department had no public comment. 
Only after I announced that I would 
place a hold on Mr. Laverty’s nomination 
did Ms. MacDonald resign. That 
removes her from the equation, but not 
the atmosphere that allowed her to operate 
as she did for so long. 


S5390 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

In case I wasn’t perfectly clear last 
year at his confirmation hearing, I 
want to be sure that Secretary Kempthorne 
knows that I am serious. The 
Interior Department has been a source 
of shame to this government for too 
long. It is failing in its mission to protect 
the public land and balance the 
needs of the American people with wisdom 
and integrity. It has stumbled 
from one misstep to another, from one 
scandal to another, and I have to question 
who is in charge over there. 

I want to hear from Secretary Kempthorne 
what action he plans to take to 
be certain that we won’t see this sort 
of problem again. I want to hear from 
Mr. Laverty what he would do, if he is 
confirmed to the post of Assistant Secretary, 
to end the politicization of the 
Fish and Wildlife Service. We cannot 
continue to have government scientists 
whose work is manipulated and conclusions 
are rewritten by political appointees. 
We cannot continue to have 
federal officials working secretly with 
groups challenging their own agencies. 

Until I receive these assurances, I 
will object to any unanimous consent 
agreement to allow Mr. Laverty’s nomination 
to come to a vote in the Senate.

IDAHO GUNFIGHTERS HONORED 

Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, on March 
30, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates 
announced that Mountain Home Air 
Force Base in my home State of Idaho 
had earned the coveted 2007 Commander 
in Chief’s Annual Award for Installation 
Excellence. This Presidential 
honor is given only to a single 
installation in each of the military 
branches for outstanding and innovative 
efforts by installation personnel. I 
am honored to be able to publicly herald 
this tremendous achievement by 
Colonel Rock and all the men and 
women of Mountain Home Air Force 
Base. 

This high honor reflects a sustained 
level of excellence by all the Gunfighters 
of Mountain Home. Installation 
of the Year can only be achieved if 
everyone, from the wing commander to 
airmen working in all aspects of operations 
and support, has their priorities 
straight and expectations for personal 
duty performance at the highest level. 
Improving the structures that protect 
valuable aircraft, creative and responsible 
financial management with regard 
to improving facilities, and a 
commitment to Air Force families are 
just some of the ways in which Mountain 
Home Air Force Base demonstrated 
its excellence this year. The 
Gunfighters have maintained this 
strong tradition of superiority and excellence 
for over half a century. The 
missions have changed over the years, 
but Gunfighter commitment and performance 
has not. 

Idahoans can be very proud of their 
Gunfighters. Mountain Home Air Force 
Base is as much a part of Idaho history 
as the magnificent valleys, rivers, and 

plateaus that surround the base. The 
366th Fighter Wing is a force to be 
reckoned with when it comes to the national 
security of the United States. 
The missions currently headquartered 
at Mountain Home comprise a vital 
component of our comprehensive military 
defensive and offensive force. 
Idaho is fortunate to be host and home 
to these defenders of freedom. 

Idaho benefits from Mountain Home 
Air Force Base, not just when the military 
men and women serving out their 
assignments there call our State 
‘‘home’’ for a time in their military careers 
but also when some return to call 
Idaho home permanently in retirement. 


I offer my sincere congratulations to 
the Gunfighters and my heartfelt gratitude 
for their service to our great 
country, in defense of my freedom and 
that of my family.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 

TRIBUTE TO BOB HUDSON 

S Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I 
would like to pay tribute to the public 
service of Bob Hudson, city manger of 
Farmington, NM. 

Bob first came to New Mexico in 1982 
to take on the job as director of parks, 
recreation & cultural affairs in Farmington. 
Since that time he has served 
the citizens of Farmington faithfully, 
eventually becoming city manager in 
1999. 

Bob’s commitment to the community 
of Farmington did not end with his official 
duties. He has also served on the 
boards of several local organizations 
including the Boys & Girls Club, the 
Farmington Inter-tribal Indian Organization, 
and the Chamber of Commerce. 

The citizens of Farmington are well 
aware of Bob’s contributions to their 
community and have honored him with 
numerous awards, including the New 
Mexico Distinguished Public Service 
Award in 1991 and the Elks Citizen of 
the Year award in 1995. Bob was also inducted 
into the History Makers Hall of 
Fame by the Farmington Chamber of 
Commerce in 2001 and the recipient of 
the 2005 Public Employee of the Year 
award. 

Bob is retiring in April to devote 
more time to his family, but I am sure 
his dedication to the community of 
Farmington will not end. I wish him 
the best in retirement and thank him 
for his long years of service.S

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 

By Mr. MCCAIN (for himself, Mr. 
KYL, Mr. THOMAS, and Mr. 
DOMENICI): 

S. 1255. A bill to protect Indian arts 
and crafts through the improvement of 
applicable criminal proceedings, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Indian Affairs. 
Mr. MCCAIN. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to be joined by my colleagues 
Senator THOMAS, Senator KYL, and 
Senator DOMENICI in introducing a bill 
to amend the Indian Arts and Crafts 
Act. This legislation would improve 
Federal laws that protect the integrity 
and originality of Native American 
arts and crafts. 

The Indian Arts and Crafts Act prohibits 
the misrepresentation in marketing 
of Indian arts and crafts products, 
and makes it illegal to display or 
sell works in a manner that falsely 

suggests it is the product of an individual 
Indian or Indian Tribe. 

Unfortunately, the law is written so 
that only the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
FBI, acting on behalf of the 
Attorney General, can investigate and 
make arrests in cases of suspected Indian 
art counterfeiters. The bill we are 
introducing would amend the law to 
expand existing Federal investigative 
authority by authorizing other Federal 
investigative bodies, such as the BIA 
Office of Law Enforcement, in addition 
to the FBI, to investigate cases of misrepresentation 
of Indian arts and 
crafts. This bill is similar to provisions 
included in the Native American Omnibus 
Act, S. 536, and S. 1375, which 
passed the Senate at the end of the last 
Congress but were not acted on by the 
House. 

A major source of tribal and individual 
Indian income is derived from 
the sale of handmade Indian arts and 
crafts. Yet millions of dollars are diverted 
each year from these original 
artists and Indian tribes by those who 
reproduce and sell counterfeit Indian 
goods. Few, if any, criminal prosecutions 
have been brought in Federal 
court for such violations. It is understandable 
that enforcing the criminal 
law under the Indian Arts and Crafts 
Act is often stalled by the other responsibilities 
of the FBI including investigating 
terrorism activity and violent 
crimes in Indian country. Therefore, 
expanding the investigative authority 
to include other Federal agencies 
is intended to promote the active 
investigation of alleged misconduct. It 
is my hope that this much needed 
change will deter those who choose to 
violate the law. 

I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 

By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. 
SNOWE, and Mr. LEVIN): 

S. 1256. A bill to amend the Small 
Business Act to reauthorize loan programs 
under that Act, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship. 
Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee 
on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
I rise today to join with Senator 
KERRY in introducing, the Small Business 
Lending Reauthorization and Improvement 
Act of 2007. This bill is especially 
timely considering the Nation 
recently celebrated National Small 
Business Week, and this body just 
passed the America COMPETES Act, a 
bill that invests in innovation and education 
to improve the competitiveness 
of the United States in the global economy. 


The impact small businesses have on 
our country’s economy and the technological 
innovations they create simply 
cannot be overstated. Small hi-tech 
firms represent the most innovative 
sector in America. According to the 
Small Business Administration’s Office 
of Advocacy, these businesses hold over 
40 percent of the Nation’s patents, obtain 
13 to 14 times more patents per 


S5394 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

employee than large businesses, and secure 
patents which are twice as technologically 
significant as larger firms. 
With American jobs and our security at 
stake, it is essential that we support 
innovation programs to meet national 
challenges in defense, healthcare, energy, 
and information technology. 

A critical partner for small businesses 
is the Small Business Administration, 
SBA, whose fundamental purpose 
is to ‘‘aid, counsel, assist, and protect 
the interests of small-business 
concerns.’’ The SBA’s methods for carrying 
out this mandate vary widely, 
but the agency’s primary tool is found 
in its small business lending programs. 
The SBA’s 7(a), 504, and Microloan programs 
are tailored to encourage small 
business growth and expansion. With 
small businesses representing 99 percent 
of all employers, creating nearly 
75 percent of all net new jobs, and employing 
51 percent of the private-sector 
workforce, it is essential that Congress 
affirms long-term stability in the lending 
programs the SBA provides to the 
small business community. 

As it has in the past, the SBA continues 
to meet the demands of small 
businesses, both in my home state of 
Maine and across the county. In fiscal 
Year 2006, the SBA backed a net 100,197 
loans totaling over $19.1 billion under 
the 7(a) and 504 programs. In fact, both 
the number of loans and the dollar 
amount represent record amounts for 
the agency—dramatically highlighting 
the significance of the SBA and the 
critical role it plays in our nation’s 
economy. 

The foundation for the bill Senator 
KERRY and I are introducing today 
started during the 109th Congress under 
an extensive reauthorization process 
which I led. This process ultimately 
culminated in the unanimous Small 
Business Committee passage of a comprehensive 
SBA reauthorization bill. I 
firmly believe that the Small Business 
Lending Reauthorization and Improvement 
Act of 2007 will help the SBA continue 
its legacy of achievement. 

The SBA’s loan and investment programs 
have produced success story 
after success story, which include assisting 
the founders of Intel, Staples, 
and Federal Express, as well as thousands 
of other successful businesses. 
Our bipartisan measure will build upon 
these past successes and make the SBA 
even more effective. As former Chair 
and now ranking member of the Small 
Business Committee, I believe we must 
do everything possible to sustain prosperity 
and job creation throughout the 
United States. To achieve that goal, I 
have long fought to solidify and expand 
the reach of the SBA’s programs that 
have helped millions of aspiring entrepreneurs 
and existing small businesses. 

Small businesses yearn to grow, 
flourish, and thrive, and the SBA has 
the experience and the resources to be 
their bridge to success. It is essential 
that we upgrade the SBA’s core lending 
programs for the 21st century entrepreneur. 
The American economy needs 

a strong and vibrant Small Business 
Administration. The Small Business 
Lending Reauthorization and Improvement 
Act of 2007 will build on the previous 
success of the Agency, and help 
to ensure the success of tomorrow’s entrepreneurs. 


By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, 
Mr. HATCH, and Mr. BENNETT): 

S. 1257. A bill to provide the District 
of Columbia a voting seat and the 
State of Utah an additional seat in the 
House of Representatives; to the Committee 
on Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs. 
Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I 
rise today with my colleague from 
Utah, Senator HATCH, to introduce bipartisan 
legislation that I believe is 
the breakthrough we have been searching 
for to bring House voting representation 
to the residents of the District 
of Columbia, who have historically 
been denied this fundamental birthright. 


I am proud to join with, DC Delegate 
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON and Representative 
TOM DAVIS, and the many 
others from both parties and both 
houses who have worked without rest 
to remedy the disenfranchisement of 
District residents since the capital was 
established in Washington in 1800. I especially 
want to thank my friend Senator 
HATCH for his influential support 
of this voting rights proposal, which 
would bring to an end a gross inconsistency 
with the founding principles of 
our Nation. 

Mr. President, we have a historic opportunity 
today to finally bestow upon 
the citizens of the District of Columbia 
the civic entitlement every other tax-
paying American citizen enjoys no 
matter where he or she resides, democracy’s 
most essential right, voting representation 
in Congress. 

The bill is simple. It would increase 
the number of voting representatives 
in the House from 435 to 437 by providing 
the District with a voting representative 
and by adding another congressional 
seat for Utah, the next State 
in line to increase its representation 
based on the 2000 Census. 

Working cooperatively in the spirit 
of service to the people of Washington, 
DC, and Utah, Congresswoman NORTON 
and Congressman DAVIS shepherded a 
similar proposal through the House 
Government Reform Committee on 
March 13 by a vote of 24–5. The full 
House approved the measure April 20 
by a vote of 241–177, a historic day unlike 
any other since 1978 when Congress 
approved a constitutional amendment 
to give District residents voting rights 
in the House and Senate. Of course, 
that amendment came to naught when 
too few States ratified it. 

The people of this city have waited 
far too long for this right. They have 
been the direct target of terrorist attacks, 
and yet they have no representative 
to vote in Congress on policies to 
protect their homeland security. Citizens 
of Washington, DC, pay income 

taxes just like everyone else. In fact, 
they pay more: Per capita, District 
residents have the second highest Federal 
tax obligation. And yet they have 
no voice in how high those taxes will 
be or how they will be spent. The District 
is also the only jurisdiction in the 
country that must seek congressional 
approval, through the appropriations 
process, before spending locally-generated 
tax dollars. When Congress fails 
to pass appropriations bills before the 
beginning of the fiscal year, the District’s 
budget is essentially frozen. And 
yet DC has no say in that appropriations 
process. 

DC residents fight and die for our democracy 
but they cannot participate 
fully in it. I ask you, how can we effectively 
promote democracy abroad 
while denying it to hundreds of thousands 
of citizens in our Nation’s Capital? 


There is no good reason why DC residents 
have been denied congressional 
representation. In 1800, when the nation’s 
capital was established as the 
District of Columbia, an oversight left 
the area’s residents without congressional 
representation. Maryland and 
Virginia ceded land for the capitol in 
1788 and 1789, respectively, but it took 
another 10 years for Congress to establish 
the District of Columbia. In the interim, 
residents continued to vote either 
in Maryland or Virginia, but Congress 
withdrew those voting rights 
once the District was founded. Unfortunately, 
apparently by omission, Congress 
neglected to establish new voting 
rights for the citizens of the new district. 


The right to be counted, to have your 
voice heard by your government is central 
to a functioning democracy and 
fundamental to a free society. If we are 
willing to sacrifice our young men and 
women in the name of freedom, we 
must be willing to protect their freedoms 
as well. This legislation would do 
just that. 

In 2002, 10 cosponsors and I introduced 
the No Taxation without Representation 
Act. I held a hearing on the 
bill in the Governmental Affairs Committee, 
which I then chaired. It was 
the first hearing in Congress on DC 
voting rights since 1994. We reported 
the bill out of committee, but the Senate 
never took action on it. 

Today, the tide has changed. Members 
from both parties have come together 
to find a solution to break the 
stalemates of the past that have denied 
DC residents equal representation in 
Congress. The State of Utah has united 
in favor of a fourth congressional seat, 
and Senator HATCH has lent his considerable 
support to this effort. Mr. President, 
this legislation represents an uncommon 
victory for fairness and a rare 
but hopefully increasingly more common 
example of what we can do if we 
work together to accomplish our mutual 
goals. 

The essence of our work in the legislative 
branch is compromise, and the 
compromise reached by Senator HATCH 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5395 

and I will bring partial voting representation 
to the District while ensuring 
Utah receives the additional representation 
it is due. 

I know there are those who believe 
this bill is unconstitutional. But the 
District clause of the Constitution, 
which gives Congress the power to legislate 
‘‘in all cases whatsoever’’ pertaining 
to the District, provides ample 
authority for the legislative branch to 
give DC residents voting rights. 

Mr. President, this is our moment to 
do right here at home, just as we have 
done throughout our history for our 
democratic allies abroad. By giving the 
citizens of the District of Columbia a 
vote in the House, we will ensure not 
only that their voices will finally be 
heard. We will be following the imperative 
of our history and moral values. 
The Framers of our Constitution in effect 
placed with Congress the solemn 
responsibility of assuring that the 
rights of DC citizens would be protected 
in the future, just as it is our responsibility 
to protect the rights of all 
citizens throughout this great country. 
Congress has failed to meet this obligation 
for more than 200 years, and I am 
not prepared to make DC citizens wait 
another 200 years. 

Mr. President, the tax-paying citizens 
of the District of Columbia have 
been without congressional voting representation 
for too long. The House has 
acted. Now it is time for the Senate to 
act. I urge my colleagues to join Senator 
HATCH and me in support of this 
essential legislation. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the text of the bill be printed 
in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 

S. 1257

of the United States of America in

Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join with Senate Committee 
on Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs Chairman JOSEPH 
LIEBERMAN and Senator ROBERT BENNETT 
in introducing the District of Columbia 
Voting House Rights Act of 

2007. Our colleagues in the House of 
Representatives recently passed similar 
legislation, H.R. 1905, that would 
provide a fourth congressional seat for 
my home state of Utah and the first 
voting member for the District of Columbia. 
No doubt, this is a historic 
time for the citizens of the District of 
Columbia and a unique opportunity for 
Utah to receive a long overdue fourth 
congressional seat. 

The Founding Fathers made clear in 
article 1, section 8 of the Constitution 
that the District of Columbia would be 
the seat of the national government 
and granted Congress the power ‘‘[t]o 
exercise exclusive Legislation, in all 
Cases whatsoever, over such District 
(not exceeding ten Miles square) as 
may, by Cession of particular States, 
and the Acceptance of Congress become 
the Seat of the Government of the 
United States . . .’’ This clause became 
effective in 1790 when Congress accepted 
land that Maryland and Virginia 
ceded to the United States to create 
the national capital. Ten years later, 
in December 1800, jurisdiction over the 
District of Columbia was vested in the 
Federal Government. Since then, District 
residents have not had the right 
to vote for Members of Congress. Additionally, 
article 1, section 2 and section 
3 of the Constitution provides that citizens 
of States shall have voting representation 
in the House and Senate. 

During my time in the Senate, I have 
heard from many District residents 
who believe strongly that their voice 
should be heard in Congress. They pay 
taxes, vote in presidential elections, 
and serve in the military. Yet these 
nearly 600,000 Americans do not have a 
voting representative in Congress. 
Many, including myself, have been reluctant 
to support previous proposals 
based upon the constitutional principle 
that States, not territories, are afforded 
congressional representation. I 
understand the argument that congressional 
representation is dependent on 
statehood and, therefore, the Constitution 
would need to be amended before 
the District is given a voting representative 
in Congress. While the Constitution 
does not affirmatively grant 
District residents the right to vote in 
congressional elections, it does affirmatively 
grant Congress plenary power 
to govern the District’s affairs. Indeed, 
the Constitution grants Congress exclusive 
authority to legislate all matters 
concerning the District, and I believe 
this authority extends to the 
granting of congressional voting rights 
for District residents. 

I support this legislation not only because 
it rectifies the District’s undemocratic 
political status, but it 
gives my home State of Utah a long 
overdue fourth voting Member in the 
House of Representatives. 

During the 2000 Census count, Utah 
missed out on a fourth House seat by 
only 857 people. The Census Bureau 
counted members of the military serving 
abroad as residents of their home 
State, but did not count an estimated 

14,000 Utah missionaries from the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints living abroad. Utah took its 
fight for a fourth seat all the way to 
the Supreme Court, but lost. Instead, 
North Carolina gained another seat in 
the House by 856 residents. Since then, 
I have heard from many Utahns and 
share their frustrations about the outcome 
of the 2000 Census. 

Why push for an additional seat now? 
Under normal circumstances, Utah 
would have to wait until the 2010 Census 
to see if its growing population justifies 
another congressional seat. However, 
the proposed legislation provides 
Utah a chance to receive another voting 
member of Congress 5 years early. 
That is equivalent to two and a half 
terms for a Member of Congress and 
places the new Member well on his or 
her way in establishing seniority and 
influence for the benefit of Utah’s citizens. 
I don’t think this is an offer we 
should dismiss. 

I have some constitutional concerns 
with H.R. 1905’s attempt to impose an 
at-large seat upon my State of Utah. In 
States with more than one seat in the 
House, Members are expected to represent 
insular constituencies. Under 

H.R. 1905, residents of one State would 
be represented by two House Members 
while citizens in other States would 
have one. In addition, in our constitutional 
system, States are responsible 
for elections and Utah has chosen the 
approach it wants to take by redistricting. 
I see no warrant for Congress 
to undermine this balance and impose 
upon Utah a scheme it has not chosen 
for itself. For this reason, in the proposed 
Senate legislation, I insisted 
that Utah be required to redistrict to 
provide for the new seat. I believe that 
Utah’s legislators deserve the freedom 
to determine their representatives’ districts 
without unjustified intrusion or 
mandate of the Federal Government. 
Additionally, the House bill would require 
Utah to hold a special election in 
2007 if the bill passes. The Senate 
version requires that both seats be 
elected in the November 2008 general 
election. Thereafter, both new Members 
would begin their service at the 
start of the 111th Congress in 2009. 

In conclusion, let me say that I recognize 
there are many who strongly oppose 
this legislation. There are many 
who wish the District voting rights 
issue would simply go away. The 
Democratic-controlled Congress could 
have simply pushed forward with legislation 
giving the District of Columbia 
a seat without balancing a ‘‘Democrat’’ 
seat with a ‘‘Republican’’ seat. I am 
pleased that this was not the case. The 
House of Representatives has already 
voted in favor of moving this legislation 
forward. Now it is up to the Senate. 
Let me be clear, the proposed legislation 
does not provide Senate representation 
for the District of Columbia. 
I am not in favor of granting two 
Senators for the District and would not 
support such a proposal. 

As one who represents Utah, I have 
an important responsibility to ensure 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5397 

that my State is dealt with properly 
and fairly. And, in light of the House’s 
recent legislative action, I am determined 
to do all that I can to ensure 
that Utah’s fourth seat configuration 
is done right. I want my fellow Utahns 
to know that the window of opportunity 
is quickly closing. In fact, I dare 
say there won’t be another opportunity 
like this again. For this reason, I intend 
to make the most of it and hope 
that my Senate colleagues will support 
me in this endeavor. 

By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself 
and Mr. SMITH): 

S. 1259. A bill to amend the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961 to provide assistance 
for developing countries to promote 
quality basic education and to establish 
the achievement of universal 
basic education in all developing countries 
as an objective of United States 
foreign assistance policy, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations. 
Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, 
I am proud to introduce, along with 
Senator GORDON SMITH, the Education 
for All Act of 2007. This bill would enable 
us to increase our spending on 
global education initiatives in order to 
help millions of children around the 
world have the opportunity to receive 
an education. 

Worldwide, more than 77 million children 
do not have access to primary 
school education. The majority of 
these—approximately 44 million—are 
girls. Approximately half of the school-
age children who start primary school 
do not complete it. And there are hundreds 
of millions more children who 
are denied the opportunity to complete 
a secondary school education—to become 
the next generation of doctors, 
nurses, lawyers, scientists, and teachers. 
These statistics represent a unconscionable 
misuse of human potential— 
a misuse that we can and must remedy. 

In 2000, the United States, along with 
other governments around the world, 
committed to the goal of achieving 
universal basic education by 2015. 
Through some of the initiatives and 
partnership in which our government is 
participating, such as the Education 
for All Fast Track Initiative, we have 
made progress. Since the Fast Track 
Initiative was launched in 2002, approximately 
4 million children each 
year have gained access to school. 

Yet despite such gains, we are not on 
track to meet our 2015 goal. In order to 
do so, we would need to help millions 
more children enter school each year— 
requiring a global financial commitment 
of more than $7 billion every 
year. 

The Education for All Act of 2007 
would authorize $10 billion in spending 
over the next 5 years, enabling the U.S. 
Government to make a significant 
commitment to reach the 2015 goal, 
and help children in developing countries, 
particularly areas experiencing 
conflict or humanitarian emergencies, 
have access to a quality basic edu


cation. The bill that I am introducing 
today will make a tangible difference 
in the lives of children around the 
world, by helping them to attend 
school and receive a quality education. 
And its impact will go far beyond the 
individual, but will also benefit families, 
communities, and countries. 

A 2004 report by Barbara Herz and 
Gene Sperling from the Center on Universal 
Education at the Council on 
Foreign Relations detailed the gains 
that are to be made when we invest in 
education, particularly for girls. A single 
year of primary education correlates 
with a 10–20 percent increase in 
women’s wages later in life. An extra 
year of a woman’s education has been 
shown to reduce the risk that her children 
will die in infancy by 5–10 percent, 
and a study of South Asia and Sub-Saharan 
Africa found that from 1960 to 
1992, equality in education between 
men and women could have led to nearly 
1 percent higher annual per capita 
GDP growth. 

We have the data to show that education 
is the path to good jobs, strong 
democracies, and stable societies. We 
have the capacity, responsibility, and 
opportunity to help millions of children 
worldwide. All it takes now is the 
will to expand access to educational 
opportunity. 

I believe with bipartisan support we 
can turn this bill into law, and lead the 
world in meeting the goal of universal 
basic education, and I look forward to 
working with my colleagues in Congress 
in making education for all a reality. 


Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Education for 
All Act of 2007 with my colleague from 
New York, Senator HILLARY CLINTON. 
This legislation will focus U.S. efforts 
to help provide all children worldwide 
with a basic education. At this time, at 
least 77 million children of primary 
school age around the world are not in 
school. 

Basic education is a critical part of a 
child’s development. In addition to providing 
children the tools necessary to 
succeed in life, education provides a 
secondary purpose of helping to reduce 
poverty and inequality. A strong basic 
education system also lays the foundation 
for sound governance, civic participation, 
and strong familial institutions. 
Without an education, children 
are less able to contribute to a country’s 
development, often becoming a 
burden on society. 

A recent Government Accountability 
Office concluded there are seven U.S. 
Federal agencies providing international 
basic education services in approximately 
70 countries. Unfortunately, 
the GAO also found instances 
when agencies did not coordinate the 
planning or delivery of international 
basic education activities. To maximize 
the impact of U.S. aid dollars, we 
must efficiently coordinate between 
government agencies to decrease redundant 
spending on overlapping programs. 
The Education for All Act will 
help achieve this. 

In 2000, at the World Education 
Forum in Dakar, Senegal, the United 
States was one of 180 countries to commit 
to the goal of universal basic education 
by 2015. Since then, we have enhanced 
our efforts to provide basic education 
overseas. From fiscal years 2001 
to 2006, USAID, the Departments of 
State and Defense and the Millennium 
Challenge Corporation allocated $2.2 
billion to support our basic international 
education efforts. During this 
same period, the Departments of Agriculture 
and Labor further allocated an 
estimated $1 billion to programs with 
basic education as a component. I am 
proud of our country’s generosity and 
commitment to this important goal. 

Our bill will ensure the United States 
provides the resources and leadership 
necessary to supply all children with a 
quality basic education. It calls on the 
President to establish a comprehensive 
strategy for achieving universal basic 
education by 2015. This strategy should 
include actions toward improving coordination, 
reducing duplication, expanding 
public-private partnerships, 
leveraging resources and maximizing 
the use of American technical experts. 
The bill also establishes a U.S. Education 
for All Coordinator, an ambassador-
level position appointed by the 
President and confirmed by the Senate. 
The Coordinator will manage U.S. efforts 
to ensure aid dollars are used in 
the most effective manner possible. 

The bill further establishes a fellowship 
program at USAID which allows 
qualified individuals to serve 3-year 
terms as Basic Education fellows, helping 
establish and carry out basic education 
policy and programming. This 
fellowship will broaden U.S. capabilities 
in the areas of technical assistance 
and training. Finally, the bill authorizes 
$1 billion for fiscal year 2008, $1.5 
billion for fiscal year 2009, $2 billion for 
fiscal year 2010, $2.5 billion for fiscal 
year 2011, and $3 billion for fiscal year 
2012 for international basic education 
programs. 

I hope my colleagues will join us in 
supporting the noble ambition of 
achieving universal basic education by 
endorsing the Education for All Act of 
2007. 

By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, 
Mr. HARKIN, and Mr. BROWN): 

S. 1261. A bill to amend title 10 and 
38, United States Code, to repeal the 
10–year limit on use of Montgomery GI 
Bill educational assistance benefits, 
and for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to speak about an investment 
program in lifelong education for 
our service members and veterans. The 
Montgomery GI Bill is consistently 
cited as an important reason people 
join the military and continues to be 
one of the most important benefits provided 
for military service today. There 
is no reason why 100 percent of our active 
duty, selected reserve, and veteran 
servicemembers should not have the 


S5398 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

opportunity to take advantage of their 
earned education benefits. 

That is why I’m reintroducing the 
Montgomery GI Bill for Life Act of 
2007, which would allow Montgomery 
GI Bill participants an unlimited 
amount of time to use their earned 
benefits. 

I am pleased that my colleague, Senator 
TOM HARKIN, is again joining me 
in sponsoring this legislation and that 
Senator SHERROD BROWN has also 
signed on to further extend MGIB benefits. 


The MGIB is a program that provides 
up to 36 months of education benefits 
for educational opportunities ranging 
from college to apprenticeship and job 
training, and even flight training. 
Upon enlistment, the GI Bill also requires 
service members to contribute 
$100 per month for their first 12 months 
of services. 

Basically, the MGIB is divided into 
two programs. One program targets active 
duty and veteran members, paying 
over $1,000 per month to qualified students. 
That’s more than $36,000 for 
school. The other is directed at the Selected 
Reserve. This program provides 
educational benefits of $288 per month, 
for a total of $10,368. 

If recruits are overwhelmingly declaring 
that education opportunity 
under the GI Bill is the key incentive 
for them to join the military, then it 
makes sense that most—if not all—of 
our troops, who signed up for the program, 
would also be cashing in on their 
benefits. But reports show that the majority, 
40 to 60 percent, do not actually 
use the benefits they have earned. 

Currently, MGIB participants have 
up to 10 years from their release date 
from the military to use their earned 
education benefits. Members of the Selected 
Reserve are able to use their 
MGIB benefit for 14 years. However, 
that means your earned education benefits 
expire if you don’t use the within 
the required timeframe, closing your 
window of opportunity to go to school 
or finish your college education. Plus, 
you lose the $1,200 dedicated for your 
GI Bill during your first year of enlistment. 


Originally, the intent of 1944 GI Bill 
of Rights was to help veterans successfully 
transition back into civilian life 
as education is the key to employment 
opportunities. Looking back now, we 
know that the GI Bill opened the door 
to higher education, helping millions 
of service members and veterans who 
wouldn’t otherwise have had the 
chance to pay for college. That is, 
servicemembers benefited from the GI 
Bill because they used the payments 
within the 10 and 14 year limitation. 

But there are many others who did 
not use their earned education benefits 
within that timeframe. For example, 
after leaving the military, some 
servicemembers postponed going to 
school because they had to go straight 
to work in order to support their family. 
Others unfortunately, were either 
homeless or incarcerated for long peri


ods of time due to disability associated 
with military service, but are now 
ready to move forward in their lives, 
and going back to school is their first 
step. In some cases, due to random life 
circumstances, some people just lost 
track of time. Additionally, because of 
misinformation and bureaucratic language, 
the GI Bill is known as a complicated 
program to navigate. 

A constituent of mine, Ruben 
Ruelas—who is a Local Veterans Employment 
Representative, LVER, for 
the WorkSource in Wenatchee, Washington, 
wrote to me saying, ‘‘It’s been 
my experience that most people don’t 
know what they want to do in life or 
are placed in situations where, due to 
changing economic times, they are displaced 
and need further education and 
training to compete for jobs. But most 
don’t have access to training resources 
to do so.’’ 

In terms of Vietnam Era veterans, 
Mr. Ruelas goes on to say, ‘‘many 50 
year olds are unemployed, untrained 
and uneducated and could use their 
educational benefits to improve their 
skills to compete for better jobs. Many 
have come to realize, too late, that 
they need college or retraining and 
don’t have the resources to do so.’’ 

While times have changed remarkably, 
one thing remains constant: education 
is critical to employment opportunity. 
In the 21st Century global labor 
market, enhancing skills through education 
and job training is now more 
important than ever. The need for retraining 
is even more underscored for 
our military service members and veterans. 


My legislation, the Montgomery GI 
Bill for Life, would ensure that educational 
opportunities are lifelong, allowing 
service members and veterans 
the flexibility to seek education and 
job training opportunities when it is 
the right time for them to do so. 

Higher education not only serves as 
an individual benefit, but positive 
externalities have transpired: the GI 
Bill was instrumental in building our 
country’s middle class and continues to 
help close the college education gap. 

Today, employers are requiring higher 
qualifications from the workforce. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports 
that six of the ten fastest-growing occupations 
require an associate’s degree 
or bachelor’s degree. By 2010, 40 percent 
of all job growth will require some 
form of postsecondary education. While 
a highly skilled workforce is one characteristic 
of the new economy, working 
for one employer throughout a lifetime 
is no longer routine, but rather an evanescent 
feature. According to findings 
by Brigham Young University, the average 
person changes jobs or careers 
eight times in his or her lifetime. To 
keep up with these trends, expanding 
access to education and training is a 
must do in the 21st Century global 
marketplace. 

A 1999 report by the Congressional 
Commission on Service members and 
Veterans Transition Assistance stated 

that the GI Bill of the future must include 
the following: Provide veterans 
with access to post-secondary education 
that they use; assist the Armed 
forces in recruiting the high quality 
high school graduates needed; enhance 
the Nation’s competitiveness by further 
educating American veterans, a 
population that is already self-disciplined, 
goal oriented, and steadfast; 
and attract the kind of service members 
who will go on to occupy leadership 
positions in government and the 
private sector. 

Eliminating the GI Bill 10 and 14 year 
limitation for service members, veterans, 
and Selected Reserve moves one 
step toward improving the MGIB. The 
Montgomery GI Bill for Life would 
allow MGIB members, including qualified 
Vietnam Era Veterans, the flexibility 
to access their earned education 
benefits at any time. 

As the nation’s economy continues to 
recover and grow stronger, the GI Bill 
will continue to be the primary vehicle 
keeping our active duty service members 
and veterans of military service 
on track, helping to ensure our country’s 
prosperity.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 

SENATE RESOLUTION 178—EXPRESSING 
THE SYMPATHY OF 
THE SENATE TO THE FAMILIES 
OF WOMEN AND GIRLS MURDERED 
IN GUATEMALA, AND ENCOURAGING 
THE UNITED STATES 
TO WORK WITH GUATEMALA TO 
BRING AN END TO THESE 
CRIMES 

Mr. BINGAMAN submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Relations: 


S. RES. 178 
Whereas, since 2001, more than 2,000 women 
and girls have been murdered in Guatemala; 
Whereas most of the victims are women 
ranging in age from 18 to 30, with many of 
the cases involving abduction, sexual violence, 
or brutal mutilation; 
Whereas, from 2001 to 2006, the rate at 
which women have been murdered in Guatemala 
has almost doubled, increasing at a 
higher rate than the murder rate of men in 
Guatemala during the same period; 
Whereas, according to data from Guatemala’s 
Public Prosecutors Office, few arrests 
and fewer convictions have occurred, and 
prosecutors, forensics experts, and other 
state justice officials have not brought the 
perpetrators to justice; 
Whereas, from 2001 to 2006, there were only 
20 convictions for the murders of women and 
girls; 
Whereas the Human Rights Ombudsman of 
the Government of Guatemala has reported 
that in 1 year alone police officers were implicated 
on 10 separate occasions in the murder 
of women in Guatemala, and recommended 
that such officers and other officials 
be held accountable for their acts; 
Whereas an effective, transparent, and impartial 
judicial system is key to the administration 
of justice, and the failure to ensure 
proper investigations and prosecutions hampers 
the ability to solve crimes and punish 
perpetrators; 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5399 

Whereas inadequate financial, human, and 
technical resources, as well as a lack of forensic 
and technical expertise, have impeded 
the arrest and prosecution of suspects; 

Whereas the Special Prosecutor for Crimes 
Against Women of the Government of Guatemala 
has reported that her office has reviewed 
approximately 800 incidents of domestic 
violence per month, with some of 
those cases ending in murder, and that 
deaths could have been prevented if the legal 
system of Guatemala provided for prison sentences 
in cases of domestic violence; 

Whereas the murders of women and girls in 
Guatemala have brought pain to the families 
and friends of the victims as they struggle to 
cope with the loss of their loved ones and the 
fact that the perpetrators of these heinous 
acts remain unknown to the proper authorities; 


Whereas many countries in Latin America 
face significant challenges in combating violence 
against women, and international cooperation 
is essential in addressing this serious 
issue; 

Whereas the United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID) has provided 
assistance to the Government of Guatemala 
to implement judicial reform and 
rule of law programs, and in fiscal year 2006, 
Congress provided $1,500,000 for programs to 
combat impunity, corruption, and crimes of 
violence, of which $500,000 is to be allocated 
to strengthen the special prosecutorial units 
charged with investigating the murders of 
women in Guatemala; 

Whereas the Government of Guatemala has 
undertaken efforts to prevent violence 
against women, as evidenced by its ratification 
of the United Nations Convention 
Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 
done at New York December 10, 1984, the 
United Nations Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination 
Against Women, done at New York December 
18, 1979, the Inter-American Convention on 
the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication 
of Violence Against Women, done at 
Belem do Para, Brazil June 9, 1994, and other 
international human rights treaties, and the 
enactment of laws and the creation of state 
institutions to promote and protect the 
rights of women; 

Whereas the Government of Guatemala has 
created special police and prosecutorial 
units to address the brutal murders of 
women in Guatemala; 

Whereas, in June 2006, the Government of 
Guatemala successfully abolished the ‘‘Rape 
Law’’ which had absolved perpetrators of 
criminal responsibility for rape and certain 
other crimes of violence upon the perpetrator’s 
marriage with the victim; 

Whereas legislators from various parties in 
Guatemala have joined lawmakers from 
Mexico and Spain to form the ‘‘Interparliamentary 
Network against ‘Femicide’’’; 

Whereas the Government of Guatemala 
and the United Nations recently entered into 
an agreement to establish the International 
Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala 
(CICIG), which has a mandate to investigate 
and promote the prosecution of illegal security 
groups and clandestine security organizations 
that function with impunity and are 
suspected of attacking human rights defenders, 
justice officials, and other civil society 
actors; and 

Whereas continuing impunity for crimes 
against women is a threat to the rule of law, 
democracy, and stability in Guatemala: Now, 
therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) expresses its sincerest condolences and 
deepest sympathy to the families of women 
and girls murdered in Guatemala, and recognizes 
their courageous struggle in seeking 
justice for the victims; 

(2) expresses the solidarity of the people of 
the United States with the people of Guatemala 
in the face of these tragic and senseless 
acts; 
(3) condemns the ongoing murders of 
women and girls in Guatemala, and encourages 
the Government of Guatemala to act 
with due diligence in order to promptly investigate 
these killings, prosecute those responsible, 
and continue to work toward 
eliminating violence against women; 
(4) urges the Government of Guatemala to 
recognize domestic violence and sexual harassment 
as criminal acts and to provide the 
resources and commitment necessary to 
strengthen the integrity of the prosecutorial 
and judicial systems; 
(5) urges the President and the Secretary 
of State to incorporate the investigative and 
preventative efforts of the Government of 
Guatemala regarding the murder of women 
and girls into the bilateral agenda between 
the Governments of Guatemala and the 
United States; 
(6) encourages the Secretary of State to 
support efforts by the Government of Guatemala 
to train and equip the special police 
and prosecutorial units of the Government of 
Guatemala to conduct thorough and proper 
investigations of crimes of violence against 
women, and to implement judicial reform 
and rule of law programs; 
(7) encourages the Secretary of State and 
the Attorney General to provide assistance 
in establishing a comprehensive missing persons 
system and an effective state protection 
program for witnesses, victims’ relatives, 
and human rights defenders; 
(8) urges the Government of Guatemala to 
hold accountable those law enforcement and 
judicial officials whose failure to investigate 
and prosecute the murders adequately, 
whether through negligence, omission, or 
abuse, has led to impunity for these crimes; 
(9) encourages the Secretary of State to 
support efforts to identify perpetrators and 
unknown victims through forensic analysis, 
including assisting the Government of Guatemala 
in adequately funding the National 
Institute for Forensic Science (INACIF) and 
training lab personnel in investigatory and 
evidence gathering protocols; 
(10) urges the Secretary of State— 
(A) to express support for the efforts of the 
victims’ families and loved ones to seek justice 
for the victims, 
(B) to express concern relating to any harassment 
of these families and the human 
rights defenders with whom they work, and 
(C) to express concern with respect to impediments 
in the ability of the families to 
receive prompt and accurate information in 
their cases; 
(11) encourages the Secretary of State to 
continue to include in the Department of 
State’s annual Country Reports on Human 
Rights Practices all instances of improper 
investigatory methods, threats against 
human rights activists, and the use of torture 
with respect to cases involving the murder 
and abduction of women and girls in 
Guatemala; 
(12) recommends that the United States 
Ambassador to Guatemala continue to meet 
with the families of the victims, women’s 
rights organizations, and the officials of the 
Government of Guatemala who are responsible 
for investigating these crimes; and 
(13) recommends that the Secretary of 
State develop a comprehensive plan to address 
and combat the growing problem of violence 
against women in Latin America. 
Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak about the tragic deaths 
of women and girls in Guatemala, and 

to submit a resolution urging increased 

U.S. involvement in addressing this serious 
issue. 
Since 2001, more than 2,000 women 
and girls have been murdered in Guatemala. 
The murder rate of these women 
almost doubled from 2001 to 2006, increasing 
at a higher rate than the murder 
rate of men. While these killings 
may be due to a variety of factors, 
what clearly unifies these cases is the 
fact that very few of the perpetrators 
have been brought to justice. Indeed, it 
is my understanding that as of 2006 
there have been only 20 convictions for 
these killings. In some of the cases police 
have been implicated in the 
crimes. 

The lack of respect for the rule of 
law, inadequate legal protections for 
women, ongoing violence in the country, 
corruption, insufficient resources, 
substandard investigations, and the 
lack of independent and effective judicial 
and prosecutorial systems, all contribute 
to the inability of the Government 
of Guatemala to hold those responsible 
for these killings accountable 
for their crimes. The result is a general 
sense of impunity for crimes against 
women in the country. 

The Government of Guatemala has 
taken some steps to address these 
killings. Guatemala has created special 
police and prosecutorial units to investigate 
these murders, and repealed the 
so called ‘‘Rape Law’’ which had absolved 
perpetrators of criminal responsibility 
for rape upon the perpetrator’s 
marriage with the victim. The Government 
also recently entered into an 
agreement with the United Nations to 
establish the International Commission 
Against Impunity in Guatemala, 
CICIG, which has a mandate to investigate 
and prosecute illegal security 
groups operating with impunity. And 
Guatemala established the National Institute 
for Forensic Sciences to improve 
investigatory and evidence gathering 
efforts. 

The resolution I am submitting 
today is aimed at raising awareness of 
this issue and encouraging the governments 
of Guatemala and the United 
States to work together to stop these 
killings. Among other things, the resolution: 
condemns these murders and 
expresses the sympathy of the Senate 
to the families of women and girls murdered 
in Guatemala; encourages the 
Government of Guatemala to act with 
due diligence in investigating and prosecuting 
those responsible for these 
crimes; urges the Government of Guatemala 
to recognize domestic violence 
as a criminal act and to provide adequate 
resources necessary to strengthen 
the integrity of the prosecutorial 
and judicial systems; urges the President 
and the Secretary of State to incorporate 
this issue into the bilateral 
agenda between the governments of 
Guatemala and the United States; and 
encourages the Secretary of State to 
provide assistance in training and

equipping special police units to investigate 
these crimes, implementing judicial 
reforms and rule of law programs, 
establishing a missing persons 
system, creating an effective witness 
protection program, and supporting efforts 
to enhance forensic capabilities. 

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues 
to support this important resolution 
and give this issue the attention it deserves.

Whereas Singapore selected the F–15SG

Whereas Singapore is the 15th largest trading

Asia-Pacific region, and the United States is 
the second largest trading partner of Singapore; 


Whereas the relationship between the

is reinforced by strong ties of culture, commerce, 
and scientific and technical cooperation; 
and 

Whereas the relationship between the 
United States and Singapore encompasses almost 
every field of international cooperation, 
including a common commitment to 
fostering a stronger and more open international 
trading system: Now, therefore, be 
it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) welcomes the Prime Minister of Singapore, 
His Excellency Lee Hsien Loong, to the 
United States; 
(2) congratulates the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN), and Singapore 
as one of its founding members, on the 40th 
anniversary of ASEAN; 
(3) expresses profound gratitude to the 
Government of Singapore for promoting security 
and prosperity in Southeast Asia and 
cooperating with the United States in the 
global campaign against terrorism; and 
(4) reaffirms the commitment of the 
United States to continue strengthening the 
friendship and cooperation between the 
United States, Singapore, and the other 
countries of the ASEAN region.

AND DESIGNATING MAY

Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mr. 
CRAIG) submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on the Judiciary: 

S. RES. 180 
Whereas the State of Idaho produces 
roughly one-third of all the potatoes grown 
in the United States, harvesting an average 
of 12,000,000,000 to 14,000,000,000 pounds annually; 
Whereas the State of Idaho’s unique climate 
of warm days, cool nights, mountain-

States due to their consistently great taste, 
versatility, and nutritional content;

throughout the world for its high 
quality and is an identifying characteristic

Idaho potato industry group responsible for 
generating attention for the numerous attributes 
of Idaho potatoes; 
Whereas the Idaho Potato Commission is 
recognized nationally and internationally as 
a top promotional authority for Idaho’s potatoes 
and potato products; 
Whereas the Idaho Potato Commission’s 
requirement, since 1959, that only potatoes 
grown in the State of Idaho are allowed to 
wear the ‘‘Grown in Idaho’’ Federal certification 
mark contributed toward the creation 
of a distinctive, enduringly successful, and 

popular brand for the Russet Burbank potato 
variety; and 

Whereas Idaho’s potato industry contributes 
approximately $2,700,000,000 to the State 
economy and employs 39,000 residents: Now, 
therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) recognizes the 70th anniversary of the

Whereas charter schools deliver high-quality 
education and challenge students to 
reach their potential; 
Whereas charter schools provide thousands 
of families with diverse and innovative educational 
options for their children; 
Whereas charter schools are public schools 
authorized by designated public entities to 
respond to the needs of communities, families, 
and students, and to promote the principles 
of quality, choice, and innovation; 
Whereas, in exchange for the flexibility 
and autonomy given to charter schools,

and for their finances and other operations;

have passed laws authorizing charter 
schools; 
Whereas more than 4,000 charter schools

public schools, and often set higher 
and additional individual goals to ensure

truly accountable to the public; 
Whereas charter schools give parents new 
freedom to choose public schools, routinely 
measure parental satisfaction levels, and 
must prove their ongoing success to parents,

the United States.

CHILDHOOD STROKE AND DESIG


NATING MAY 5, 2007, AS ‘‘NATIONAL 
CHILDHOOD STROKE 
AWARENESS DAY’’ 

Mr. CHAMBLISS (for himself and Mr. 
CASEY) submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed 
to: 

S. RES. 184 
Whereas a stroke, also known as a ‘‘cerebrovascular 
accident’’, is an acute neurologic 
injury that occurs when the blood supply to 
a part of the brain is interrupted by a clot in 
the artery or a burst of the artery; 
Whereas a stroke is a medical emergency 
that can cause permanent neurologic damage 
or even death if not promptly diagnosed and 
treated; 
Whereas 26 out of every 100,000 newborns 
and almost 3 out of every 100,000 children

stroke will suffer serious, long-term neurological 
disabilities, including— 

(1) hemiplegia, which is paralysis of 1 side 
of the body; 
(2) seizures; 
(3) speech and vision problems; and 

S5402 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

(4) learning difficulties; 
Whereas those disabilities may require ongoing 
physical therapy and surgeries; 
Whereas the permanent health concerns 
and treatments resulting from strokes that 
occur during childhood and young adulthood 
have a considerable impact on children, families, 
and society; 

Whereas very little is known about the 
cause, treatment, and prevention of childhood 
stroke; 

Whereas medical research is the only 
means by which the citizens of the United 
States can identify and develop effective 
treatment and prevention strategies for 
childhood stroke; 

Whereas early diagnosis and treatment of 
childhood stroke greatly improves the 
chances that the affected child will recover 
and not experience a recurrence; and 

Whereas the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia 
should be commended for its initiative 
in creating the Nation’s first program 
dedicated to pediatric stroke patients: Now, 
therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) designates May 5, 2007 as ‘‘National 
Childhood Stroke Awareness Day’’; and 
(2) urges the people of the United States to 
support the efforts, programs, services, and

(C) verifying shipment or receipt of prescription 
drugs; 
(D) authenticating finished prescription 
drugs; and

or transmitting any advertisement or information 
about prescription drug indications 
or off-label prescription drug uses. 
(c) RECOMMENDED TECHNOLOGIES.—The Secretary 
shall encourage the manufacturers 
and distributors of prescription drugs to incorporate 
into the packaging of such drugs, 
in addition to the technologies required 
under subsection (a), overt optically variable 
counterfeit-resistant technologies that— 
(1) are visible to the naked eye, providing 
for visual identification of prescription drug 
authenticity without the need for readers, 
microscopes, lighting devices, or scanners;

able to determine the authenticity of the 
shipment. Chain of custody procedures shall 
apply to such labels and shall include procedures 
applicable to contractual agreements 
for the use and distribution of the labels, 
methods to audit the use of the labels, and 
database access for the relevant governmental 
agencies for audit or verification of 
the use and distribution of the labels. 
(e) PENALTY.—A prescription drug is 
deemed to be misbranded for purposes of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21

TITLE—IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION 
DRUGS 
SEC. l01. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Pharmaceutical 
Market Access Act of 2007’’. 
SEC. l02. FINDINGS. 

Congress finds as follows: 

(1) Americans unjustly pay up to 1,000 percent 
more to fill their prescriptions than 
consumers in other countries. 
(2) The United States is the world’s largest 
market for pharmaceuticals yet consumers 
still pay the world’s highest prices. 
(3) An unaffordable drug is neither safe nor 
effective. Allowing and structuring the importation 
of prescription drugs ensures access 
to affordable drugs, thus providing a 
level of safety to American consumers they 
do not currently enjoy. 
(4) Prescription drug costs are a leading 
cause of the growth in United States health 
care spending, which reached nearly 
$2,000,000,0000 in 2005, of which spending on 
prescription drugs amounted to 
$200,700,000,000. 

(5) According to the Congressional Budget 
Office, American seniors alone will spend 
$1,800,000,000,000 on pharmaceuticals over the 
next 10 years. 
(6) Allowing open pharmaceutical markets 
could save American consumers at least 
$635,000,000,000 of their own money. 
SEC. l03. PURPOSES. 

The purposes of this title are to— 

(1) give all Americans immediate relief 
from the outrageously high cost of pharmaceuticals; 
(2) reverse the perverse economics of the 
American pharmaceutical market; 
(3) allow the importation of prescription 
drugs only if the drugs and facilities where 
such drugs are manufactured are approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration, and to 
exclude pharmaceutical narcotics; 
(4) ensure continued integrity to the prescription 
drug supply of the United States 
by— 
(A) requiring that imported prescription 
drugs be packaged and shipped using counterfeit-
resistant technologies; 
(B) requiring Internet pharmacies to register 
with the United States Government for 
Americans to verify authenticity before purchases 
over the Internet; 
(C) requiring all foreign sellers to register 
with United States Government and submit 
to facility inspections by the Government 
without prior notice; and 
(D) limiting the eligible countries from 
which prescription drugs may be imported to 
Canada, member countries of the European 
Union, and other highly industrialized nations 
with safe pharmaceutical infrastructures.

into the United States under this section; 

‘‘(B) discriminate by charging a higher 
price for a prescription drug sold to a person

this section, or that does not distribute, sell, 
or use such a drug; 

‘‘(C) discriminate by denying supplies of a

that manufactures a prescription drug that 
may be imported or offered for import under

that fails to provide for compliance with all 
requirements of this section with respect to 
such prescription drug or that has the effect 
of prohibiting importation of the drug under

‘‘(J) engage in any other action that the 
Federal Trade Commission determines to 
discriminate against a person that engages 
in, or to impede, delay, or block the process 
for, the importation of a prescription drug

‘‘(2) AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.—It shall be an 
affirmative defense to a charge that a person 
has discriminated under subparagraph (A), 
(B), (C), (D), or (E) of paragraph (1) that the 
higher price charged for a prescription drug 
sold to a person, the denial of supplies of a 
prescription drug to a person, the refusal to 
do business with a person, or the specific restriction

manufacturing establishment, 
manufacturing process, or person that manufactures 
the drug) created after January 1, 
2007, between a prescription drug for distribution 
in the United States and the drug 
for distribution in a permitted country shall 
be presumed under paragraph (1)(H) to be for 
the purpose of restricting importation of the 
drug into the United States under this section. 


‘‘(B) AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.—It shall be an 
affirmative defense to the presumption 
under subparagraph (A) that— 

‘‘(i) the difference was required by the 
country in which the drug is distributed; or

the manufacturer of a drug to distribute 
or sell the drug in a country. 

‘‘(B) DISCOUNTS TO INSURERS, HEALTH 
PLANS, PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS, AND 
COVERED ENTITIES.—Nothing in this subsection 
shall be construed to—

same manner, by the same means, and with 
the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as 
though all applicable terms and provisions of 
the Federal Trade Commission Act were incorporated

in the aggregate by statistical or sampling 
methods, by the computation of illegal 
overcharges or by such other reasonable system 
of estimating aggregate damages as the

by—

of a registration submitted under 
subsection (f) by a registered exporter: 

‘‘(i) Subject to clause (ii), if the Secretary 
determines, after notice and opportunity for 
a hearing, that the registered exporter has 
failed to maintain substantial compliance 
with all registration conditions, the Secretary 
may suspend the registration. 

‘‘(ii) If the Secretary determines that, 
under color of the registration, the registered 
exporter has exported a drug that is 
not a qualifying drug, or a drug that does not

in violation of this section, the Secretary 
shall immediately suspend the registration.

to the registered exporter involved an 
opportunity for a hearing not later than 10 
days after the date on which the registration

or (ii), if the Secretary determines that the 
registered exporter has demonstrated that 
further violations of registration conditions 
will not occur. 

‘‘(B) TERMINATION.—The Secretary, after 
notice and opportunity for a hearing, may 
terminate the registration under subsection 

(f) of a registered exporter if the Secretary 
determines that the registered exporter has 
engaged in a pattern or practice of violating 
1 or more registration conditions, or if on 1 
or more occasions the Secretary has under 
subparagraph (A)(ii) suspended the registration 
of the registered exporter. The Secretary 
may make the termination permanent, 
or for a fixed period of not less than 1 
year. During the period in which the registration 
of a registered exporter is terminated, 
any registration submitted under subsection 
(f) by such exporter or a person who 
is a partner in the export enterprise or a 
principal officer in such enterprise, and any 
registration prepared with the assistance of 
such exporter or such a person, has no legal 
effect under this section.’’.

TITLE—DOMESTIC PET TURTLE MARKET 
ACCESS 
SEC. ll. SHORT TITLE. 

This title may be cited as the ‘‘Domestic 
Pet Turtle Market Access Act of 2007’’. 
SEC. ll. FINDINGS. 

Congress makes the following findings: 

(1) Pet turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in 
diameter have been banned for sale in the 
United States by the Food and Drug Administration 
since 1975 due to health concerns. 
(2) The Food and Drug Administration does 
not ban the sale of iguanas or other lizards, 
snakes, frogs, or other amphibians or reptiles 
that are sold as pets in the United 
States that also carry salmonella bacteria. 
The Food and Drug Administration also does 
not require that these animals be treated for 
salmonella bacteria before being sold as pets. 
(3) The technology to treat turtles for salmonella, 
and make them safe for sale, has 
greatly advanced since 1975. Treatments 
exist that can nearly eradicate salmonella 
from turtles, and individuals are more aware 
of the causes of salmonella, how to treat salmonella 
poisoning, and the seriousness associated 
with salmonella poisoning. 
(4) University research has shown that 
these turtles can be treated in such a way 
that they can be raised, shipped, and distributed 
without having a recolonization of salmonella. 
(5) University research has also shown that 
pet owners can be equipped with a treatment 
regiment that allows the turtle to be maintained 
safe from salmonella. 
(6) The Food and Drug Administration 
should allow the sale of turtles less than 10.2 
centimeters in diameter as pets as long as 
the sellers are required to use proven methods 
to treat the turtles for salmonella and 
maintain a safe pet. 

SEC. ll. SALE OF BABY TURTLES. 

(a) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, the Food and Drug 
Administration shall not restrict the sale by 
a turtle farmer or other commercial retail 
seller of a turtle that is less than 10.2 centimeters 
in diameter as a pet if— 
(1) the turtle is raised, shipped, and sold 
using methods that are proven to keep the 
turtle free of salmonella, using salmonella 
safety standards that are comparable to such 
standards relating to other animals, including 
reptiles and amphibians, that are allowed 
for sale as pets, or animal products that are 
allowed for sale as food products; 
(2) the Administration has approved a plan 
submitted by the turtle farmer or commercial 
retail seller involved relating to compliance 
with paragraph (1); and 
(3) the farmer or other commercial retail 
seller includes, with the sale of such a turtle, 
a disclosure to the buyer that includes— 
(A) information regarding— 
(i) the dangers, including possible severe 
illness or death, especially for at-risk people 
who may be susceptible to salmonella poisoning, 
such as children, pregnant women, 
and others who may have weak immune systems, 
that could result if the turtle is not 
properly handled and safely maintained; 
(ii) the proper handling of the turtle, including 
an explanation of proper hygiene 
such as handwashing after handling a turtle; 
and 
(iii) the proven methods of treatment that, 
if properly applied, keep the turtle safe from 
salmonella; 
(B) a detailed explanation of how to properly 
treat the turtle to keep it safe from salmonella, 
using the proven methods of treatment 
referred to under subparagraph (A), 
and how the buyer can continue to purchase 
the tools, treatments, or any other required 
item to continually treat the turtle; and 
(C) a statement that buyers of pet turtles 
should not abandon the turtle or abandon it 
outside, as the turtle may become an 
invasive species to the local community, but 
should instead return them to a commercial 
retail pet seller or other organization that 
would accept turtles no longer wanted as 
pets. 
(b) PLAN.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—A turtle farmer or other 
commercial seller that desires to sell a turtle 
as provided for under subsection (a) shall 
submit a plan to the Food and Drug Administration 
that details the manner in which 
the farmer or seller will ensure compliance 
with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) 
with respect to the turtles involved. The 
plan shall include use of non-antibiotic compounds 
that suppress or eliminate the presence 
of salmonella in turtle hatchlings. 
(2) ACTION BY FDA.—Not later 30 days after 
the date on which the Food and Drug Administration 
receives a plan under paragraph (1), 
the Administration shall accept or reject 
such plan. If such plan is rejected, the Administration 
shall provide clear, specific 
guidance on the reasons for such rejection. 
The Administration may only reject such a 
plan if it is determined that the plan fails to 
achieve the same salmonella safety standards 
as such standards relating to other animals, 
including reptiles and amphibians, 
that are allowed for sale as pets, or animal 
products that are allowed for sale as food 
products. 
(c) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
this section shall be construed to permit the 
Food and Drug Administration to hold the 
sale of turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in 

S5408 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

diameter as a pet to any greater salmonella 
safety standard applicable to other reptiles

TITLE ll—IMPORTATION OF 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
SEC. l01. SHORT TITLE. 

This title may be cited as the ‘‘Pharmaceutical 
Market Access and Drug Safety Act 
of 2007’’. 
SEC. l02. FINDINGS. 

Congress finds that— 

(1) Americans unjustly pay up to 5 times 
more to fill their prescriptions than consumers 
in other countries; 
(2) the United States is the largest market 
for pharmaceuticals in the world, yet American 
consumers pay the highest prices for 
brand pharmaceuticals in the world; 
(3) a prescription drug is neither safe nor 
effective to an individual who cannot afford 
it; 
(4) allowing and structuring the importation 
of prescription drugs to ensure access to 
safe and affordable drugs approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration will provide a 
level of safety to American consumers that 
they do not currently enjoy; 
(5) American spend more than 
$200,000,000,000 on prescription drugs every 
year; 
(6) the Congressional Budget Office has 
found that the cost of prescription drugs are 
between 35 to 55 percent less in other highly-
developed countries than in the United 
States; and 
(7) promoting competitive market pricing 
would both contribute to health care savings 
and allow greater access to therapy, improving 
health and saving lives.

TITLEllPRESERVE ACCESS TO 
AFFORDABLE GENERICS ACT 

SEC. l01. SHORT TITLE. 

This title may be cited as the ‘‘Preserve 
Access to Affordable Generics Act’’. 

SEC. l02. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION 
OF PURPOSES. 

(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that— 
(1) prescription drugs make up 11 percent 
of the national health care spending but are 
1 of the largest and fastest growing health 
care expenditures; 
(2) 56 percent of all prescriptions dispensed 
in the United States are generic drugs, yet 
they account for only 13percent of all expenditures; 
(3) generic drugs, on average, cost 63 percent 
less than their brand-name counterparts; 
(4) consumers and the health care system 
would benefit from free and open competition 
in the pharmaceutical market and the 
removal of obstacles to the introduction of 
generic drugs; 

S5422 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

(5) full and free competition in the pharmaceutical 
industry, and the full enforcement 
of antitrust law to prevent anticompetitive 
practices in this industry, will 
lead to lower prices, greater innovation, and 
inure to the general benefit of consumers. 
(6) the Federal Trade Commission has determined 
that some brand name pharmaceutical 
manufacturers collude with generic 
drug manufacturers to delay the marketing 
of competing, low-cost, generic drugs; 
(7) collusion by the brand name pharmaceutical 
manufacturers is contrary to free 
competition, to the interests of consumers, 
and to the principles underlying antitrust 
law; 
(8) in 2005, 2 appellate court decisions reversed 
the Federal Trade Commission’s long-
standing position, and upheld settlements 
that include pay-offs by brand name pharmaceutical 
manufacturers to generic manufacturers 
designed to keep generic competition 
off the market; 
(9) in the 6 months following the March 
2005 court decisions, the Federal Trade Commission 
found there were three settlement 
agreements in which the generic received 
compensation and agreed to a restriction on 
its ability to market the product; 
(10) the FTC found that more than 2/3 of the 
approximately ten settlement agreements 
made in 2006 include a pay-off from the brand 
in exchange for a promise by the generic 
company to delay entry into the market; and 
(11) settlements which include a payment 
from a brand name manufacturer to a generic 
manufacturer to delay entry by generic 
drugs are anti-competitive and contrary to 
the interests of consumers. 
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this title 
are— 
(1) to enhance competition in the pharmaceutical 
market by prohibiting anticompetitive 
agreements and collusion between brand 
name and generic drug manufacturers intended 
to keep generic drugs off the market; 
(2) to support the purpose and intent of 
antitrust law by prohibiting anticompetitive 
agreements and collusion in the pharmaceutical 
industry; and 
(3) to clarify the law to prohibit payments 
from brand name to generic drug manufacturers 
with the purpose to prevent or delay 
the entry of competition from generic drugs.

filer, whether or not included in a complaint 
filed with a court of law, that its ANDA or

may, by rule promulgated under section 
553 of title 5, United States Code, exempt 
certain agreements described in the 
section 29 of the Clayton Act, as added by 
subsection (a), if the Commission finds such

TITLEllDOMESTIC PET TURTLE 
MARKET ACCESS 

SEC. ll. SHORT TITLE. 

This title may be cited as the ‘‘Domestic 
Pet Turtle Market Access Act of 2007’’. 

SEC. ll. FINDINGS. 

Congress makes the following findings: 

(1) Pet turtles less than 10.2 centimeters in 
diameter have been banned for sale in the 
United States by the Food and Drug Administration 
since 1975 due to health concerns. 
(2) The Food and Drug Administration does 
not ban the sale of iguanas or other lizards, 
snakes, frogs, or other amphibians or reptiles 
that are sold as pets in the United 
States that also carry salmonella bacteria. 
The Food and Drug Administration also does 
not require that these animals be treated for 
salmonella bacteria before being sold as pets. 
(3) The technology to treat turtles for salmonella, 
and make them safe for sale, has 
greatly advanced since 1975. Treatments 
exist that can nearly eradicate salmonella 
from turtles, and individuals are more aware 
of the causes of salmonella, how to treat salmonella 
poisoning, and the seriousness associated 
with salmonella poisoning. 
(4) University research has shown that 
these turtles can be treated in such a way 
that they can be raised, shipped, and distributed 
without having a recolonization of salmonella. 
(5) University research has also shown that 
pet owners can be equipped with a treatment 
regiment that allows the turtle to be maintained 
safe from salmonella. 
(6) The Food and Drug Administration 
should allow the sale of turtles less than 10.2 
centimeters in diameter as pets as long as 
the sellers are required to use proven methods 
to treat these turtles for salmonella. 
SEC. ll. SALE OF BABY TURTLES. 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, the Food and Drug Administration shall 
not restrict the sale by a turtle farmer, 
wholesaler or commercial retail seller of a 
turtle that is less than 10.2 centimeters in diameter 
as a pet if— 
(1) the State or territory in which such 
farmer is located has developed a regulatory 
process by which pet turtle farmers are required 
to have a State license to breed, 
hatch, propagate, raise, grow, receive, ship, 
transport, export, or sell pet turtles or pet 
turtle eggs; 

May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5431 

(2) such State or territory requires certification 
of sanitization that is signed by a veterinarian 
who is licensed in the State or territory, 
and approved by the State or territory 
agency in charge of regulating the sale 
of pet turtles; 
(3) the certification of sanitization requires 
each turtle to be sanitized or treated 
for diseases, including salmonella, and is dependant 
upon using the Siebeling method, or 
other such proven method, which uses an antibiotic 
to make the turtle salmonella-free; 
and 
(4) the turtle farmer or commercial retail 
seller includes, with the sale of such a turtle, 
a disclosure to the buyer that includes— 
(A) information regarding— 
(i) the possibility that salmonella can re-
colonize in turtles; 
(ii) the dangers, including possible severe 
illness or death, especially for at-risk people 
who may be susceptible to salmonella poisoning, 
such as children, pregnant women, 
and others who may have weak immune systems, 
that could result if the turtle is not 
properly handled and safely maintained; 
(iii) the proper handling of the turtle, including 
an explanation of proper hygiene 
such as handwashing after handling a turtle; 
and 
(iv) the proven methods of treatment that, 
if properly applied, keep the turtle safe from 
salmonella; 
(B) a detailed explanation of how to properly 
treat the turtle to keep it safe from salmonella, 
using the proven methods of treatment 
referred to under subparagraph (A), 
and how the buyer can continue to purchase 
the tools, treatments, or any other required 
item to continually treat the turtle; and 
(C) a statement that buyers of pet turtles 
should not abandon the turtle or abandon it 
outside, as the turtle may become an 
invasive species to the local community, but 
should instead return them to a commercial 
retail pet seller or other organization that 
would accept turtles no longer wanted as 
pets. 
(b) FDA REVIEW OF STATE PROTECTIONS.— 
The Food and Drug Administration may, 
after providing an opportunity for the affected 
State to respond, restrict the sale of a 
turtle only if the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services determines that the actual 
implementation of State health protections 
described in subsection (a) are insufficient to 
protect consumers against infectious diseases 
acquired from such turtles at the time 
of sale. 
SA 1005. Mr. LEVIN submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed by 
him to the bill S. 1082, to amend the

such meat red beyond the point of spoilage of

‘‘(H) In a case where a drug may be prescribed 
only by a physician with particular 
training or experience, or who is specially 
certified, a health care provider who is not 
so certified or trained to prescribe the drug 
may enter into a cooperation plan with a 
physician who has particular training or experience, 
or is specially certified, in order to 
prescribe such drug with the informed consent 
of the patient. The Commissioner of 
Food and Drugs shall determine the requirements 
for such cooperation plan. 

SA 1007. Mr. REID (for Mr. BUNNING) 
proposed an amendment to the resolution 
S. Res. 162, commemorating and 
acknowledging the dedication and sacrifice 
made by the men and women who 
have lost their lives while serving as

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the resolution be 
agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, 
the motion to reconsider be laid upon

thereto be printed in the RECORD 
as if read. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 


The resolution (S. Res. 155) was 

agreed to. 

The preamble was agreed to. 

The resolution, with its preamble, 

reads as follows: 
S. RES. 155 
Whereas warring parties in Guatemala 
ended a 36-year internal armed conflict with 
a peace agreement in 1996, but the country 
has since faced alarming levels of violence, 
organized crime, and corruption; 
Whereas the alleged involvement of senior 
officials of the National Civilian Police in 
the murder of three Salvadoran parliamentarians 
and their driver, and the subsequent 
killing of four of the police officers while in 
custody underscored the need to purge and 
strengthen law enforcement and judicial institutions 
in Guatemala; 
Whereas high-level officials of the Government 
of Guatemala have acknowledged the 
infiltration of organized criminal networks 
into the state apparatus and the difficulty of 
combating these networks when they are 
deeply entrenched in public institutions; 
Whereas, in its 2006 Country Report on 
Human Rights Practices in Guatemala, the 
Department of State noted that police corruption 
was a serious problem in Guatemala 
and that there were credible allegations of 
involvement by individual police officers in 
criminal activity, including rapes, killings, 
and kidnappings; 
Whereas, in its most recent report on Guatemala, 
the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights notes that impunity 
continues to undermine the credibility 
of the justice system in Guatemala and that 
the justice system is still too weak to confront 
organized crime and its powerful structures; 
and 
Whereas, the Government of Guatemala 
and the United Nations signed an agreement 
on December 12, 2006, to establish the International 
Commission against Impunity in 
Guatemala (Comisio´n Internacional Contra 
la Impunidad en Guatemala—CICIG), to assist 
local authorities in investigating and 
dismantling the illegal security groups and 
clandestine organizations that continue to 
operate in Guatemala: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 

(1) it is the sense of the Senate that the 
International Commission against Impunity 
in Guatemala is an innovative mechanism to 
support local efforts to confront the entrenched 
and dangerous problem posed by illegal 
armed groups and clandestine security 
organizations in Guatemala and their infiltration 
into state institutions; 
(2) the Senate commends the Government 
of Guatemala, local civil society organizations, 
and the United Nations for such a creative 
effort; 
(3) the Senate encourages the Guatemalan 
Congress to enact necessary legislation required 
to implement the International Commission 
against Impunity in Guatemala and 
other pending legislation needed to fulfill 
the 1996 peace agreement; 
(4) the Senate calls on the Government of 
Guatemala and all sectors of society in Guatemala 
to unreservedly support the investigation 
and prosecution of illegal armed 
groups and clandestine security organizations; 
and 
(5) the Senate reiterates its commitment 
to support the Government of Guatemala in 
its efforts to strengthen the rule of law in 
that country, including the dismantling of 
the clandestine groups, the purging of the 
police and judicial institutions, and the implementation 
of key justice and police reforms.

THE PASSING OF MR. JACK 
VALENTI 

Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to 
honor my good friend Jack Valenti, 
who, passed away last week on April 26. 

Throughout his life, Jack Valenti 
wore several hats, including that of a 
soldier, a devoted public servant, and a 
pioneer in the film industry. 

Jack was born on September 5, 1921, 
in Houston, TX and was the grandson 
of Sicilian immigrants. At age 15, he 
became the youngest high school graduate 
in the history of the city of Houston 
and began a career as an office boy 
with Exxon Oil. 

Jack served honorably in the Army 
Air Corps during World War II, flying 
in 51 separate combat missions as pilot 
of the B–25 attack bomber with the 
12th Air Force in Italy. He obtained the 
rank of lieutenant and received multiple 
decorations, including the Distinguished 
Flying Cross, the Air Medal 
with four clusters, the Distinguished 
Unit Citation with one cluster, and the 
European Theater Ribbon with four 
battle stars. 

After serving in the war, Jack attended 
college at the University of 
Houston, doing all his undergraduate 
work at night as he worked during the 
day. He earned a bachelor of arts degree 
in 1946 and later became the University 
of Houston’s first graduate ever 
to be admitted to Harvard Business 
School. He received an MBA from Harvard 
in 1948. 

In the intervening years, Jack held 
many positions in this town, but in 1966 
Jack resigned from a top position in 
the White House to become only the 
third president of the Motion Picture 

Association of America, MPAA. He 
held this, his most famous position, for 
38 years before retiring in 2004. 

As president of MPAA, Jack arbitrated 
one of the most famous developments 
the film industry has ever come 
out with—the voluntary rating system. 
The ratings ‘‘G,’’ ‘‘PG,’’ ‘‘PG–13’’ and 
‘‘R’’ have become staples, not only in 
the movie-going practices of every 
American but also in our Nation’s cultural 
consciousness. However, more important 
than the societal notions and 
the cliche´d images associated with 
these ratings is the real assistance that 
this system has provided to parents 
and families in evaluating the appropriateness 
of various movies. Indeed, 
the MPAA rating system pioneered by 
Jack Valenti has become a prime example 
of the effectiveness of industry 
self-regulation without government 
intervention, and I am very grateful 
for Jack’s work in this area even when 
many in his industry fought him along 
the way. 

In addition to pioneering the rating 
system, Jack Valenti also worked to 
advance the film industry into the 21st 
century. Indeed, during his tenure at 
the MPAA, he presided over unprecedented 
changes in the worldwide film 
industry, including the advancement of 
the digital era. I remember having several 
conversations with Jack as the 
film industry struggled to deal with 
the new challenges presented by digital 
distribution of their content. Together, 
Jack and I worked tirelessly to balance 
the competing demands of consumer’s 
rights and the protection of one of 
America’s largest exports—entertainment. 


With Jack’s help, we were able to 
refocus the Federal Government’s resources 
to more effectively protect the 
creative genius of a great American industry—
the film industry. We all know 
how blatantly some bad actors around 
the world pirate America’s movies and 
rob the United States of jobs. Thanks 
to Jack’s efforts, we have made great 
strides in this area and laid the 
groundwork to allow us to stamp out 
this criminal activity in the years 
ahead. Combating the theft and piracy 
of intellectual property was a real passion 
for Jack, and I was privileged to 
work with him in this endeavor. 

Mr. President, those of us who knew 
Jack Valenti personally will always remember 
him as a charitable man who 
was devoted to his family. While his influence 
on the film industry has been 
famous and unmistakable, many of us 
will remember him more for the personal 
friendship we shared with him. I 
will miss him greatly. 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the resolution be 
agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, 
the motion to reconsider be laid upon 
the table, and that any statements relating 
to the resolution be printed in 
the RECORD.

NATIONAL CHARTER SCHOOLS 
WEEK 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed 
to the consideration of S. Res. 183. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The clerk will report the resolution 
by title. 

The legislative clerk read as follows: 

A resolution (S. Res. 183) supporting the 
goals and ideals of National Charter Schools 
Week, April 30, 2007, through May 4, 2007. 

There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today 
I wish to honor National Charter 
School Week. The role of charter 
schools has become increasingly important 
as these institutions have become 
one of the fastest growing innovative 
forces in education policy. The District 
of Columbia and 40 States have laws 
that allow charter schools. There are 
over 4,000 public charter schools serving 
more than 1.1 million students and 
there are many more students on waiting 
lists who want to attend. 

As many of you know, I have been a 
part of that charter school growth, 
both here in Washington, DC, and in 
my home, Louisiana. Today, more than 
30 percent of all DC public school students 
attend charter schools and are 
largely successful. These charter 
school projects are largely successful. 
These charter schools not only help to 
better educate students, but are also 
helping to build a better, stronger, 
more prosperous city. 

In addition to having an impact in 
Washington, DC, charter schools are 
also helping to rebuild the school system 
in New Orleans. Hurricanes 
Katrina and Rita did not just wash 
away our levees—they also washed 
away our homes and schools. We must 
seize upon this opportunity and build a 
better, stronger school system for New 
Orleans and throughout Louisiana. 

Charter schools are key players in 
this process by not only rebuilding our 
school system, but reinventing it. 
Every step in this process is based on 
what is best for our students, with the 
goal of delivering learning and achievement 
for all students. The new school 
system effectively eliminates the previous 
system of have and have-nots, allowing 
parents to choose from any 
school in the network, making quality 
school options available to all students 
and raising the bar for educators 
throughout the system. 

The new Educational Network Model 
will organize schools, the majority of 
them charters, into small groups to 
provide support, foster collaboration 
and ensure accountability. This will 
shift the majority of money and decisionmaking 
to the school level, where 
it can be managed based on the needs 
of the students in each school. It will 
also create a lean district office focused 
on academic standards and performance 
monitoring, allowing more 
dollars to go to schools. Finally, it will 
migrate toward a single, aligned and 
highly-effective governing board that 
provides a stable leadership team with 
skills to oversee successful implementation 
of the plan. 

Today, over 50 percent of our schools 
in New Orleans have reopened as charter 
schools. They have provided us with 
an expedient means to restart public 
education in New Orleans. It is my 
hope that we can continue this trend 
by utilizing the Educational Network 
Model for these schools and others nationwide 
by engaging community involvement 
and support through a 
shared services model. 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the resolution be 
agreed, the preamble be agreed to, the 
motion to reconsider be laid upon the 
table, and that any statements relating 
to the resolution be printed in the 
RECORD, with no intervening action or 
debate. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 


The resolution (S. Res. 183) was 

agreed to. 

The preamble was agreed to. 

The resolution, with its preamble, 

reads as follows: 
S. RES. 183 
Whereas charter schools deliver high-quality 
education and challenge students to 
reach their potential; 
Whereas charter schools provide thousands 
of families with diverse and innovative educational 
options for their children; 
Whereas charter schools are public schools 
authorized by designated public entities to 
respond to the needs of communities, families, 
and students, and to promote the principles 
of quality, choice, and innovation; 
Whereas, in exchange for the flexibility 
and autonomy given to charter schools, 
charter schools are held accountable by their 
sponsors for improving student achievement 
and for their finances and other operations; 
Whereas 40 States and the District of Columbia 
have passed laws authorizing charter 
schools; 
Whereas more than 4,000 charter schools 
operating across the United States serve 
more than 1,140,000 students; 
Whereas, over the last 13 years, Congress 
has provided more than $2,026,225,000 in support 
to the charter school movement by providing 
facilities, financing assistance, and 
grants for planning, startup, implementation, 
and dissemination of information; 
Whereas many charter schools improve the 
achievement of students and stimulate improvement 
in traditional public schools; 
Whereas charter schools must meet the 
student achievement accountability requirements 
under section 1111 of the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 

U.S.C. 6311) in the same manner as traditional 
public schools, and often set higher 
and additional individual goals to ensure 
that charter schools are of high quality and 
truly accountable to the public; 

Whereas charter schools give parents new 
freedom to choose public schools, routinely 
measure parental satisfaction levels, and 
must prove their ongoing success to parents, 
policymakers, and communities; 

Whereas nearly 56 percent of charter 
schools report having a waiting list, and the 
total number of students on all such waiting 
lists is enough to fill over 1,100 average-sized 
charter schools; 

Whereas charter schools nationwide serve 
a higher percentage of low-income and minority 
students than the traditional public 
school system; 

Whereas charter schools have enjoyed 
broad bipartisan support from the President, 
Congress, State governors and legislatures, 
educators, and parents across the United 
States; and 

Whereas the eighth annual National Charter 
Schools Week, to be held April 30 through 
May 4, 2007, is an event sponsored by charter 
schools and grassroots charter school organizations 
across the United States to recognize 
the significant impacts, achievements, and 
innovations of charter schools: Now, therefore, 
be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) acknowledges and commends charter 
schools and students, parents, teachers, and 
administrators of charter schools across the 
United States for their ongoing contributions 
to education and improving and 
strengthening the public school system; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of the 
eighth annual National Charter Schools 
Week; and 
(3) encourages the people of the United 
States to conduct appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities to demonstrate 
support for charter schools during this week-
long celebration in communities throughout 
the United States.

The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 184) expressing the 
sense of the Senate with respect to childhood 
stroke and designating May 5, 2007 as ‘‘National 
Childhood Stroke Awareness Day.’’ 
There being no objection, the Senate

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the resolution be 
agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, 
and the motion to reconsider be laid 
upon the table. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 184) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
The resolution, with its preamble, 
reads as follows: 
S RES. 184 
Whereas a stroke, also known as a ‘‘cerebrovascular 
accident’’, is an acute neurologic 
injury that occurs when the blood supply to 
a part of the brain is interrupted by a clot in 
the artery or a burst of the artery; 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5435 

Whereas a stroke is a medical emergency 
that can cause permanent neurologic damage 
or even death if not promptly diagnosed and 
treated; 

Whereas 26 out of every 100,000 newborns 
and almost 3 out of every 100,000 children 
have a stroke each year; 

Whereas an individual can have a stroke 
before birth; 

Whereas stroke is among the top 10 causes 
of death for children in the United States; 

Whereas 12 percent of all children who experience 
a stroke die as a result; 

Whereas the death rate for children who 
experience a stroke before the age of 1 year 
is the highest out of all age groups; 

Whereas many children who experience a 
stroke will suffer serious, long-term neurological 
disabilities, including— 

(1) hemiplegia, which is paralysis of 1 side 
of the body; 
(2) seizures; 
(3) speech and vision problems; and 
(4) learning difficulties; 
Whereas those disabilities may require ongoing 
physical therapy and surgeries; 
Whereas the permanent health concerns 
and treatments resulting from strokes that 
occur during childhood and young adulthood 
have a considerable impact on children, families, 
and society; 

Whereas very little is known about the 
cause, treatment, and prevention of childhood 
stroke; 

Whereas medical research is the only 
means by which the citizens of the United 
States can identify and develop effective 
treatment and prevention strategies for 
childhood stroke; 

Whereas early diagnosis and treatment of 
childhood stroke greatly improves the 
chances that the affected child will recover 
and not experience a recurrence; and 

Whereas the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia 
should be commended for its initiative 
in creating the Nation’s first program 
dedicated to pediatric stroke patients: Now, 
therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) designates May 5, 2007 as ‘‘National 
Childhood Stroke Awareness Day’’; and 
(2) urges the people of the United States to 
support the efforts, programs, services, and 
advocacy of organizations that work to enhance 
public awareness of childhood stroke.

URGING ALL MEMBER COUNTRIES 
OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION 
OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
TRACING SERVICE TO 
EXPEDITE THE RATIFICATION 
PROCESS 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Foreign Relations 
Committee be discharged from 
further consideration of S. Res. 141. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the resolution 
by title. 

The legislative clerk read as follows: 

A resolution (S. Res. 141) urging all member 
countries of the International Commission 
of the International Tracing Service 
who have yet to ratify the May 2006 amendments 
to the 1955 Bonn Accords to expedite 
the ratification process to allow for open access 
to the Holocaust archives located at Bad 
Arolsen, Germany. 

There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 

Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent 
that the resolution be agreed to, the 

preamble be agreed to, the motion to 
reconsider be laid on the table, and any 
statements be printed in the RECORD. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 


The resolution (S. Res. 141) was 

agreed to. 

The preamble was agreed to. 

The resolution, with its preamble, 

reads as follows: 
S. RES. 141 
Whereas the International Tracing Service 
(ITS) archives located in Bad Arolsen, Germany, 
which are administered by the International 
Committee of the Red Cross, contain 
an estimated 50,000,000 records on the 
fates of some 17,500,000 individual victims of 
Nazi war crimes; 
Whereas the ITS archives at Bad Arolsen 
remain the largest closed Holocaust-era archives 
in the world; 
Whereas, although access to individual 
records can be requested by Holocaust survivors 
and their descendants, many who have 
requested information from the ITS archives 
have reported facing significant delays and 
even unresponsiveness; 
Whereas the ITS archives remain inaccessible 
to researchers and research institutions; 
Whereas the Agreement Constituting an 
International Commission for the International 
Tracing Service, signed at Bonn 
June 6, 1955 (6 UST 6186) (commonly known 
as the ‘‘Bonn Accords’’) established an international 
commission of 11 member countries 
(Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, 
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, 
the United Kingdom, and the United States) 
charged with overseeing the administration 
of the ITS Holocaust archives; 
Whereas, following years of delay, in May 
2006 in Luxembourg, the International Commission 
of the ITS agreed upon amendments 
to the Bonn Accords that would allow researchers 
to use the archives and would 
allow each member country of the International 
Commission to receive digitized 
copies of archive materials and make the 
records available to researchers under the respective 
national laws relating to archives 
and privacy; 
Whereas the May 2006 amendments to the 
Bonn Accords require each of the 11 member 
countries of the International Commission 
to ratify the amendments before open access 
to the Holocaust archives is permitted; 
Whereas, although the final signature was 
affixed to the amendments in October 2006, 
only 5 out of the 11 member countries of the 
International Commission, the United 
States, Israel, Poland, the Netherlands, and 
the United Kingdom, have ratified the 
amendments; 
Whereas the United States Holocaust Memorial 
Museum has for years been working 
tirelessly to provide public access to the materials 
in the Bad Arolsen archives; 
Whereas, on March 8, 2007, representatives 
from the 11 member countries of the International 
Commission of the ITS met in the 
Netherlands and reviewed the current ratification 
status of each country and the ratification 
process in its entirety; 
Whereas it is a moral and humanitarian 
imperative to permit public access to the 
millions of Holocaust records housed at Bad 
Arolsen; 
Whereas it is essential that researchers obtain 
access while Holocaust survivors are living, 
so that the researchers can benefit in 
their scholarly work from the insights of 
eyewitnesses; 
Whereas, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, 
there have been far too many in


stances of survivors and heirs of Holocaust 
victims being refused their moral and legal 
right to information, for restitution purposes, 
slave labor compensation, and personal 
closure; 

Whereas opening the historic records is a 
vital contribution to the world’s collective 
memory and understanding of the Holocaust 
and efforts to ensure that the anti-Semitism 
that made such horrors possible is never 
again permitted to take hold; 

Whereas anti-Semitism has seen a resurgence 
in recent years, and as recently as December 
2006, the President of Iran, Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad, held the second Holocaust denial 
conference in Tehran in one year; and 

Whereas in light of this conference, the 
anti-Semitic rhetoric of President 
Ahmadinejad, and a resurgence of anti-Semitism 
in part of the world, the opening of the 
archives at Bad Arolsen could not be more 
urgent: Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) commends in the strongest terms all 
countries that have to date ratified the 
amendments to the Agreement Constituting 
an International Commission for the International 
Tracing Service, signed at Bonn 
June 6, 1955 (6 UST 6186) (commonly known 
as the ‘‘Bonn Accords’’) to allow for open access 
to the Holocaust archives of the International 
Tracing Service (ITS) located at 
Bad Arolsen, Germany; 
(2) commends the countries that have committed 
to expedite the process of releasing 
the archives and expects those countries to 
abide by their commitments; 
(3) strongly urges all countries that have 
to yet to ratify the amendments to abide by 
the treaty obligations made in May 2006 and 
to expedite the ratification of the amendments; 
(4) strongly urges all member countries of 
the International Commission of the ITS to 
consider the short time left to Holocaust 
survivors and unanimously consent to open 
the ITS archives should all countries not 
ratify the amendments by May 2007; 
(5) expresses the hope that bureaucratic 
and diplomatic processes will not further 
delay this process; and 
(6) refuses to forget the murder of 6,000,000 
Jews and more than 5,000,000 other victims 
during the Holocaust by Nazi perpetrators 
and their collaborators.

S5436 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

The preamble was agreed to. 
The resolution, with its preamble, 
reads as follows: 
S. RES. 177 

Whereas many nations throughout the 
world, and especially within the Western 
hemisphere, celebrate ‘‘Di´a de los Nin˜os’’, or 
‘‘Day of the Children’’ on the 30th of April, in 
recognition and celebration of their country’s 
future—their children; 

Whereas children represent the hopes and 
dreams of the people of the United States; 

Whereas children are the center of American 
families; 

Whereas children should be nurtured and 
invested in to preserve and enhance economic 
prosperity, democracy, and the American 
spirit; 

Whereas Hispanics in the United States, 
the youngest and fastest growing ethnic 
community in the Nation, continue the tradition 
of honoring their children on this day, 
and wish to share this custom with the rest 
of the Nation; 

Whereas it is projected that by the year 
2050, 1 in 4 Americans will be of Hispanic descent, 
and currently approximately 12,300,000 
Hispanic children live in the United States; 

Whereas traditional Hispanic family life 
centers largely on children; 

Whereas the primary teachers of family 
values, morality, and culture are parents and 
family members, and we rely on children to 
pass on these family values, morals, and culture 
to future generations; 

Whereas more than 500,000 children drop 
out of school each year, 138,000 of whom are 
Hispanic, and these dropout rates are unacceptably 
high; 

Whereas the importance of literacy and 
education are most often communicated to 
children through family members; 

Whereas families should be encouraged to 
engage in family and community activities 
that include extended and elderly family 
members and encourage children to explore, 
develop confidence, and pursue their dreams; 

Whereas the designation of a day to honor 
the children of the United States will help 
affirm for the people of the United States the 
significance of family, education, and community; 


Whereas the designation of a day of special 
recognition for the children of the United 
States will provide an opportunity for children 
to reflect on their future, to articulate 
their dreams and aspirations, and to find 
comfort and security in the support of their 
family members and communities; 

Whereas the National Latino Children’s Institute, 
serving as a voice for children, has 
worked with cities throughout the country 
to declare April 30 as ‘‘Di´a de los Nin˜ os: Celebrating 
Young Americans’’—a day to bring 
together Hispanics and other communities 
nationwide to celebrate and uplift children; 
and 

Whereas the children of a nation are the 
responsibility of all its people, and people 
should be encouraged to celebrate the gifts 
of children to society—their curiosity, 
laughter, faith, energy, spirit, hopes, and 
dreams: Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) designates April 30, 2007, as ‘‘Di´a de los 
Nin˜ os: Celebrating Young Americans’’; and 
(2) calls on the people of the United States

communities, churches, cities, and 
States across the United States to observe 
the day with appropriate ceremonies, including 
activities that— 
(A) center around children, and are free or 
minimal in cost so as to encourage and facilitate 
the participation of all our people;

children express their hopes and dreams; 
(C) provide opportunities for children of all 
backgrounds to learn about one another’s 
cultures and to share ideas; 
(D) include all members of the family, especially 
extended and elderly family members, 
so as to promote greater communication 
among the generations within a family, 
enabling children to appreciate and benefit 
from the experiences and wisdom of their elderly 
family members; 
(E) provide opportunities for families within 
a community to get acquainted; and 
(F) provide children with the support they 
need to develop skills and confidence, and to 
find the inner strength—the will and fire of 
the human spirit—to make their dreams 
come true.

DESIGNATING MAY 2007 AS ‘‘NA


TIONAL AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES 

AWARENESS MONTH’’ 

The resolution (S. Res. 116) designating 
May 2007 as ‘‘National Autoimmune 
Diseases Awareness Month’’ 
and supporting efforts to increase 
awareness of autoimmune diseases and 
increase funding for autoimmune disease 
research was agreed to; as follows: 

S. RES. 116 
Whereas autoimmune diseases are chronic, 
disabling diseases in which underlying defects 
in the immune system lead the body to 
attack its own organs and tissues; 
Whereas autoimmune diseases can affect 
any part of the body, including the blood, 
blood vessels, muscles, nervous system, gastrointestinal 
tract, endocrine glands, and 
multiple-organ systems, and can be life-
threatening; 
Whereas researchers have identified over 80 
different autoimmune diseases, and suspect 
at least 40 additional diseases of qualifying 
as autoimmune diseases; 
Whereas researchers have identified a close 
genetic relationship and a common pathway 
of disease that exists among autoimmune 
diseases, explaining the clustering of autoimmune 
diseases in individuals and families; 
Whereas the family of autoimmune diseases 
is under-recognized, and poses a major 
health care challenge to the United States; 
Whereas the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) estimates that autoimmune diseases 
afflict up to 23,500,000 people in the United 

States, 75 percent of the people affected are 
women, and the prevalence of autoimmune 
diseases is rising; 

Whereas NIH estimates the annual direct 
health care costs associated with autoimmune 
diseases at more than $100,000,000,000 
and there are over 250,000 new diagnoses each 
year; 

Whereas autoimmune diseases are among 
the top 10 leading causes of death in female 
children and adult women; 

Whereas autoimmune diseases most often 
affect children and young adults, leading to 
a lifetime of disability; 

Whereas diagnostic tests for most autoimmune 
diseases are not standardized, making 
autoimmune diseases very difficult to diagnose; 


Whereas, because autoimmune diseases are 
difficult to diagnose, treatment is often delayed, 
resulting in irreparable organ damage 
and unnecessary suffering; 

Whereas the Institute of Medicine of the 
National Academies reported that the United 
States is behind other countries in research 
into immune system self-recognition, the 
cause of autoimmune diseases; 

Whereas a study by the American Autoimmune 
Related Diseases Association revealed 
that it takes the average patient with 
an autoimmune disease more than 4 years, 
and costs more than $50,000, to get a correct 
diagnosis; 

Whereas there is a significant need for 
more collaboration and cross-fertilization of 
basic autoimmune research; 

Whereas there is a significant need for research 
focusing on the etiology of all auto-
immune-related diseases, to increase understanding 
of the root causes of these diseases 
rather treating the symptoms after the disease 
has had its destructive effect; 

Whereas the National Coalition of Autoimmune 
Patient Groups is a coalition of national 
organizations focused on autoimmune 
diseases working to consolidate the voices of 
patients with autoimmune diseases and to 
promote increased education, awareness, and 
research into all aspects of autoimmune diseases 
through a collaborative approach; and 

Whereas designating May 2007 as ‘‘National 
Autoimmune Diseases Awareness Month’’ 
would help educate the public about autoimmune 
diseases and the need for research 
funding, accurate diagnosis, and effective 
treatments: Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) designates May 2007 as ‘‘National Autoimmune 
Diseases Awareness Month’’; 
(2) supports the efforts of health care providers 
and autoimmune patient advocacy 
and education organizations to increase 
awareness of the causes of, and treatments 
for, autoimmune diseases; and 
(3) supports the goal of increasing Federal 
funding for aggressive research to learn the 
root causes of autoimmune diseases, as well 
as the best diagnostic methods and treatments 
for people with autoimmune diseases.

ENDANGERED SPECIES DAY 

The resolution (S. Res. 125) designating 
May 18, 2007, as ‘‘Endangered 
Species Day,’’ and encouraging the people 
of the United States to become educated 
about, and aware of, threats to 
species, success stories in species recovery, 
and the opportunity to promote 
species conservation worldwide, 
was agreed to. The preamble was 
agreed to. The resolution (S. Res. 125), 
with its preamble, reads as follows: 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5437 

S. RES. 125 

Whereas in the United States and around 
the world, more than 1,000 species are officially 
designated as at risk of extinction and 
thousands more also face a heightened risk 
of extinction; 

Whereas the actual and potential benefits 
derived from many species have not yet been 
fully discovered and would be permanently 
lost if not for conservation efforts; 

Whereas recovery efforts for species such 
as the whooping crane, Kirtland’s warbler, 
the peregrine falcon, the gray wolf, the gray 
whale, the grizzly bear, and others have resulted 
in great improvements in the viability 
of such species; 

Whereas saving a species requires a combination 
of sound research, careful coordination, 
and intensive management of conservation 
efforts, along with increased public 
awareness and education; 

Whereas two-thirds of endangered or 
threatened species reside on private lands; 

Whereas voluntary cooperative conservation 
programs have proven to be critical for 
habitat restoration and species recovery; and 

Whereas education and increasing public 
awareness are the first steps in effectively 
informing the public about endangered species 
and species restoration efforts: Now, 
therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) designates May 18, 2007, as ‘‘Endangered 
Species Day’’; and 
(2) encourages— 
(A) educational entities to spend at least 30 
minutes on Endangered Species Day teaching 
and informing students about threats to, 
and the restoration of, endangered species 
around the world, including the essential 
role of private landowners and private stewardship 
to the protection and recovery of 
species; 
(B) organizations, businesses, private landowners, 
and agencies with a shared interest 
in conserving endangered species to collaborate 
on educational information for use in 
schools; and 
(C) the people of the United States to observe 
the day with appropriate ceremonies 
and activities.

DESIGNATING JUNE 20, 2007, AS 
‘‘AMERICAN EAGLE DAY’’ 

The resolution (S. Res. 146) Designating 
June 20, 2007, as ‘‘American 
Eagle Day,’’ and celebrating the recovery 
and restoration of the American 
bald eagle, the national symbol of the 
United States, was agreed to; as follows: 


S. RES. 146 
Whereas, the bald eagle was designated as 
the national emblem of the United States on 
June 20, 1782, by our country’s Founding Fathers 
at the Second Continental Congress; 
Whereas, the bald eagle is the central 
image used in the Great Seal of the United 
States and the seals of the President and 
Vice President; 
Whereas, the image of the bald eagle is displayed 
in the official seal of many branches 
and departments of the Federal Government, 
including— 

(1) Congress; 
(2) the Supreme Court; 
(3) the Department of Defense; 
(4) the Department of the Treasury; 
(5) the Department of Justice; 
(6) the Department of State; 
(7) the Department of Commerce; 
(8) the Department of Homeland Security; 
(9) the Department of Veterans Affairs; 
(10) the Department of Labor; 
(11) the Department of Health and Human 
Services; 
(12) the Department of Energy; 
(13) the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development; 
(14) the Central Intelligence Agency; and 
(15) the United States Postal Service; 
Whereas, the bald eagle is an inspiring 
symbol of the American spirit of freedom 
and democracy; 

Whereas, the image, meaning, and symbolism 
of the bald eagle have played a significant 
role in American art, music, history, 
literature, architecture, and culture 
since the founding of our Nation; 

Whereas, the bald eagle is featured prominently 
on United States stamps, currency, 
and coinage; 

Whereas, the habitat of bald eagles exists 
only in North America; 

Whereas, by 1963, the number of nesting 
pairs of bald eagles in the lower 48 States 
had dropped to about 417; 

Whereas, the bald eagle was first listed as 
an endangered species in 1967 under the Endangered 
Species Preservation Act, the Federal 
law that preceded the Endangered Species 
Act of 1973; 

Whereas, caring and concerned citizens of 
the United States in the private and public 
sectors banded together to save, and help ensure 
the protection of, bald eagles; 

Whereas, in 1995, as a result of the efforts 
of those caring and concerned citizens, bald 
eagles were removed from the ‘‘endangered’’ 
species list and upgraded to the less imperiled 
‘‘threatened’’ status under the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973; 

Whereas, by 2006, the number of bald eagles 
in the lower 48 States had increased to approximately 
7,000 to 8,000 nesting pairs; 

Whereas, the administration is likely to officially 
delist the bald eagle from both the 
‘‘endangered’’ and ‘‘threatened’’ species lists 
under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
with a final decision expected no later than 
June 29, 2007; 

Whereas, if delisted under the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973, bald eagles should be 
provided strong protection under the Bald 
and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory 
Bird Treaty Act; 

Whereas, bald eagles would have been permanently 
extinct if not for vigilant conservation 
efforts of concerned citizens and 
strict protection laws; 

Whereas, the dramatic recovery of the bald 
eagle population is an endangered species 
success story and an inspirational example 
for other wildlife and natural resource conservation 
efforts around the world; 

Whereas, the initial recovery of the bald 
eagle population was accomplished by the 
concerted efforts of numerous government 
agencies, corporations, organizations, and 
individuals; and 

Whereas, the sustained recovery of the 
bald eagle population will require the continuation 
of recovery, management, education, 
and public awareness programs, to 
ensure that the population and habitat of 
bald eagles will remain healthy and secure 
for future generations: Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) designates June 20, 2007, as ‘‘American 
Eagle Day’’; and 
(2) encourages— 
(A) educational entities, organizations, 
businesses, conservation groups, and government 
agencies with a shared interest in conserving 
endangered species to collaborate on 
education information for use in schools; and 
(B) the people of the United States to observe 
American Eagle Day with appropriate 
ceremonies and other activities. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am 
pleased that today the Senate has 

agreed to S. Res. 146, a bipartisan resolution 
establishing a national American 
Eagle Day, on June 20, 2007, the 
day the bald eagle was selected as our 
national emblem during the Second 
Continental Congress in 1782. I am delighted 
that the bald eagle is scheduled 
to be ‘‘delisted’’ from the Endangered 
Species Act on June 20 of this year. I 
commend Senators ALEXANDER and 
BYRD for their work on this resolution. 

The bald eagle has been protected 
under Federal law since Congress 
passed the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection 
Act in 1940. This law prohibits 
the taking, possessing, or commerce of 
both bald and golden eagles. The Endangered 
Species Act of 1973 reinforced 
protection of the bald eagle. I am a 
longtime supporter of the Endangered 
Species Act, a landmark environmental 
law that provides crucial protection 
to fish and wildlife on the verge 
of extinction. 

Vermont is actually one of the only 
States in the continental United States 
without nesting bald eagles. Senator 
JEFFORDS funded a program about 
three years ago where orphaned or 
threatened nestlings were relocated 
from sites between Maryland and 
Maine to nests in the Dead Creek State 
wildlife management area in Addison 
County, VT, along Lake Champlain. 

About 25 individual birds were successfully 
raised and released from nests 
there. While eagles usually return to 
nest in the general area where they 
were nestlings, it can take up to 4 
years. Vermont fish and wildlife staff 
are closely monitoring the effort to see 
if Vermont will be successful in joining 
other states as a home to the bald 
eagle. 

I support the passage of this resolution, 
which would allow all of us to celebrate 
the successful recovery of the 
bald eagle, and to remember the freedoms 
and ideals that the eagle represents 
as a symbol of our country.

SACRIFICE MADE BY THE MEN 
AND WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST 
THEIR LIVES WHILE SERVING AS 
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 

The Senate proceeded to consider the 
resolution (S. Res. 162) commemorating 
and acknowledging the dedication and 
sacrifice made by the men and women 
who have lost their lives while serving 
as law enforcement officers. 

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am 
pleased the Senate is considering today 
a bipartisan resolution to designate 
May 15, 2007, as National Peace Officers 
Memorial Day that Senator SPECTER 
and I introduced along with the majority 
leader, and Senators BIDEN, GRASSLEY, 
CORNYN, STABENOW, MENENDEZ, 
DURBIN, KOHL, KENNEDY and 
BROWNBACK. Last week, the Judiciary 
Committee favorably reported this resolution 
unanimously. I thank all members 
of the Judiciary Committee and 
the cosponsors on this bipartisan resolution 
for their support in recognizing 


S5438 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE May 1, 2007 

the sacrifices that law enforcement officers 
make each day for the American 
people. 

This is now the eleventh year running 
that I have been involved in this 
resolution to honor the sacrifice and 
commitment of those law enforcement 
officers who give their lives serving 
their communities. For many years I 
introduced this resolution with my 
friend Senator CAMPBELL, a former 
deputy sheriff. Both SENATOR CAMPBELL, 
and I, as a former prosecutor, 
witnessed firsthand the risks faced by 
law enforcement officers every day 
while they serve and protect our communities. 
I am pleased that Senator 
SPECTER, himself a former prosecutor, 
former chair of the Judiciary Committee, 
and now our ranking member, 
has become the lead Republican sponsor 
of this bipartisan measure. 

Currently, more than 870,000 men and 
women who guard our communities do 
so at great risk. After the hijacked 
planes hit the World Trade Center in 
New York City on September 11, 2001, 
72 peace officers died while trying to 
ensure that their fellow citizens in 
those buildings got to safety. That act 
of terrorism resulted in the highest 
number of peace officers ever killed in 
a single incident in the history of our 
country, and is a tragic reminder of 
how important it is for the Congress to 
provide all of the resources necessary 
to protect officers in the line of duty. 

Since the first recorded police death 
in 1792, there have been more than 
17,900 law enforcement officers who 
have made the ultimate sacrifice. We 
are fortunate in Vermont that we rank 
as the State with the fewest officer 
deaths in history. With 19 deaths, however, 
that is 19 deaths too many. In 
2006, 147 law enforcement officers died 
while serving in the line of duty, well 
below the decade-long average of 165 
deaths annually, and a drop from 2005 
when 156 officers were killed. That is 
147 officers too many. We need to continue 
our support for better equipment 
and the increased use of bullet-resistant 
vests, improved training, and advanced 
emergency medical care. I hope 
as the 110th Congress moves forward 
that all Senators can work together to 
ensure that all of our law enforcement 
officers and their families have the full 
support and the resources they need 
from the Federal Government. 

I am proud of the work I have been 
involved in to help make it safer on the 
beat for our officers. Back in 1998, Senator 
Campbell and I authored the Bulletproof 
Vest Grant Partnership Act in 
response to the tragic Carl Drega 
shootout on the Vermont-New Hampshire 
border, in which two State troopers 
who lacked bulletproof vests were 
killed. Since then, we have successfully 
reauthorized this program three more 
times: In the Bulletproof Vest Partnership 
Grant Act of 2000, in the State 
Justice Institute Reauthorization Act 
of 2004, and most recently as part of 
the Violence Against Women and Department 
of Justice Reauthorization 

Act of 2005. It is now authorized at $50 
million per year through fiscal year 
2009 to help State, tribal and local jurisdictions 
purchase armor vests for 
use by law enforcement officers. I have 
already begun to work with my colleagues 
to make sure that the bulletproof 
vest partnership grant program is 
fully funded this year. Bulletproof 
vests have saved the lives of thousands 
of officers and are a fundamental line 
of defense that no officer should be 
without. I know I am not alone in calling 
for the Senate to fully fund the bulletproof 
vest partnership program and I 
hope the Congress agrees that it is crucially 
important that we provide the 
funding authorized for this program. 
Hundreds of thousands of police officers 
are counting on us. 

I am also pleased to join with Senator 
REED and others to introduce the 
Equity in Law Enforcement Act, which 
will provide parity in Federal benefits 
for law enforcement officers working in 
private educational institutions and 
for our Nation’s rail carriers. Among 
these benefits are access to grants 
under the bulletproof vest partnership, 
and survivor benefits. All of the men 
and women who serve our society as 
law enforcement officers should be 
equally entitled to all of the benefits 
the Federal Government provides, no 
matter where they serve. 

I think we can all agree that the men 
and women in law enforcement who 
have sacrificed for our safety deserve 
our deep gratitude and respect. National 
Peace Officers Memorial Day 
will offer the people of the United 
States, in their communities, in their 
State capitals, and in the Nation’s Capital, 
the opportunity to honor and reflect 
on the extraordinary service and 
sacrifice given year after year by our 
police forces. 

Our Nation’s law enforcement officers 
deserve our commitment to protect 
those who help keep us all safe. 
They are the real-life heroes; too many 
of whom too often make the ultimate 
sacrifice. It is important to support 
and respect our State and local police 
officers and all of our first responders, 
and to recognize their role in upholding 
the rule of law and keeping our Nation’s 
citizens safe and secure. During 
the week of May 13, more than 20,000 
peace officers are expected to gather in 
Washington to join with the families of 
their fallen comrades. I thank the Senate 
for joining in honoring their service 
and passing this bipartisan resolution. 


The amendment (No. 1007) was agreed 
to, as follows: 

AMENDMENT NO. 1007 
On page 2, strike the first whereas clause 
and insert: 
Whereas peace officers are on the front 
lines in protecting the schools and schoolchildren 
of the United States; 
The resolution (S. Res. 162), as 
amended, was agreed to. 
The preamble, as amended, was 
agreed to. 
The resolution, with its preamble, as 
amended, reads as follows: 

S. RES. 162 

Whereas the well-being of all citizens of 
the United States is preserved and enhanced 
as a direct result of the vigilance and dedication 
of law enforcement personnel; 

Whereas more than 900,000 men and 
women, at great risk to their personal safety, 
presently serve their fellow citizens as 
guardians of the peace; 

Whereas peace officers are on the front 
lines in protecting the schools and schoolchildren 
of the United States; 

Whereas 147 peace officers across the 
United States were killed in the line of duty 
during 2006, which is below the decade-long 
annual average of 167 deaths; 

Whereas a number of factors contributed 
to this reduction in deaths, including— 

(1) better equipment and increased use of 
bullet-resistant vests; 
(2) improved training; 
(3) longer prison terms for violent offenders; 
and 
(4) advanced emergency medical care; 
Whereas every other day, 1 out of every 16 
peace officers is assaulted, 1 out of every 56 
peace officers is injured, and 1 out of every 
5,500 peace officers is killed in the line of 
duty somewhere in the United States; and 

Whereas on May 15, 2007, more than 20,000 
peace officers are expected to gather in 
Washington, D.C., to join with the families 
of their recently fallen comrades to honor 
those comrades and all others who went before 
them: Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) recognizes May 15, 2007, as ‘‘Peace Officers 
Memorial Day’’, in honor of the Federal, 
State, and local officers that have been 
killed or disabled in the line of duty; and 
(2) calls on the people of the United States 
to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies 
and respect.

EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS 

HONORING FREDERICK COUNTY 

COMMONWEALTH ATTORNEY 

LAWRENCE AMBROGI 

HON. FRANK R. WOLF 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure 
today to recognize Frederick County Commonwealth’s 
Attorney Lawrence R. Ambrogi 
on the occasion of his retirement after nearly 
four decades of public service. 

It has come to my attention that Larry will 
not be seeking re-election in November and I 
want to take this opportunity to recognize his 
decorated career. A graduate of American 
University Law and Randolph Macon College, 
Larry was appointed as the county commonwealth 
attorney in 1969 and elected in 1971. 
As the third longest serving attorney in the history 
of the Commonwealth, Larry is highly respected 
member of the law enforcement community 
and has received numerous awards 
and recognition for his work. Larry has dedicated 
his professional life to public service and 
will be sorely missed by Frederick County and 
the Shenandoah Valley community as a 
whole. 

Larry is a man of high moral character, a 
true Virginia gentleman, family man, and loyal 
friend. I would be remiss today in didn’t also 
recognize Larry’s dedication to his wife, Carole, 
and how proud he is of their children, 
Lawrence and Elaine, and their many grandchildren. 
I suspect that as Larry prepares for 
retirement he is looking forward to spending 
more time with his family. I ask that my colleagues 
in the House rise today and join with 
me in recognizing the outstanding career of 
Lawrence Ambrogi.

RECOGNIZING MATT PIERCE FOR 
HIS SELFLESS DECISION TO 
FOREGO HIS LAST FOOTBALL 
SEASON AT OLE MISS TO ENTER 
THE ARMY 

HON. JO BONNER 

OF ALABAMA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. BONNER. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pride and pleasure that I rise to honor 
Mr. Matt Pierce, a young man from Mobile, 
Alabama, who has made the selfless decision 
to forego his final football season at Ole Miss 
in order to be commissioned as a second lieutenant 
in the United States Army. 

A former UMS-Wright football star, Matt was 
the MVP of the 2001 4A state championship 
game. As a child, he dreamed of playing football 
in the Southeastern Conference and, after 
walking on at Ole Miss and being redshirted 
his freshman year, Matt’s dream came true. In 
just his sophomore year, he started in the 
game against the University of Alabama. 

With his final football season just months 
away, Matt chose to forego his fifth season in 
order to join the Army and do ‘‘something important.’’ 


Madam Speaker, it is this type of story that 
should make us pause and give thanks to God 
that there are still young men like Matt Pierce. 
His actions personify the very best America 
has to offer. I feel certain his many friends and 
family, as well as his former teammates at 
UMS-Wright and Ole Miss, share the pride of 
a grateful Nation. 

I urge my colleagues to take a moment and 
pay tribute to Matt Pierce and his selfless devotion 
to our country and the freedom we 
enjoy. We need more people like Matt Pierce 
in this world—a true inspiration to all Americans.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF ROBERT F. HORAN, JR. 

HON. FRANK R. WOLF 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
bring the attention of the House to the retirement 
of Fairfax County chief prosecutor Robert 
F. Horan Jr. Having served 10 terms, he is 
the longest serving prosecutor in the history of 
the Commonwealth of Virginia and one of the 
very best in America. His dedicated service to 
law enforcement in northern Virginia is without 
equal. I am sure the decision to step down 
after 40 years was extremely difficult given his 
dedication to public service and to the people 
of Fairfax County. 

I have had the pleasure to call Bob my 
friend for many, many years. When Bob was 
first elected as the county’s Commonwealth’s 
attorney in 1967, he and his wife Monica 
made the decision to raise their family right 
here in northern Virginia, they have watched 
Fairfax County grow from a rural farm county 
into a bustling suburb and the most populous 
county in Virginia. Bob and Monica’s three 
boys, Robert F. Horan III, Kevin, and Timothy 
all reside locally and are a testament to their 
father’s fondness for the northern Virginia 
area. 

Bob’s accomplishments as chief prosecutor 
are legendary. He has tried and won several 
high profile cases including the 1993 sniper 
shooting at CIA headquarters as well as the 
Washington sniper case against Lee Boyd 
Malvo. Bob has received numerous awards 
and recognitions, and rightfully so. I have inserted 
for the RECORD a recent Washington 
Post article which details his unparalleled career. 


Perhaps more important than all of his 
courtroom successes is the way that Bob conducts 
himself both inside and outside of the 
courtroom. Bob is a man of the highest moral 
character, a true Virginia gentleman, a family 
man, and loyal friend. Bob is a legend in the 
law enforcement and with Bob’s retirement, an 

era is truly coming to an end in Fairfax County. 
I suspect that as Bob prepares for retirement 
he is looking forward to spending more 
time with his wife, 3 children, and grandchildren, 
T.J., Maggie, and Jennifer. We wish 
him the best and thank him for his dedicated 
service to the people. I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join with me in recognizing the 
outstanding career of Robert F. Horan, Jr.

AFTER 40 YEARS PROSECUTING CRIMES, 

RETIREMENT IS SCARY PROSPECT 

(By Tom Jackman) 

It’s hard to picture Robert F. Horan Jr. as 
a defense attorney. But there was a time, in 
the mid–1960s, when the man who would become 
Fairfax County’s chief prosecutor for 
40 years worked on the other side of the 
courtroom. 

Then, in 1966, while he was representing a 
man charged with sexual assault, the Supreme 
Court ruled that suspects must be advised 
of their rights, a precursor to the Miranda 
case. Horan argued that his client’s 
confession was illegal, a judge threw it out 
and the man ultimately was acquitted. 

‘‘Which kind of soured me on the system,’’ 
Horan said. ‘‘For the police to have taken an 
honest statement from the guy, and it gets 
thrown out, that didn’t sit well.’’ 

A year later, the chief judge of Fairfax 
asked him to be the commonwealth’s attorney. 
And he has been ever since. 

Last week, Horan (D) announced that he 
will not seek an 11th term. Horan said he 
will resign in late summer or early fall rather 
than serve out his term, clearing the way 
for his chief deputy, Raymond F. Morrogh 
(D), to run as the acting commonwealth’s attorney 
in the November general election. 

Horan agonized over his decision to step 
down when he would have been unopposed. 
He said his declining hearing has troubled 
him, particularly in whispered bench conferences, 
and he noted that he would be 75 at 
election time. 

But still, even after he decided to retire, he 
was ambivalent about leaving a job he clearly 
loves. ‘‘I’m not totally happy with it, I 
concede that,’’ he said. ‘‘My wife is happy 
with it.’’ 

His wife, Monica, also played a role in 
keeping the New Jersey native in Northern 
Virginia in the early 1960s, paving the way 
for him to become the longest-serving prosecutor 
in the state and an institution among 
prosecutors nationwide. 

After Horan graduated from Georgetown’s 
law school in 1961, he was faced with the decision 
of staying in the area or returning to 
New Jersey. But to obtain a law license in 
New Jersey, a six-month clerkship was required. 


Horan and his wife had one child and a second 
on the way. ‘‘I couldn’t afford to be a 
clerk for six months,’’ he said. ‘‘So we stayed 
in Virginia and never regretted it.’’ 

Horan spent two years as a Fairfax assistant 
prosecutor and two years in private practice. 
He was appointed the county’s top prosecutor 
in March 1967, when Ralph G. Louk 
stepped down. He faced opposition in 1967, 
1971 and 1975 but not again until 1995. And 
not since. 

In 1967, the county was still partly rural, 
with vast undeveloped stretches and some 
large cattle farms. ‘‘There were no stoplights

in Seven Corners,’’ he recalled of the now 
complicated intersection near Falls Church. 
Horan had five assistant prosecutors that 
year. Today, he has 22, still a low number 
compared with surrounding counties. 

But remarkably, ‘‘the assistants’ caseloads 
are roughly what they were when I had five,’’ 
Horan said. As the county’s population exploded 
from about 450,000 in the late 1960s to 
more than a million today, the crime rate 
has steadily fallen. Homicides now number 
between 12 and 20 annually, the same as in 
the 1970s. Burglaries and larcenies, which totaled 
24,000 in 1980, are down to about 15,000 
annually. 

Horan has a couple of theories. One is that 
older, more marginal neighborhoods such as 
Blevinstown, just outside Fairfax City, 
where local feuds tended to erupt into violence, 
have been bulldozed and replaced by 
communities of higher incomes and education. 
Another is that ambulance service is 
faster and better equipped, as are the teams 
in local emergency rooms. ‘‘Many more people 
survive gunshots now,’’ Horan said. 

One thing that hasn’t changed in Horan’s 
four decades is how he runs his office. He 
keeps the number of prosecutors to a minimum. 
He doesn’t share police reports, witness 
statements or witness lists with defense 
attorneys. And he’s not afraid to make tough 
decisions. 

‘‘His office could use many more assistant 
prosecutors,’’ said Robert C. Whitestone, an 
experienced Fairfax defense attorney. He 
said the low number of prosecutors sometimes 
keeps them too busy and pushes them 
into courtrooms unprepared. Loudoun County, 
with a population about one-fourth of 
Fairfax’s, has 16 assistant prosecutors. 

Horan said the state Compensation Board 
determines how many are allocated across 
the state and sets a starting salary of about 
$43,000, which Fairfax supplements to about 
$50,000. ‘‘Virginia does criminal prosecution 
on the cheap,’’ Horan said. 

He said that when he first took office, ‘‘it 
had become trendy to have your own investigators. 
I said I don’t believe that’s the way 
to do it,’’ and he hasn’t. Instead, he relies on 
Fairfax police. 

The officers closely follow Horan’s lead, 
guarding their information more tightly 
than virtually any other police department 
in the region, because Horan has insisted 
they not provide defense attorneys with any 
ammunition. Those who violate his instructions 
are prone to severe tongue-lashings. 

Horan said the county police force has 
maintained high standards and excellent performance 
throughout his tenure. ‘‘The Washington 
Post always wants to criticize me because 
I’ve never charged an officer with murder,’’ 
Horan said. ‘‘I’m proud of the fact they 
haven’t been charged. It means they’re doing 
their jobs.’’ 

In recent years, pickets stood outside the 
Fairfax courthouse to protest Horan’s decision 
not to charge a Prince George’s County 
officer with a fatal shooting, and the family 
of a slain Fairfax man denounced Horan’s refusal 
to charge a Fairfax officer with his 
death. But it’s nothing new to Horan. 

He cited controversial cases dating to the 
early 1970s, when an officer fatally shot a 
man in a 7-Eleven in Herndon, sparking 
riots, and another when an officer killed a 
teenage burglar. In both, there were no 
charges, to loud complaints by some. ‘‘It’s 
part of the job,’’ he said with a shrug. 

Another part of the job is successfully taking 
on a case when the county, or the world, 
is watching. No one has questioned his skill 
there, even defense attorneys. 

‘‘He’s a brilliant prosecutor,’’ Whitestone 
said. Said defense attorney Peter D. 
Greenspun: ‘‘My clients will be glad he’s not 
around to prosecute them.’’ 

U.S. Attorney General John D. Ashcroft 
chose Horan to prosecute one of the first 
sniper cases, against Lee Boyd Malvo, and 
Horan brought home a capital murder conviction 
without any witnesses identifying 
the shooter, although the jury did not impose 
the death sentence. In 1997, he obtained 
a death sentence against Mir Aimal Kasi, 
who killed two people outside the CIA in 
1993. 
Horan said his most satisfying case was 
the prosecution of Caleb D. Hughes for abducting 
5-year-old Melissa Brannen in 1989. 
Hughes was convicted of abduction with intent 
to defile; Melissa has not been found. 

‘‘That was a really tough case to try,’’ 
Horan said. ‘‘It stayed with me for a lot of 
years.’’ 

Of those that have not been solved, the one 
that bothers him the most is the death of 
Gwen Ames, 17, who was found strangled 
near Lake Anne Plaza in Reston in 1972. 

Horan noted some interesting changes in 
the courts over 40 years. The arrival of Miranda 
v. Arizona, the Supreme Court ruling 
requiring police to inform suspects of their 
rights, changed the tenor of pretrial complaints 
from police beatings to police failure 
to ‘‘Mirandize.’’ 

And the introduction of sentencing guidelines, 
giving defendants a better idea of how 
much jail time they might face, has reduced 
the amount of cases that go to trial to perhaps 
10 percent, Horan said. 

Horan reduced his own caseload from about 
20 a year, mostly homicides that he often 
began working on the day they occurred, to 
three or four annually. In recent years, with 
the increase in guilty pleas, he had no trials. 

But he clearly still loves the courtroom. 
He will handle the double-murder death penalty 
trial of Alfredo R. Prieto, set for late 
May. 

He’s leaving reluctantly. ‘‘My only fear is 
I’ve known guys who loved what they were 
doing,’’ Horan said. ‘‘They hung it up and 
they were dead in a year.’’ 

He loves playing golf; he drives a Mercedes-
Benz 240 sedan he won in a charity 
event in 2002 when he nailed a hole-in-one. 
But he doesn’t think golf can fill his time, 
and ‘‘there’s not a job in the world as interesting 
as this one.’’ 

‘‘I haven’t even given any thought to 
what’s next,’’ Horan said. ‘‘I’m sure I’ll find 
something to do.’’

RECOGNIZING HARLEM UPTOWN 
RENAISSANCE’S CONTRIBUTION 
TO THE NEW HARLEM RENAISSANCE 


HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL 

OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to enter into the RECORD an article, ‘‘Harlem’s 
Uptown Renaissance Experience,’’ published 
April 3, 2007, by the CaribNews. The article, 
written by Robert Rodney, celebrates the Uptown 
Restaurant’s contribution to the new Harlem 
Renaissance. 

During the Harlem Renaissance, also known 
as the New Negro Movement, African American 
art, literature, music, and culture came to 
the fore. Beginning sometime around 1919, 
depending on which historian you reference, 
and ending in the mid 1930s, the Harlem Renaissance 
was a time for celebrating all things 
black. Harlem, the community, provided all 
those who visited, with pulsating excitement 
and unparalleled liveliness while cultural productions 
by African Americans gained world 
wide attention while redefining blackness. 

In addition to the contributions of literary heroes 
like Zora Neale Hurston, Countee Cullen, 
and Langston Hughes; artistic achievements 
of masters like Romare Bearden, Aaron Douglass, 
and William H. Johnson; intellectuals and 
visionaries like James Weldon Johnson, 
Marcus Garvey, and Jessie Fauset, the cultural 
production of food, typically associated 
with African people throughout the Diaspora, 
was also celebrated during the Harlem Renaissance. 



May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E897 

The Uptown Renaissance Restaurant, which 
opened its doors in 2004, is quickly gaining 
recognition for its blend of authentic soul food, 
savory steaks, and hearty salads. Serving 
food that one would easily find at popular 
House-Rent Parties—where hosts would welcome 
guests into their homes in exchange for 
financial contributions that would be used to 
pay rent—the Uptown Renaissance Restaurant 
is contributing to the revitalization of 
Harlem in what most people are calling the 
New Harlem Renaissance. 

It is important to remember the past, especially 
as we continue to shape our future. I encourage 
everyone to visit the Uptown Renaissance 
Restaurant. Tell them I sent you.

HARLEM’S UPTOWN RENAISSANCE EXPERIENCE 

(By Robert Rodney) 

The Uptown Renaissance restaurant 
opened its door in April of 2004, as ‘‘the 
Ultimate Blend of Steaks, Soul Food 
and Salads’’. The restaurant boasts a 
delectably comprehensive menu from 
breakfast through dinner, where hearty 
and tasty servings are the order of the 
days and nights with customers coming 
back for more. Owners and operators of 
the Uptown Renaissance restaurant, 
the husband and wife team of Rene and 
Claudia Calliste pride themselves on an 
all-Halal meat service, a pork free environment 
complimented by healthful 
whole wheat breads as stable or accompaniments 
to respective dishes. From 
Monday through Thursday, the doors of 
Uptown Renaissance are open from 7 

a.m. to Midnight, on Friday and Saturday, 
they are open around the clock. 
The establishment astutely recognized 
the importance of their community, 
and therefore remained sensitive to its 
needs by ensuring that the clientele 
from the surrounding community continue 
to feel welcome while simultaneously 
catering to consumers from all 
areas. 
The other day I had the pleasure of 
visiting the Uptown Renaissance restaurant 
to dine and experience one of 
their specialties, the Barbecue Fish. 
Now, let me tell you this, I am a Jamaican 
and a lover of fish and I have 
consumed fish that have been prepared 
in many different ways; escoveitched, 
fried, roasted, jerked, you name it I 
have had it, but never barbecued. 

So I’ll admit that I was a little skeptical 
about having barbecue fish but I 
was pleasantly surprised by the presentation, 
the generous servings and most 
of all the taste. This meal was comprised 
of well seasoned fried breaded 
whiting covered with a nice, not too 
heavy barbecue sauce served with generous 
portions of collard greens, sweet 
yams, macaroni and cheese with corn 
bread on the side. I totally enjoyed this 
meal and now had discovered a new 
way of having my favorite fish thanks 
to Uptown Renaissance. I would definitely 
recommend this dish to all fish 
lovers. 

I also enjoyed the ambiance of the 
place, I found it to be very relaxing 
with an intimate tone. The service I 
must say was very pleasant and professional 
and the prices for the portions 
that you are served cannot be beat. 

I would encourage every one to go to 
the Uptown Renaissance and experience 
a new trend in dining. Rene, Claudia, 
Eleanor and crew are always ready 
to welcome and give you the royal 
treatment. 

The Uptown Renaissance Restaurant 
is located at 108 West 116th Street, in 
Harlem, New York.

EXPRESSING SORROW OF THE 
HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF 
THE HONORABLE JUANITA 
MILLENDER-MCDONALD, MEMBER 
OF CONGRESS FROM THE STATE 
OF CALIFORNIA 

SPEECH OF 

HON. BOBBY L. RUSH 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Monday, April 23, 2007 

Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, on Sunday 
April 22, 2007, my dear friend and colleague 
Congresswoman JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD 
was called home. 

JUANITA was a great woman who worked 
passionately for justice and cared deeply for 
mankind. She was a phenomenal Congresswoman, 
a loving wife, mother and grandmother 
and a dutiful friend. 

She made time for her constituents—and 
didn’t just listen, but heard them, and spoke 
for them. 

Madam Speaker, JUANITA began her tenure 
in Congress in 1996. She represented California’s 
37th Congressional District and was a 
proud leader in the Congressional Black Cau


cus where she championed the caucus’ disparities 
agenda to advance economic development, 
expand access and affordability for 
health care, truly ‘‘leave no child behind’’ in 
our education policy and the list goes on. 

She was a true legislator. For example, she 
authored several pieces of legislation focusing 
on health care, specifically woman’s heart 
health. Legislation such as H.R. 51, a bill to 
support National Wear Red Day, and H.R. 52 
the American Heart Month which called on 
women to take action and prevent heart disease 
were just a few examples of her legislative 
priorities. 

JUANITA was a trailblazer, becoming the first 
African American woman to chair the House 
Administration Committee for the 110th Congress. 
She was known as the Mayor of Capitol 
Hill; overseeing the operational and safety 
needs of the Capitol compound. 

She was truly a jewel and a joy to have 
known. In closing, I’m reminded of a passage 
from Proverbs 31:10–31 KJV, verse 10 which 
reads: 

‘‘Who can find a virtuous woman? . . . for 
her price is far above rubies.’’ 

Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD was 
a great woman, epitomizing humanity, humility 
and virtue. She will truly be missed.

SMALL BUSINESS LENDING 
IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2007 

SPEECH OF 

HON. DONALD A. MANZULLO 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, April 25, 2007 

The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the State of the Union had under 
consideration the bill (H.R. 1332) to improve 
the access to capital programs of the Small 
Business Administration and for other purposes: 


Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant 
opposition to the Small Business Lending 
Improvements Act of 2007. I strongly support 
the changes made in this legislation to 
the Certified Development Company Economic 
Development or 504 loan program. However, 
I have grave concerns regarding many of the 
changes made in this legislation to the other 
mainstay of the SBA’s access to credit programs: 
the 7(a) guaranteed lending program. 

Specifically, Section 101 sets the stage to 
eventually reinstate the federal loan subsidy 
for the 7(a) program later this year. This provision 
requires the Small Business Administration 
(SBA) to recalculate the subsidy rate each 
fiscal quarter so that if an appropriation is provided 
for sometime during the fiscal year, fees 
can be reduced for small business borrowers 
and lenders. While I believe this provision violates 
the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 
because it requires the re-opening of the assumptions 
that comprise the credit subsidy 
model just for the SBA’s 7(a) program as contained 
in the President’s annual budget request, 
I am more concerned about its potential 
detrimental effects upon our Nation’s small 
businesses. While I am all for lowering fees, it 
has to be done in a fiscally-responsible manner, 
particularly during these tight budgetary 
times. In short, Section 101 is unnecessary 
and will set the 7(a) program back on an unstable 
course, thus reducing its availability and 


E898 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks May 1, 2007 

attractiveness to potential small business borrowers 
and lenders. The primary association 
with the expertise on the 7(a) program the National 
Association of Government Guaranteed 
Lenders (NAGGL)—is neutral on H.R. 1332 
and has declined to take a position on the legislation. 


First, Section 101 is simply unnecessary. As 
the former chairman of the Small Business 
Committee, I never heard one complaint from 
any small business owner about the 7(a) fee 
structure. However, I heard dozens of complaints 
from small businesses when the 7(a) 
program was shut down or operated with severe 
constraints in 2002, 2003, and 2004 because 
the appropriations bill that contained the 
funding for the SBA did not pass in time. I frequently 
challenged the supporters of reinstating 
a loan subsidy for the 7(a) program to 
find me one small business that was not able 
to get a 7(a) loan because of the higher fees 
imposed after 2004. They were never able to 
produce me one example. Why is that? Because 
the so-called higher fees that went into 
effect in 2004 were at the same level as they 
were prior to 2002. What happened when the 
7(a) fees went back to the 2002 level? Despite 
many dire predictions at the time, the 7(a) program 
grew and thrived because lenders and 
borrowers knew that it would be around for the 
long-haul. The 7(a) program no longer had to 
rely on the timeliness of passing an annual 
appropriation bill. The 7(a) program now operates 
on automatic pilot similar to how the 
other main access to credit programs at the 
SBA—the 504 and the Small Business Investment 
Company (SBIC) programs—that also 
receive no annual subsidy and operates totally 
on user fees. October 1st—the beginning of 
the new federal fiscal year—is no longer is a 
day of anxiety and worry for small business 
borrowers and lenders. 

Second, Section 101 will set the 7(a) program 
back on a path of instability. Unfortunately, 
this is a very technical and arcane debate 
where numbers and statistics are thrown 
around very casually. Some argue that H.R. 
1332 will reduce fees up to $50,000 to small 
business borrowers. But then in the next 
breath, they argue that this bill will not modify 
the subsidy rate. Both cannot be true. It’s important 
to remember that the main goal of the 
Democratic proponents of this legislation is to 
reinstate the loan subsidy for the 7(a) program. 
That’s why the Congressional Budget 
Office (CBO) estimated that Section 101 will 
increase spending by $305 million in Fiscal 
Year 2008 and $2.265 billion over the next 
five years. Keep in mind, Mr. Chairman, that 
the President requested only $464 million in 
spending on the entire SBA in FY ’08. If fully 
implemented, this bill would almost double the 
spending on the SBA in one year! 

The Democratic supporters of this legislation 
also wish to duplicate the 7(a) fee structure as 
it was in place between 2002 and 2004 in 
which there was a federal loan subsidy of approximately 
$100 million each year for a 7(a) 
program level of under $9.5 billion. However, 
there were only three fees temporarily reduced 
during this time period as part of an economic 
stimulus package in the aftermath of the terrorist 
attacks of September 11, 2001. Just like 
other economic stimulus measures, such as 
the 50 percent bonus tax depreciation, these 
7(a) fee reductions were intended to only remain 
in place a short while until the economy 
got back on track. They were never intended 
to become part of permanent law. 

The upfront 7(a) borrower fee was temporarily 
reduced from 2 percent to 1 percent for 
small businesses seeking smaller 7(a) loans of 
under $150,000. For 7(a) loans between 
$150,000 and $700,000, the upfront fee was 
temporarily reduced from 3 percent to 2.5 percent. 
The 3.5 percent upfront fee on 7(a) 
loans from $700,000 to $1 million, which was 
the maximum loan guarantee limit at the time, 
was not reduced at all during the 2002 to 
2004 time period. However, the annual on-
going fee changed to lenders on the remaining 
outstanding balance on a 7(a) loan was also 
temporarily cut in half from 0.50 percent to 

0.25 percent. Thus, at most, a fee structure 
that temporarily existed between 2002 and 
2004 produced a maximum savings of $3,500 
to a small business seeking to borrow 
$700,000. For a small business borrower 
seeking a loan of $150,000, the maximum 
savings was $1,500. Both figures are a far cry 
from $50,000. 
It is also important to remember that the upfront 
fee is rolled into the overall loan and amortized 
over the life-time of the loan. In other 
words, a borrower is not forced to come up 
with the entire upfront fee at closing. For the 
average small business 7(a) borrower, the fee 
change in 2004 only amounted to an increased 
payment of $10 per month. Thus, in 
return for an extra $10 per month, small business 
borrowers and lenders no longer have to 
worry about the 7(a) program ending or operating 
with various restrictions. However, if the 
7(a) program is put back in the appropriations 
process, then there will be uncertainty if the 
program will be around for the long-term. Section 
101 also allows 7(a) fees to fluctuate 
every few months depending upon whether or 
not Congress adds or subtracts money for a 
loan subsidy; thus harming long-term planning. 
This policy change also sets the precedent to 
reinstate the loan subsidies for the 504 and 
SBIC programs, which is the long-term goal of 
the Democratic proponents of this legislation. 

I’m also concerned that at a time when we 
should be streamlining government, H.R. 1332 
creates three new lending programs at the 
SBA and makes one pilot program permanent. 
While I am sympathetic to the need to increase 
lending to rural areas, help health care 
professionals to open up shop in medically underserved 
areas, and assist veterans and reservists, 
the initiatives contained in Sections 
102 through 105 of H.R. 1332 fundamentally 
undermine the ‘‘zero’’ loan subsidy policy in 
the 7(a) program. To fully implement these 
provisions, Congress will be forced to choose 
between higher fees for all other small business 
borrowers or an even higher appropriation 
to subsidize these new programs. Knowing 
the perspective of the Democratic proponents 
of this legislation who fundamentally 
disagree with ‘‘zero subsidy,’’ these initiatives 
will put further pressure on Congress to reinstate 
an appropriation for the 7(a) loan subsidy. 
CBO estimated that these three specific 
proposals will cost the taxpayer $11 million in 
2008 and $77 million over the next five years. 
These provisions also set the precedent for 
other well-deserving groups to request Congress 
at a later date to eliminate 7(a) fees for 
them and provide their group with a much 
higher 90 percent guarantee rate on 7(a) 
loans, further exposing precious taxpayer 
money to higher risk of default and loss. It will 
be very hard for a future Congress to say no 
to these groups once these precedents have 

been set in this bill. I enclose for the RECORD 
a copy of the Administration’s position on H.R. 
1332, which reflects many of my same concerns 
listed above. 

I am proud over what Republicans on the 
Small Business Committee were able to accomplish 
over the last 12 years to promote fiscal 
responsibility at the SBA while at the same 
time helping a record number of small businesses. 
When Republicans were given stewardship 
of Congress in 1995, Congress spent 
$213 million of the taxpayer’s hard-earned 
money on the SBA to support a 7(a) and 504 
loan program volume of $8.3 billion to reach 
55,800 small business borrowers. In 2006, the 
SBA doubled that level of assistance to reach 
over 100,000 small business borrowers with a 
7(a) and 504 loan program usage level of 
$19.1 billion—all at no direct cost to the taxpayer. 
We should not return to the pre-1995 
days just to satisfy a philosophical desire to 
restore loan subsidy, particularly for a program 
that doesn’t need it. The old adage applies 
here—if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Again, 
NAGGL has not taken a position on this bill. 
In short, Mr. Chairman, the 7(a) program ain’t 
broke and the ‘‘cure’’ in Title I of H.R. 1332 is 
worse than the ‘‘disease.’’ I urge my colleagues 
on both sides of Capitol Hill to oppose 
this well-meaning but misguided legislation. 

April 24, 2007. 

STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 

H.R. 1332—SMALL BUSINESS LENDING 
IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2007 
The Administration has achieved significant 
results in expanding the availability of 
credit to small businesses. Between fiscal 
years 2001 and 2006, the Small Business Administration 
(SBA) has more than doubled 
the total number of guaranteed loans to 
small businesses under the Section 7(a) and 
Section 504 loan programs. SBA has achieved 
this growth while reducing program costs 
and taxpayer-provided subsidies. H.R. 1332 
could potentially reverse this success by reintroducing 
or increasing taxpayer-funded 
subsidies for small business loan programs. 
The Administration therefore cannot support 
House passage of H.R. 1332 unless it is 
amended to delete provisions that would increase 
these subsidies and the need for appropriations 
and/or increased fees on other 
loan applicants. 

The Administration also opposes provisions 
in the bill that would: (1) duplicate 
rural lending activities currently performed 
by the Department of Agriculture; (2) have 
SBA refinance private debt, as Federally-
backed credit should not supplant private 
loans; and (3) raise constitutional questions 
by establishing race or gender-based preferences 
without presenting a strong basis in 
evidence that these preferences meet constitutional, 
standards. The Administration 
urges Congress to strike these provisions.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FREEDOM 
TO BANK ACT 

HON. RON PAUL 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. PAUL. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
introduce legislation repealing two unconstitutional 
and paternalistic Federal financial regulations. 
First, this legislation repeals a Federal 
regulation that limits the number of withdrawals 
someone can make from a savings 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E899 

account in a month’s time without being assessed 
financial penalties. As hard as it is to 
believe, the Federal Government actually 
forces banks to punish people for accessing 
their own savings too many times in a month. 
This bill also repeals a regulation that requires 
bank customers to receive a written monthly financial 
statement from their banks, regardless 
of whether the customer wants such a communication. 


These regulations exceed Congress’s constitutional 
powers and violate individual property 
and contract rights. Furthermore, these 
regulations insult Americans by treating them 
as children who are unable to manage their 
own affairs without Federal control. I urge my 
colleagues to show their respect for the Constitution 
and the American people by cosponsoring 
this legislation.

TRIBUTE TO VETERAN CONGRESSIONAL 
AIDE JUDITH BREWER 

HON. JOHN M. McHUGH 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. MCHUGH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor my Legislative Director, Judith Brewer, 
for her 34 years of excellent service as a 
Congressional staff member and to wish her 
well upon her retirement. I also wish to thank 
her for the 26 years she served the citizens of 
northern New York, 14 of which were as a 
member of my staff. 

After graduating from the University of 
Maine cum laude with a B.A. in political 
science, Judi began her career in 1973 when 
she joined Congressman Fred B. Rooney’s 
staff as a Staff Assistant. Five years later, she 
joined the House Select Committee on Aging’s 
Subcommittee on Retirement Income and Employment, 
where she served as a liaison between 
the subcommittee chairman, older 
Americans, and Federal agencies. Judi next 
served as Projects Assistant in Congressman 
Harold T. Johnson’s office. 

Judi began serving the people of northern 
New York in 1981 when she became a Legislative 
Assistant in my predecessor, Congressman 
David O’B. Martin’s office. In that capacity, 
Judi developed significant expertise in policy 
areas of great importance to northern New 
York, including dairy, education, health care, 
and labor. 

When I came to Congress in 1993, I was 
fortunate that Judi decided to continue her excellent 
service to the people of northern New 
York as a member of my staff. For the past 14 
years, they, as well as I, have been the beneficiary 
of Judi’s compassion, dedication, expertise, 
kindness, humor, and professionalism. 
Accordingly, I profoundly thank Judi and wish 
her the very best as she enters retirement.

HONORING KATHERINE CARNEY 

HON. TOM DAVIS 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Katherine Carney 
upon receiving the Commonwealth Academy’s 
Recognition for Educators, CARE, Award. 

The CARE award honors outstanding educators 
from across the United States for their 
unrelenting work to enhance the lives of their 
students. Kathe, a teacher at Neabsco Elementary 
School, is honored for her work in 
promoting diverse learners in the spirit of the 
’’No Child Left Behind Act.’’ 

Although she began her career teaching 
English literature, Mrs. Carney’s passion and 
gift lay with teaching the neediest students. In 
1994, at PACE West, a self-contained special 
education school, she taught students with serious 
emotional and behavioral needs. In addition 
to the 8–13 subjects she taught a day, 
she took on roles as a mentor, advisory committee 
member, and the school’s administrator 
of various special education testing regimens. 
Devoted to reading, Mrs. Carney noted a void 
of books at her school, and was shocked to 
find no library at PACE West. She took it upon 
herself to initiate, organize, and develop the 
PACE West library, which housed 2,000 volumes 
upon her departure. 

After 7 years at PACE, Mrs. Carney joined 
the staff at Swans Creek Elementary School. 
She taught a self-contained class for students 
in the 2nd–5th grade with learning disabilities, 
speech, language and vision impairments, and 
other health challenges. Again, Mrs. Carney 
mentored her fellow teachers and established 
the school’s Learning Disabilities Program. 

In 2003, Mrs. Carney joined the faculty at 
Neabsco Elementary School, teaching 4th and 
5th graders who are emotionally disturbed. 
The administration at Neabsco quickly realized 
her abilities and tasked her to be the case 
manager of the Instructional Consultant Team 
and a member of the Child Study Team. Mrs. 
Carney has received numerous commendations 
at Neabsco, including being named 2007 
Neabsco Teacher of the Year and was nominated 
to be 2007 Dale City Teacher of the 
Year. 

Over her distinguished career, Mrs. Carney 
has demonstrated great resolve, patience, and 
a unique ability to make a positive difference 
in the lives of her students. Working with students 
with these needs is trying; however, 
every day is a new opportunity for Mrs. Carney 
and her students. No incident or past history 
is ever carried back into the classroom; 
this includes the time where an inadvertent 
swing of a baseball bat left her in a full leg 
cast for months. 

It is dark when Mrs. Carney arrives at 
school and dark when she leaves. Her devotion 
to her students is immeasurable. Whether 
it is tutoring for the science fair on a Saturday, 
meeting with a concerned parent late at night, 
or counseling former students on life altering 
decisions, Mrs. Carney always makes herself 
available to those in need. Through her tender 
approach and no-nonsense outlook, Mrs. Carney 
has made a difference in the lives of 
countless youths in Prince William County. 

Madam Speaker, in closing, I would like to 
commend and congratulate Mrs. Carney for 
being recognized as one of the 2007 CARE 
awardees. I call upon my colleagues to join 
me in applauding Kathe on all her accomplishments 
and in wishing her continued success in 
the years to come. 

TRIBUTE TO THE 50TH ANNIVER


SARY OF THE REPUBLIC OF 

GHANA 

HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of the 50th anniversary of the independence 
of the Republic of Ghana. On 
March 6, 1957, Ghana became the first country 
in Africa south of the Sahara to gain independence 
from colonial rule. The theme for 
the anniversary is: Championing African Excellence. 
There are three main objectives for the 
jubilee celebrations, which are: celebrate and 
commemorate Ghana’s landmark achievement 
as the first country in Black Africa to attain 
independence from colonial rule; reflect on the 
evolution, development, achievements and 
drawbacks of the country over the past 50 
years; and to look forward to the future vision 
of excellence in all fields of endeavor in the 
next 50 years towards the centennial anniversary 
of the nation. 

Year-long activities marking the Golden Jubilee 
have been scheduled, beginning in January 
2007 and ending in December 2007, with 
monthly themes including: Reflection, African 
Unity, and Heroes of Ghana. April’s theme is 
‘‘Our Nation, Our People,’’ and I would like to 
enter into the RECORD this article, regarding 
another ‘‘first’’ for Ghana, reported by BBC 
News International on April 24, 2007, entitled 
‘‘La Scala Brings Beethoven to Ghana.’’ It details 
the recent visit to Ghana by Milan’s La 
Scala orchestra and chorus and speaks about 
the hopes of expanding the appreciation of 
classical music to other countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa. 

The Republic of Ghana continues to experience 
economic growth and the government 
continues to work on improving the energy 
generating capacity of the country. Recently 
an Educational Reform Program has been implemented, 
which primary vision is to align 
education to national aspirations to develop 
disciplined, socially conscious and well-rounded 
Ghanaians who can hold their own as global 
citizens anywhere. All these efforts promise 
that Ghana will reach its goal of excellence in 
all fields as they look towards the centennial 
anniversary. I urge fellow members to continue 
to support Ghana’s independence by 
working towards victory over poverty, disease, 
gender in equality, and lack of education. 

LA SCALA BRINGS BEETHOVEN TO GHANA 
(By David Willey) 
Italy’s famous La Scala orchestra has 
played in sub-Saharan Africa for the first 
time. 
The venue: Accra’s 1,400 seat ultra-modern 
National Theatre. 
The occasion: celebrations marking the 
50th anniversary of Ghana’s independence. 
The cast: Daniel Barenboim and 160 members 
of the orchestra and chorus of Milan’s 
La Scala. 
The programme: Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, 
the Choral, whose Ode to Joy has become 
the official anthem of the European 
Union. 
ELECTRIC 
The evening began in an unusual way, with 
the beating of a traditional tribal drum, a 
traditional Ghanaian welcome. 
It ended with a standing ovation for the 
prestigious orchestra and their equally famous 
conductor. 


E900 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks May 1, 2007 

A member of the Ghanaian organising 
committee told me he remembered having 
music appreciation lessons at school 50 years 
ago, when Ghana was still a British colony, 
but he could not remember any similar event 
in his lifetime. 

Most of the audience were invited to attend, 
with the few hundred tickets actually 
put on sale costing between US $30–50, well 
beyond the reach of the pockets of the average 
Ghanaian. 

In sub-Saharan Africa, 60 per cent of people 
live on less than two US dollars per day. So, 
unsurprisingly, the auditorium was packed 
with local officials and diplomats. 

A quick trawl around Accra’s teeming 
markets confirmed earlier suspicions—that 
the Ghanaian capital completely lacks CD 
shops selling classical music. 

While African faces on the crowded stage 
were limited to two, one the African-American 
bass-baritone Kevin Deas, and the 
other, the soprano Measha Brueggergosman, 
a Canadian national. 

The impact of the music on those lucky 
enough to be present was, however, electric. 

Daniel Barenboim, the musicians and the 
four soloists (who included La Scala newcomer 
and rising British star, tenor Ian 
Storey) gave their all. They had time for 
only a single rehearsal, but their performance 
was impeccable. 

Barenboim told me during rehearsal: ‘‘The 
problem is, you cannot articulate the content 
of music in words. This can only be expressed 
through sound. This is what I hope 
we are bringing to them.’’ 

This extraordinary event was the result of 
a casual invitation to Daniel Barenboim in 
New York last December by Ghana’s highest-
profile international figure, Kofi Annan, 
former UN Secretary General and a friend of 
La Scala’s new ‘‘maestro’’ conductor. 

The president of Italy, Giorgio Napolitano, 
and the Mayor of Milan, Letizia Moratti, 
also helped to make Kofi Annan’s dream 
come true. 

SPIRITED RENDITION 
Annan was beaming afterwards at the Ghanaian 
President’s post-concert party in Accra’s 
State Banqueting Hall. 
‘‘In international affairs, you have to learn 
how to create pillars and foundations in 
order to realise dreams,’’ he said. 
At the post-concert party some of La 
Scala’s violin players playfully took over 
from a local Accra orchestra, giving a spirited 
rendition of Guantanamara. 
But was it really worth the vast expense 
($500,000) to charter an Airbus and fly this 
huge and talented company 6,000 miles 
across the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara 
desert to Ghana, and back, for a single 
Beethoven performance? 
Barenboim says emphatically ‘‘yes’’. He 
would like to return to Africa, either with 
La Scala or to give a series of solo piano recitals 
in various African countries. 
The former child prodigy, who has replaced 
Riccardo Muti as conductor at La Scala, and 
who built up the now famous West-East 
Divan orchestra of Israeli and Palestinian 
musicians, believes music may hold the key 
to bridging the North-South cultural, and 
even economic, divide. 
‘‘You have to listen to the other players if 
you want to play in an orchestra,’’ he said. 
But as one of the first violins in the orchestra 
whispered to me as we were flying 
back high over the Sahara desert, while she 
had enjoyed this unique experience, she was 
not so sure that a charity concert in Milan 
to raise money for Ghana might not have 
been preferable. 
The audience shouted for more after the 
Accra concert, but a performance of this 
quality of Beethoven’s Ninth hardly lends 
itself to an encore. 

Now we shall have to see whether Daniel 
Barenboim’s ambitious dream of stimulating 
a demand for classical music in Africa is 
going to be fulfilled. 

It will require a lot of money, and a lot of 
politics. The encore is not yet assured.

TRIBUTE TO MR. RONALD CALERY 

HON. BART STUPAK 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. STUPAK. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor a constituent and friend of mine, Mr. 
Ronald Calery, who has spent a lifetime fighting 
poverty, serving as a voice for those least 
fortunate and defending the powerless in our 
society. This week, Mr. Calery will be recognized 
for his efforts with the prestigious Terrence 
DuVernay Award, which recognizes career 
excellence in the field of affordable housing. 


Mr. Calery has served for 35 years as Executive 
Director with the Chippewa-Luce-Mackinac 
Community Action Human Resources Authority 
(CAHRA) Inc. Before his appointment 
to the position of Executive Director, he 
served the agency as a founding member of 
the board of directors. The Chippewa-Luce-
Mackinac CAHRA administers a number of 
critical programs that attack poverty head on. 
Among its vital services, the organization provides 
quality housing that is affordable to low 
income and moderate income persons. 

Ron Calery’s leadership of the Chippewa-
Luce-Mackinac Community Action Human Resources 
Authority has strengthened this organization, 
making it one of the most effective 
community action agencies in the state. Under 
his leadership, the Chippewa-Luce-Mackinac 
Community Action Agency has assisted local 
entities to improve existing housing and develop 
new housing units. 

Perhaps one of Mr. Calery’s most notable 
contributions was the construction of Avery 
Square Complex, a project that served to help 
revitalize downtown Sault Ste. Marie. The 
project has been widely recognized as a housing 
model throughout the State of Michigan. 
Mr. Calery has also worked closely with county 
and local governments, helping to spur the 
construction of moderate cost housing in several 
rural communities. He planned a housing 
development in Sault Ste. Marie, and is currently 
planning moderate cost housing in St. 
Ignace. 

While the Duvernay award which Mr. Calery 
will receive focuses upon efforts to provide affordable 
housing, Mr. Calery’s service to the 
public, the Eastern Upper Peninsula (V.P.) 
and the State of Michigan extends well beyond 
affordable housing issues. His service to 
the state and his community has been extensive. 


At one time or another, he has been a driving 
force in just about every organization that 
plays a positive role in the Eastern U.P. He 
served on the Tri-County Small Business Loan 
Committee, helping to spur small business in 
Chippewa, Luce and Mackinac Counties. As 
President of the John F. Kennedy Chippewa 
County Retarded Children’s Association, he 
helped to expand activities and programs for 
handicapped children. He served on the State 
board of directors for the Michigan Association 
for Retarded Children. He spent 4 years in a 

non-partisan position as an elected City Commissioner 
for Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. As 
the Chairman of the Tri-County Recreation 
Commission and the Sault Ste. Marie Parks 
and Recreation Commission, he helped ensure 
that positive recreation opportunities 
abound in the Sault Ste. Marie region. He also 
coached Soo PeeWee Hockey. 

No matter what project Mr. Calery takes on, 
he never takes ‘‘no’’ for an answer. He never 
retreats from a challenge. Instead, Ron Calery 
is known for pausing, examining the various 
obstacles, assembling a new coalition, seeking 
different funding arrangements, and ultimately 
finding a solution to achieve the goal. Regardless 
of what it takes, once he decides that a 
project or program can have a positive impact 
on his fellow citizens, he is relentless in seeing 
the project brought to fruition. The affordable 
housing projects, programs to eliminate 
poverty, and efforts to improve the living conditions 
for-residents of Michigan have all been 
challenging, but never once has Ron Calery 
shirked from the challenge. 

When a project he has worked upon is complete 
or a program is successful, this humble 
man does not leap forward to take credit. Instead, 
Mr. Calery always steps aside to commend 
the work of others and compliment the 
fine leadership they have provided. 

On Tuesday, May 1, 2007, Mr. Calery will 
be recognized by his colleagues for a career 
spent helping others. His many friends will 
gather to say thank you for all that Ron Calery 
has accomplished. Across Michigan, many 
other citizens will be unable to attend, but 
they, too, will be thanking this warm man for 
his many kindnesses. Madam Speaker, as 
Ron Calery receives this well-deserved award, 
I would ask that you and the entire U.S. 
House of Representatives join me in saluting, 
congratulating, and thanking him for his selfless 
service to others.

INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION 
AMENDING STATUTE ESTABLISHING 
EISENHOWER MEMORIAL 
COMMISSION 

HON. DENNIS MOORE 

OF KANSAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. MOORE of Kansas. Madam Speaker, 
joined by Representatives JERRY MORAN, 
THORNBERRY, BOSWELL, TIAHRT and BOYDA, I 
am today introducing legislation which would 
make a variety of technical changes to the 
statute establishing the Eisenhower Memorial 
Commission. 

The Eisenhower Memorial Commission was 
created by the U.S. Congress in 1999 as a 
bipartian commission for the purpose of considering 
and formulating plans for the location, 
design and construction of a permanent memorial 
to Dwight D. Eisenhower to perpetuate 
his memory and his contributions to the United 
States. Since being fully appointed in 2001, 
the Commission considered 26 different sites 
in the District of Columbia. In 2005, it selected 
a site between the Department of Education 
and the National Air and Space Museum, two 
institutions resulting from and greatly influenced 
by President Eisenhower’s leadership. 
In 2006, Congress approved the memorial’s 
location within Area I, in compliance with the 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E901 

Commemorative Works Act. The Commission 
secured full approval for the selected site following 
extensive review by the National Park 
Service, the National Capital Memorial Advisory 
Commission, the National Capital Planning 
Commission, and the Commission of Fine 
Arts. 

Since its inception, the Commission has 
also taken great care to study and analyze the 
Eisenhower legacy. It produced a report by 
leading scholars and experts on Eisenhower 
that provides a definitive statement on the 
transcending elements of Eisenhower’s enduring 
legacy. He ranks as one of the preeminent 
figures in the global history of the 20th century. 
Dwight Eisenhower spent his entire life in 
public service. His most well-known contributions 
include serving as Supreme Commander 
of the Allied Expeditionary Forces in World 
War II and as 34th President of the United 
States, but Eisenhower also served as the first 
commander of NATO and as President of Columbia 
University. Dramatic changes occurred 
in America during his lifetime, many of which 
he participated in and influenced through his 
extraordinary leadership as President. Although 
Ike grew up before automobiles existed, 
he created the Interstate Highway System 
and took America into space. He created 
NASA, the Department of Health, Education, 
and Welfare, and the Federal Aviation Administration. 
He added Hawaii and Alaska to the 
United States and ended the Korean War. 
President Eisenhower desegregated the District 
of Columbia and sent federal troops into 
Little Rock, AR to enforce school integration. 
He diffused international crises and inaugurated 
the national security policies that guided 
the nation for the next three decades, leading 
to the peaceful end of the Cold War. A career 
soldier, Eisenhower championed peace, freedom, 
justice and security, and as President he 
stressed the interdependence of those goals. 
He spent a lifetime fulfilling his duty to his 
country, always remembering to ask what’s 
best for America. 

Eisenhower’s legacy provides hope to all of 
us—like him, through education and public 
service, we as a Nation and individually can 
rise to meet any challenge. The Eisenhower 
Memorial Commission now needs to move 
into the design phase. As design begins, the 
Commission’s organization, specifically with 
regard to contracting and staffing, needs to be 
updated and revised to enable efficient management 
and responsible stewardship. This 
legislation provides for the necessary reorganization. 
The legislation enables the Commission 
to retain the services of full, part-time, 
and volunteer staff as government employees, 
without the restrictions of the competitive service 
requirements. It also provides the authority 
for the Commission’s Executive Architect to 
manage technical and administrative aspects 
of design and construction. It provides for staff 
to be released on the completion of the memorial 
and enables the Commission to work in 
collaboration with federal agencies. In addition, 
the legislation will allow the Commission 
to receive direct appropriations, easing the 
burden on both the Commission and federal 
agencies that previously served as conduits 
for Commission funding. I have also enclosed 
a detailed justification of the proposed legislation 
for your review. 

Very similar legislation, S. 890, has been introduced 
by Senator DANIEL INOUYE of Hawaii, 
who serves with me and Senator TED STE


VENS on the Executive Committee of the Eisenhower 
Memorial Commission. I am joined 
today in introducing this measure by Representatives 
JERRY MORAN, THORNBERRY and 
BOSWELL, who serve as members of the Eisenhower 
Memorial Commission, and by our 
fellow Kansans serving in the U.S. House, 
Representatives TIAHRT and BOYDA.

A TRIBUTE TO TAIWANESE 
PRESIDENT CHEN SHUI-BIAN 

HON. THOMAS G. TANCREDO 

OF COLORADO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. TANCREDO. Madam Speaker, Taiwan 
President Chen Shui-Bian recently announced 
that his country plans to pursue full membership 
in the World Health Organization. I wish 
President Chen and the 23 million people of 
Taiwan the best of luck in this endeavor, and 
I hope that all Americans will support their effort. 


Taiwan has a modern, world-class health 
care system and has lent its talents and resources 
in the field to people around the 
world. Taiwan’s expertise and contributions to 
world health are particularly important at this 
time when people, products, and threats to 
health and safety can travel great distances in 
relatively short periods of time. 

The WHO’s mission is ‘‘. . . the attainment 
by all peoples of the highest possible level of 
health.’’ Providing accurate information about 
the spread of health threats is a critical part of 
that mission. 

Last year, however, the WHO disseminated 
an inaccurate map which classified Taiwan as 
an area affected with human cases of the bird 
flu—even though no cases had been documented 
on the island. Unfortunately, because 
the WHO—like many organizations pretends 
that Taiwan is a part of China, the WHO depicted 
Taiwan as an ‘‘infected area’’ because 
there had been an avian flu outbreak on the 
Chinese mainland. This is not only unfair, it is 
dangerous. 

Madam Speaker, I am sure that the intent of 
the WHO is not to knowingly disseminate false 
information about such a dangerous health 
threat—yet because of Chinese pressure to 
exclude Taiwan from this body, that is exactly 
what happened. And unfortunately, unless the 
problem of Taiwan’s exclusion from this body 
is remedied, this could easily happen again. 

When China and the WHO play politics with 
people’s health, it isn’t just dangerous for Taiwan, 
it is ‘‘bad medicine’’ for the whole world. 
I hope that the Administration recognizes this 
fact, and I hope they will actively support Taiwan’s 
bid for full membership in this world 
body.

IN RECOGNITION OF NICK NEMETH 

HON. THOMAS G. TANCREDO 

OF COLORADO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. TANCREDO. Madam Speaker, today I 
am honored to recognize Nick Nemeth of 
Chapparal High School in Parker, Colorado. 
As a sophomore, Mr. Nemeth received an invi


tation to attend a 10-day National Young 
Leaders Conference this summer in Washington, 
DC. 

Mr. Nemeth has demonstrated outstanding 
academic and leadership qualities as a young 
man, and is an archetype of his school and 
community. Completing the academic school 
year first in his class, he was chosen as a National 
Scholar, an honor presented to less 
than one percent of all qualified high-school 
students. 

Students chosen to attend the National 
Young Leaders Conference are hand selected 
based on both their academic achievement 
and recommendations by educators, mentors, 
and community leaders. 

The National Young Leaders Conference is 
a forum for promising youth designed to inspire 
and foster their full leadership potential. 
Supported by over 400 members from the 

U.S. Congress, this program provides young 
men and women a rare opportunity to gain an 
insider’s perspective into the legislative and 
political process of Washington D.C. This 
unique interaction and exposure enables them 
to formulate valuable perspectives which will 
help them guide their communities into the future. 
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to 
acknowledge one of Colorado’s own as one of 
America’s young leaders. Please join me in 
congratulating Mr. Nemeth and wishing him 
well in his future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING MRS. VAUGHAN 
INGE MORRISSETTE FOR HER 
SIGNIFICANT PHILANTHROPIC 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CITY OF 
MOBILE AND THE STATE OF 
ALABAMA 

HON. JO BONNER 

OF ALABAMA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. BONNER. Madam Speaker, in life, there 
are givers and there are takers, and it is with 
personal pride and pleasure that I recognize 
someone who is always giving and always 
doing for others, Mobile’s own, Vaughan Inge 
Morrissette. In this vein, I rise today to salute 
Vaughan and offer her our heartfelt thanks on 
behalf of the people of south Alabama for a 
lifetime of exemplary philanthropic service to 
both the city of Mobile and the state of Alabama. 


For some 40 years, Vaughan has dedicated 
a considerable amount of her time toward the 
advancement of education, the arts, and history 
by serving as trustee, board member, and 
even as chairman of numerous organizations 
in the state and throughout the nation. 

Shortly after graduating from Sweet Briar 
College in Virginia in 1954, Vaughan began to 
make a name for herself in the all-important 
area of volunteerism. Ironically, it was some 
forty years later than Vaughan would be 
named to the board of directors of her alma 
mater. She served Sweet Briar in this capacity 
from 1996–2002. 

In 1973, Vaughan became a member of the 
Colonial Dames, serving on the Conde Charlotte 
Museum House Committee, trustee for 
the friends of Sulgrave Manor, center head, 
state president, and national board member. 
She currently serves on the Dumbarton House 


E902 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks May 1, 2007 

Fund for the Future and is actively involved in 
the Colonial Dames’ Vision Committee, a national 
committee designed to help state societies 
emulate the success of Alabama’s. From 
1987 until 1996, she served as trustee for 
Washington and Lee University in Virginia, 
and has also served on the board of directors 
for Spring Hill College in Mobile. 

With an obvious desire to help others, 
Vaughan has served in similar capacities as 
chairman of Mobile Infirmary Medical Center, 
president of the Junior League of Mobile, and 
as a vestry member of St. Paul’s Episcopal 
Church. 

While her family obviously comes first, 
Vaughan has a genuine love for Mobile where 
she currently serves as board chairman of 
both the Mobile Museum of Art and the Alabama 
School of Math and Science Foundation. 
She also serves on the board of directors 
for the Alabama Archives and History Foundation, 
American Village and Citizenship Trust, 
Alabama Department of Archives and History, 
and as trustee of the Carnival Museum in Mobile. 
She is also trustee for the Alabama Institute 
of the Deaf and Blind Foundation and director 
of the Alabama Arts Council. 

Madam Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, 
Vaughan’s involvement is not just at the local 
and state level, but at the national level as 
well. 

For years she has represented the state of 
Alabama on the Mount Vernon Ladies Association 
of the Union, a prestigious group which 
bears the responsibility for maintaining and 
preserving President George Washington’s 
home at Mount Vernon. Through their network 
of contacts throughout the country, as well as 
their considerable efforts, funds are raised privately 
so that Mount Vernon continues to be 
completely maintained without the help of taxpayer 
dollars. Vaughan served as regent of 
the Mount Vernon Ladies Association of the 
Union from 1994–1997. 

She has also included a stint on the board 
of directors for AmSouth Bank. 

Madam Speaker, Vaughan Morrissette has 
dedicated practically her entire life to the service 
of others in south Alabama, all-the-while 
being a devoted wife, mother to four children, 
and grandmother to 11 wonderful grandchildren. 


When her husband, the late H. Taylor 
Morrissette, passed away in 1990, Vaughan 
picked up the mantle and has, more times 
than one can count, made her beautiful home 
available to entertain visiting dignitaries and 
others who were looking to make Mobile and 
south Alabama home. In many ways, she has 
been a one-person chamber of commerce, always 
promoting Mobile, always speaking positively 
about where our community is going. It 
is very safe to say that Vaughan is always 
looking forward with confidence that Mobile’s 
best days are ahead. 

Madam Speaker, as I said at the beginning 
of this tribute, some people in life are givers; 
others are takers. Make no mistake, Vaughan 
Inge Morrissette has spent practically her entire 
life giving, and I ask my colleagues to join 
with me in thanking Vaughan for her commitment 
to so many wonderful philanthropic missions. 


I know her family and her many friends join 
with me in praising her many accomplishments. 
On behalf of all who have benefited 
from her good heart and generous spirit, permit 
me to extend thanks for her many efforts 

over the past four decades in making Mobile 
and south Alabama a better place to live and 
work.

HONORING CHERYL A. WUENSCH 

HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER 

OF MARYLAND 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise before you today to honor Cheryl A. 
Wuensch, in celebration of her ordination as a 
Methodist Minister in the Baltimore Washington 
Conference of the United Methodist 
Church on May 26, 2007. 

Nearly 20 years ago, she wrote on a scholarship 
application: ‘‘the first time my heart 
heard the Gospel was in her classroom.’’ To 
some degree, that statement was true. While 
she was very active in high school youth 
group, she did not begin the process of owning 
a mature faith in Christ until she attended 
an undergraduate university. Cheryl double 
majored in political science and religion, with 
a vague interest in attending law school and a 
burning desire to immerse herself in the life, 
teachings, and world of Jesus. Ultimately, she 
felt the Spirit’s call to pursue a vocation of 
teaching, seeking advanced degrees in the 
New Testament at Yale and Princeton. Cheryl 
taught various courses in the New Testament 
and related areas at Princeton Theological 
Seminary and at Lancaster Theological Seminary 
for several years. 

Cheryl has spent the past 9 years at 
Timonium United Methodist Church, 2 years 
as program director and 7 years as Associate 
Pastor. Her primary areas of spiritual 
giftedness are in teaching and preaching, 
leading worship, shepherding, and outreach/ 
evangelism. One of her fundamental philosophies 
is to equip others for ministry based 
upon their own giftedness. 

Cheryl fervently believes that the Gospel 
can be embodied in new and lifechanging 
ways through outreach oriented mission activities. 
She led several trips to Appalachia with 
approximately 40 youth and adult volunteers. 
She participated in a trip to Costa Rica with a 
group from the Baltimore North District. 
Timonium United Methodist Church continues 
to be active in two soup kitchens in Baltimore 
City and sponsored a Habitat House for 11 
consecutive years. Over the years, Cheryl focused 
a great deal on pastoral care and visitation, 
including ministering to the sick and 
dying, working with young couples, performing 
many weddings and baptisms. She has the 
ability to adapt to a variety of worship settings, 
enjoying both a traditional liturgy as well as 
preaching and leading worship in a contemporary 
setting. 

Madam Speaker, I ask that you join with me 
today to honor Ms. Cheryl A. Weunsch. She is 
an outstanding and dedicated member of the 
Baltimore Washington Conference of the 
United Methodist Church. Through her tireless 
efforts in over 9 years of service to the community 
of the Timonium Methodist Church, she 
has shown a unique and committed work ethic 
that few can emulate. It is with great pride that 
I congratulate her on her ordination as a Minister 
in the Methodist Church. 

. . . AND HOW ARE THE 
CHILDREN? 

SPEECH OF 

HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to enter into the record an article titled ‘‘... 
And How Are The Children?’’ published in Witness 
for Justice on April 9, 2007. 

The article highlights a monumental gathering 
of over 50 organizations that came together 
to sponsor the annual Ecumenical Advocacy 
Days Conference in Washington, DC. 
The theme of the conference was ‘‘. . . And 
How Are The Children?’’ The answer, offered 
by executive minister M. Linda Jaramillo is 
‘‘the children are not doing so well.’’ 

Included in the article are abominable facts 
that speak to the crisis facing our nation’s children. 
For example, 9 million children are without 
health care. That is more than the total 
population of large states like Georgia, Minnesota, 
and Virginia. Almost 90 percent of 
these children live in working households, 
most in two-parent families; a fact which destroys 
the myth that only those from broken 
homes are without access to essential resources 
like health care. 

We owe it to our children, to ourselves, and 
to our country to stop the senseless neglect 
experienced by far too many of our most precious 
resource—the future of our nation. The 
article endorses the call to conscience and action 
sponsored by the children’s defense fund. 
I too am in support of their efforts and will do 
all I can to advance this critical issue. 

[From Witness for Justice #315, Apr. 9, 2007] 

‘‘... AND HOW ARE THE CHILREN?’’ 

(By M. Linda Jaramillo) 

How are the children? This is an African 
proverb, but it is not an uncommon question 
for us in our culture. We often greet one another 
with hello, followed by asking the 
question, ‘‘How are you and how are the 
kids?’’ This question can be directed to a 
parent, a teacher, a grandparent, an aunt, an 
uncle, or anyone who spends time around 
children. It doesn’t matter if we are actual 
birth parents because ‘‘the children’’ are 
really part of all our lives, so it seems that 
we should be asking that question to everyone 
we greet. However, I wonder if we listen 
long enough to find out how the children 
really are? 

A few weeks ago, over 50 organizations 
jointly sponsored the annual Ecumenical Advocacy 
Days Conference in Washington, DC. 
This year’s theme was ‘‘. . . And How Are 
the Children?’’ Over 800 persons attended, 
sharing information and stories about critical 
justice issues that have serious impact 
on children all around the world. As I went 
through the days of workshops and discussions 
asking the question, I have to answer 
that ‘‘ . . . the children are not doing so 
well.’’ 

Distinguished theologian, Dietrich 
Bonheoffer said it best when he wrote, ‘‘the 
test of the morality of a society is how it 
treats its children.’’ I would have to confess 
that our nation, the richest nation in the 
world, has failed this moral test. We have 
failed by directing billions of dollars to engage 
in war rather than investing in the future 
of all children. We can make excuse 
after excuse about how we spend our public 
dollars, but we cannot excuse our disregard 
for children. We cannot respond and say that 
the children are doing fine. 


May 1, 2007 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E903 

For example, there is no excuse for 9 million 
children to be without health insurance 
in this country. Almost 90 percent of these 
children live in working households, most in 
two parent-families. Parents are working 
hard, sometimes taking on two jobs to provide 
shelter and food for their children. 
These parents often have to make the choice 
between feeding their families and taking 
them to the doctor or to the dentist. These 
9 million children belongto all of us. How 
they are is everyone’s responsibility. 

Nine million children. That is more than 
the entire population of states like Georgia, 
Virginia, Indiana, Arizona, Minnesota, or 
New Jersey. That is more than the total population 
of almost any single city in this nation. 
These 9 million children come from 
rural, urban, and suburban communities. 
These 9 million children represent all races 
and are of every age under 18. 

‘‘. . . And How are the Children?’’ We can 
do something to help make them better by 
joining the Healthy Child Campaign to cover 
all children with health insurance this year. 
Get involved.

HONORING GIL COLYER 

HON. RON LEWIS 

OF KENTUCKY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay public tribute to Gil Colyer, 
a resident of my district, who is retiring from 
the Hardin County Sheriffs Office this month 
after a remarkable 52-year career. 

Gil Colyer first joined law enforcement in 
1953, serving as a military policeman during 
his service in the Army. In 1955, he was assigned 
to the Louisville Police Department, 
where he would spend the next 21 years. 
Upon retirement from the Louisville PD in 
1976, Gil moved back to Elizabethtown, his 
home town, and took a job as an officer in the 
Elizabethtown Police Department, where he 
remained for an additional 20 years before 
taking his current position as bailiff for the 
Hardin County Sheriff’s Department. 

Gil’s dedication to the Hardin County community 
over the years has been a true inspiration 
to all who know him. Attorneys, police, 
and even prisoners maintain an abiding respect 
for Mr. Colyer. His vast knowledge, work 
ethic, and attention to detail exemplify true 
professionalism, a standard appreciated by his 
fellow officers and members of the public. 

I would also like to congratulate Gil and his 
wife, Alma, as they are celebrating their 50th 
wedding anniversary next week. I join countless 
other neighbors in Hardin County in wishing 
them a very happy and healthy retirement. 

It is my great privilege to recognize Gil 
Colyer today, before the entire House of Representatives, 
for his lifetime of service to Hardin 
County. He is an outstanding American 
worthy of our collective honor and appreciation. 


APPRECIATION OF FAIR HOUSING/ 
FINANCIAL LITERACY MONTH 

HON. BOBBY L. RUSH 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, April is both 
National Fair Housing Month and National Financial 
Literacy Month, and I rise today to acknowledge 
both of these important goals and 
to highlight a serious issue that both of the 
these areas address—home foreclosure 

Many of us have seen the recent reports of 
a skyrocketing increase in the number of foreclosures 
and of people losing their homes. 
Across the country thousands of families have 
had the American dream of homeownership 
snatched away. 

In the 1st Congressional District of Illinois, 
which I am privileged to represent, many of 
my constituents have fallen victim to increases 
in adjustable rate mortgages, high-cost home 
equity lines of credit, and predatory loans 
which have made their dreams of home ownership 
turn into nightmares. 

Homes in Chicago have entered into foreclosure 
at an alarming rate: currently, Chicago 
homeowners are in foreclosure at more than 
twice the national average. One in every 471 
homeowners is in foreclosure: that compares 
with 1 in 1,030 for the Nation. 

In 2006, Cook County, Illinois had 19,522 
foreclosures, up 35 percent from 14,506 in 
2005 and above its peak of 18,612 in 2002. 

These are staggering statistics and they 
have a devastating effect on our neighborhoods. 
As foreclosures rise our communities 
diminish, local property values drop, people 
move out and vacant homes become magnets 
for crime. 

Madam Speaker, we must find solutions to 
the problem of home foreclosures that are in 
the best interests of lenders and financial institutions, 
local and state governments, and most 
critically, our families and communities. 

Homeownership is one of the principal tools 
by which families build generational wealth. If 
done wisely, a person may use their home to 
leverage financial dreams of entrepreneurship, 
property acquisition, and paying for higher 
education. But, in order to achieve these 
goals, consumers must have the tools of financial 
literacy. 

In conclusion Madam Speaker, Congress 
must put the tools of financial literacy into the 
hands of all people and create fair housing 
policies, that protect consumers from the pitfalls 
of financial ruin and foreclosure. 

I encourage my colleagues to use Financial 
Literacy and Fair Housing Month as a catalyst 
for immediate passage of federal predatory 
lending measures that put people before profit.

A TRIBUTE TO MS. PATSY SPIER 

HON. THOMAS G. TANCREDO 

OF COLORADO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. TANCREDO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to one of my constituents, 

Ms. Patsy Spier of Centennial, Colorado. Ms. 
Spier, a former Peace Corps volunteer, was 
recognized by both the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s 
Office for Victim Assistance with 
the ‘‘Strength of the Human Spirit Award,’’ as 
well as by the U.S. Department of Justice with 
the ‘‘Special Courage Award.’’ 

Ms. Spier was among a group of schoolteachers 
who were attacked while based in Indonesia 
in 2002. Patsy and several others 
were severely wounded in the attack, while 
three were killed, including her husband Rick. 
When investigators concluded that there was 
a strong possibility that the Indonesian military 
had been involved, Ms. Spier began to lobby 
Members of Congress and the Departments of 
State and Defense to gain attention to her 
fight for justice. Working with several legislators, 
including myself, she was twice able to 
successfully block U.S. funding toward a military 
training program for the Indonesian military. 
Having gained the support of the Indonesian 
president, she was also successful in 
her pursuit of a life sentence for the leader of 
the attack. 

Patsy should be commended for her bravery, 
determination and commitment to justice. 
I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.

CONGRATULATIONS TO GRACE 
AND NICK VITORI 

HON. JOHN A. BOEHNER 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate, thank, and recognize 
my constituents Grace and Nick Vitori. Nick 
and Grace are a testament to the innate goodness 
of human nature, the overwhelming positive 
effect individuals may have on the community 
and the can-do spirit of America. 

For sixty-one years Nick and Grace have 
been the owners of Vitori’s Marketplace in 
Middletown, Ohio and in less than a month, 
after some seventy-eight years in business, 
this landmark grocery, this priceless slice of 
Americana will close its doors. Nick and Grace 
are as much a Middletown landmark as the 
grocery they own. After serving in World War 
II Nick left college to take over Vitori’s from his 
ailing father, Pasquale, also known as Patsy, 
who opened Vitori’s in 1929. Nick and Grace 
have been watching over Vitori’s ever since. 
Undoubtedly Middletonians will miss Nick’s famous 
ham salad, Grace’s smiling and kind 
face behind the cash register, and their trademark 
red jackets. 

Through good and bad, Nick and Grace and 
Vitori’s Marketplace has loyally, thoughtfully 
and generously served their neighbors. Few in 
Middletown can say their lives haven’t been 
touched by Nick and Grace, and their retirement 
is certainly well earned. 

Grace and Nick Vitori are a testament to the 
American ethos, to the spirit of community and 
a devotion to others. I consider it an honor to 
represent Grace and Nick in Congress, and I 
wish them a long, happy and healthy retirement.

HON. LOIS CAPPS 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
with my fellow Co-Chair of the Women’s Caucus, 
Congresswoman CATHY MCMORRIS ROGERS, 
to join with the members of the Kennedy 
School Women’s Leadership Board in their salute 
to our friend, Adrienne Hall As we applaud 
the heights to which women have ascended, 
whether that is Speaker of the House 
or President of Harvard, we would like to highlight 
the many advocates who labored for our 
benefit. As our generation tallies its contribution 
to the advancement of women and girls in 
America and around the world, we proudly 
recognize the role played by Adrienne Hall. 
Adrienne has been tireless in her devotion to 
advancing the status of women. 

Adrienne is also a trailblazer of entrepreneurship. 
Not only in her professional career, 
but also in her service to the community has 
she been a fountain of creativity. She currently 
chairs the board of the Women Presidents’ Organization, 
but her fingerprints are found on 
many of the most respected and effective 
women’s organizations in the world, including 
the role she played as a founding member of 
the Committee of 200 and her involvement 
and leadership in the International Women’s 
Forum and the Leading Women Entrepreneurs 
of the World. 

Adrienne has also been a seminal part of 
the Women’s Leadership Board at Harvard 
University’s Kennedy School of Govemment. 
This organization supports Harvard’s efforts to 
attract, train and nurture women to become effective 
leaders around the world. It is fitting 
that Harvard has established the Adrienne Hall 
Women’s Mentorship Fund to honor Adrienne 
in perpetuity and to continue the mentorship 
and leadership she has embodied. The 
Mentorship Fund will ensure that her tenacity 
in pursuit of equal opportunity and justice continues 
for women in generations to come.

TRIBUTE TO THE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY 

HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and heartfelt gratitude that I take 
this time to honor the brave men and women 
of our law enforcement services. It is with the 
deepest admiration that I pay tribute to the 
men and women throughout Northwest Indiana 
and the entire country who have made 
the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Each 
year, the Highland, Indiana Fraternal Order of 
Police, Donald R. Sheppard Lodge Number 
122, and the Highland Police Department 
honor these individuals for their courage and 
their commitment to protecting their communities 
at all costs. Annually, two fallen officers 
of the Highland Police Department, Officer 
Donald R. Sheppard, killed in the line of duty 
in November 1971, and Officer Robert J. 
Markley, killed in the line of duty in March 
1978, are remembered for their service to the 
Highland community and for their sacrifice. 

This year, the Highland Fraternal Order of 
Police and the Highland Police Department 
will recognize these fallen heroes, as well as 
all of the law enforcement officers across the 
United States, who have given their lives for 
the protection of our great country. These fine 
men and women will be honored at a memorial 
service during Law Enforcement Memorial 
Week, on Saturday, May 12, 2007, at the 
Highland Town Hall/Police Department. 

As a nation, we owe an enormous debt of 
gratitude to the men and women of the law 
enforcement community. Currently, there are 
over 870,000 law enforcement officers in the 
United States. Each day, these selfless individuals 
start their shifts with one goal in mind: 
to serve and to protect the citizens of their 
communities. The one constant they face is 
the uncertainty of what each day will bring, 
knowing all too well that in any situation, there 
is the potential for danger. Still, these everyday 
heroes honor the commitment they have 
made to the people they serve. 

Law enforcement officers throughout the nation 
have always exemplified dedication and 
loyalty, not only to those they serve, but to 
each other as well. Throughout the United 
States, many law enforcement organizations 
will hold memorials to honor their fallen brothers 
and sisters. In Indiana alone, more than 
345 officers have been killed in the line of 
duty, while the total number of fallen officers 
in the United States is over 17,900. 

These real life heroes are remembered for 
their courage and bravery as they gave their 
lives to protect their communities and our way 
of life. These men and women exemplify the 
valor and strength of our country and its citizens. 


Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my 
other distinguished colleagues join me in commending 
and acknowledging the men and 
women of the law enforcement community, 
both in Northwest Indiana and throughout the 
United States. I also ask that you join me in 
honoring the memory of all fallen law enforcement 
officers throughout the United States, especially 
Officer Donald R. Sheppard and Officer 
Robert J. Markley, for making the ultimate 
sacrifice for their communities. These selfless 
individuals are worthy of the highest honor 
and respect.

Christ. Dr. Lee Roberson, longtime pastor of

University in Chattanooga, Tennessee, 
persevered in faith for years to reach the 
world, teach and preach the Gospel and inspire 
generations to be bold in their work for 
the Lord here on earth. Dr. Roberson made 
significant contributions to all aspects of our 
society and leaves a great legacy of service to 
others for all in our nation to follow. 

In his presence, you felt as though you were 
with Moses himself. Steadfast and deliberate, 
Dr. Lee Roberson made a mark on this world 

and lifted up the Kingdom of God. Rarely will 
you meet a man who made a greater impact 
on the world around him than Dr. Roberson. 
We stand on his shoulders at the foot of his 
Savior’s cross thanking God for his life and 
knowing that heaven will be even more glorious 
when we meet him there. We celebrate 
his 97 years of life.

U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS’ 
HEALTH AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY 
ACT, 2007 
SPEECH OF 

HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, April 25, 2007 

Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of the conference report 
to H.R. 1591, the ‘‘U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans’ 
Health and Iraq Accountability Act.’’ 

For far too long this administration, with no 
oversight from the previous Republican-led 
Congresses, has committed our precious resources 
to this war without a sufficient plan to 
win the peace. It sent our soldiers to war without 
adequate armor and equipment. It wasted 
billions of taxpayers’ dollars in sole-source 
contracts and lost suitcases of cash. 

This war also has severely hampered our 
readiness should a military operation become 
necessary somewhere else in the world. Top 
Army officials have acknowledged that the demands 
placed on the military mostly because 
of the war in Iraq have caused critical shortages 
in the number of available ground troops 
and equipment. With the President’s surge of 
troops in Iraq, we are at a crisis point. 

The mismanagement of this war must not 
continue. The false promises must end. The 
administration’s free pass must be revoked. 

H.R. 1591 provides critical funding for American 
soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan while establishing 
a necessary timeline for the redeployment 
of U.S. forces from Iraq. It also directs 
the president to certify that the Iraqi government 
is making progress in meeting certain 
benchmarks. While the timeline is not as 
strong as the one previously passed by this 
body, I believe that we are moving in the right 
direction. 
The bill includes $2.1 billion more in funding 
than the president requested for military health 
care and $1.8 billion more than the President’s 
request for veterans’ health care. The Walter 
Reed scandal showed the potential for far 
more widespread problems across the military 
health care system if we do not act now to 
take better care of our war veterans. More 
troops are returning home injured than our 
government predicted or was prepared for, 
and the system runs the risk of being 
stretched thin. Taking care of the men and 
women who have battled with the stars and 
stripes on their shoulders is more than a feel-
good issue, it is a moral issue. 

When Americans enlist in the Armed 
Forces, they are assuming the responsibility of 
defending our country. They do so with the 
belief that their country will assume the responsibility 
of taking care of their injuries as 
attentively and humanely as possible. Today, 
we are taking steps to ensure that what happened 
at Walter Reed will not happen anywhere 
else. 

I also want to commend the conferees for 
including $50 million for Ground Zero workers

and responders who risked their lives and are 
now suffering devastating health effects because 
of their brave service following the 9/11 
terrorist attacks. 

I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

HON. KEITH ELLISON 

OF MINNESOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, Indian 
Americans have contributed greatly to the vibrancy, 
creative thought, and diversity of our 
Nation. The large and growing population of 
Indian Americans in Minnesota has enriched 
our neighborhoods and communities and continues 
to play an important role in improving 
the lives of all Americans. It is with these advances 
in mind that we celebrate the growth 
of relations between the United States and 
India and look forward to promoting a closer 
friendship amongst our two countries. 

I’m proud to join the Congressional Caucus 
on India and Indian Affairs and look forward to 
working with my fellow Members of Congress 
through the promotion of our shared values 
and concerns. I stand with India and Indian 
Americans in promoting peace, prosperity, and 
happiness for all the world’s people.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF LANCE 
CORPORAL DANIEL R. SCHERRY 

HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. KUCINICH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory and honor of Lance Corporal 
Daniel R. Scherry. He served our country courageously 
until his death on April 16, 2007. 
His brief but passionate career is an inspiration 
to the community and the brave Marines 
who continue to fight. 

Daniel, born in Cleveland, was a graduate 
of Rocky River High School. He was an invaluable 
member of the varsity football team, 
where his determination and leadership helped 
the Pirates transform into a dominant football 
team. Daniel’s presence extended off the playing 
field as he continued to mentor the students 
of his alma mater before he was deployed 
to Iraq. 

After his graduation in 2005, Daniel continued 
to be an active member of the community 
and enrolled himself as a student at the Tri-C 
Fire Academy. He received hands-on training 
and underwent intensive classes that fueled 
his desire to serve our country. In April 2006, 
Daniel fulfilled his dream and enlisted in the 
Marine Corps. 

In September, Daniel was assigned to the 
1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, Regimental 
Combat Team 2 of the 2nd Marine Division, 
II Marine Expeditionary Force in Camp 
Lejeune, NC. Daniel served as an infantry 
mortar man and his diligence and hard work 
did not go unnoticed. Within his first year of 
duty, Daniel was quickly promoted twice to the 
level of Lance Corporal. 

Lance Corporal Daniel Scherry is survived, 
but greatly missed by his parents, siblings, 
and extended family. 

Madam Speaker and colleagues, please join 
me in honoring serviceman Lance Corporal 
Daniel Scherry. He is an American hero and 
his sacrifice will always be remembered by the 
lives he touched.

EXPRESSING SORROW OF THE 
HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE 
HONORABLE JUANITA 
MILLENDER-MCDONALD, MEMBER 
OF CONGRESS FROM THE STATE 
OF CALIFORNIA 

SPEECH OF 

HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Monday, April 23, 2007 

Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
my presence on this floor today is marked by 
a sad and heavy melancholy over the loss of 
a friend and dearest colleague. We have lost 
a good friend, indeed a great friend, in Congresswoman 
JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. I 
wish to extend with deepest sincerity my sympathy 
and condolences to her family and to 
her constituents of Long Beach, Compton, and 
Los Angeles. 

It is a common tradition in our society to 
look past the loss of the physical being in 
order to best preserve and cherish the personal 
being. However, the difficulty in this 
emerges when we constantly find ourselves 
reveling in the presence of that person as an 
everyday part of our lives. Congresswoman 
MILLENDER-MCDONALD will be so sorely 
missed. She was and is still a part of our everyday 
lives. It is hard to fathom the idea that 
we will never hear her voice again—for her 
eloquence and passion in speaking, and her 
unforgettable laughter, will ring in our ears. 
The strength and tenacity that propelled her 
through her life’s work will continue to inspire 
us. As we continue our work in her memory, 
I encourage all of us to remember her as we 
walk through the hallowed Halls of Congress. 
If we stop and listen, we will hear her footsteps 
echo in these great marble corridors. 

JUANITA’s accomplishments and achievements 
in life were many. But as we mourn the 
loss of her physical-self, we would do well to 
remember her compassionate-self, her temperate-
self, which encompassed an unfailing 
dedication to public service. I most humbly 
thank Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD 
for her being an exemplary public servant. I 
praise her for her stalwart fight against cancer. 
At last, I am comforted by the fact that her 
truly unconquerable soul is yet unvanquished.

RECOGNIZING APRIL 25, 2007, AS 
DENIM DAY IN LOS ANGELES 

HON. HILDA L. SOLIS 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Ms. SOLIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
join with Peace Over Violence, the Sexual Assault 
Awareness Campaign in Los Angeles, 
and the Los Angeles City Council in recog


nizing April 25, 2007, as Denim Day in Los 
Angeles. 

Denim Day was established to show solidarity 
with rape victims everywhere. In an outrageous 
court decision in 1997, an Italian 
judge argued that because a woman was 
wearing tight jeans that her attacker forced her 
to remove herself, then the crime was not 
rape. Appalled by the verdict women in the 
Italian Parliament protested, by wearing denim 
to work. Their willingness to stand up for the 
rights of victims of sexual assault and rape 
empowered communities around the world to 
do the same. 

For 9 consecutive years, sexual assault 
awareness advocates throughout Los Angeles 
have come together through Denim Day activities 
to call attention to the terrible crimes of 
rape and other sexual assaults and to say to 
the world that there is never an excuse. Domestic 
violence, rape, and sexual assault affect 
women, children, and men of all racial, 
cultural, and economic backgrounds. While 
one person, organization, agency or community 
cannot eliminate sexual assault alone, together 
we can educate our communities to 
prevent these attacks. 

I will continue to fight for the rights of victims 
of sexual assault and domestic violence, 
and express my strong support for all programs 
aimed at the elimination of all violence 
against women. I am honored to recognize 
April 25, 2007, as Denim Day in Los Angeles 
and encourage everyone to wear jeans in support 
of the victims and the fight against domestic 
violence and sexual assault.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FARM 
RESERVOIR ACT 

HON. TERRY EVERETT 

OF ALABAMA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. EVERETT. Madam Speaker, I am introducing 
legislation today, along with my colleagues 
Representatives ROBERT ADERHOLT, 
JO BONNER, MIKE ROGERS, and JIM MARSHALL, 
to assist American farmers in dealing with 
drought conditions and enable them to increase 
their farm productivity. The need for 
on-the-farm drought management has become 
increasingly evident as farmers and the government 
struggle to keep ahead of the effects 
of Mother Nature. The drought conditions for 
the 2005 and 2006 crop years underscored 
the devastating toll natural disasters have on 
our Nation’s farmers and ranchers. The current 
approach of providing ad hoc disaster assistance 
is inadequate and does not give 
farmers the certainty they need. The Farm 
Reservoir Act would provide cost-share assistance 
to agricultural producers for the construction 
of small reservoirs on their farms. 

By combining sound planning with the right 
resources, agricultural producers can reduce 
the impact droughts have on their operations. 
Small on-farm storage reservoirs are an economical 
way to save water for summer use. 
The collection and storage of surface water 
during the off-season, when rainfall and 
stream levels are typically high, can make irrigation 
possible in areas where direct pumping 
from streams, lakes, or wells during the growing 
season is not feasible. Because these reservoirs 
are small, the engineering and construction 
cost per acre-foot are less than big 


E906 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks May 1, 2007 

on-stream reservoirs. Additionally, they are 
more acceptable from an environmental perspective, 
because they are off-stream and do 
not block streams or disturb riverine habitats. 

In addition to protecting our Nation’s farmers 
from the costly effects of drought, enhancing 
their irrigation capacity will allow our farmers 
to expand production to more acres and increase 
the productivity of existing acres. Cost-
share assistance to construct small, environ-
mentally-friendly, reservoirs located on the 
farm will provide us with the tools necessary 
to grow additional bio-fuel crops; which will 
allow us to wean ourselves from foreign oil. 
This will reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions 
by increasing the availability of the 
cleaner burning fuels these crops produce.

GENETIC INFORMATION 
NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 

SPEECH OF 

HON. JOE BARTON 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, April 25, 2007 

Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
want to commend the work of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee in making certain improvements 
to H.R. 493. In particular, I note 
the inclusion of information on embryos, 
fetuses, and adopted children. I further note a 
clear statement that nothing affects claims 
processing and quality improvement activities 
and related items. Finally, I am happy that 
there is a provision for covered entities already 
subject to regulations governing personally 
identifiable health information. 

The primary author of the House bill, Ms. 
SLAUGHTER, has stated: 

‘‘GINA prohibits group health plans and 
health insurers from denying coverage to a 
healthy individual or charging that person 
higher premiums based solely on a genetic 
predisposition to develop a disease in the future. 
Furthermore, it bars employers from 
using an individual’s genetic information 
when making hiring, firing, job placement or 
promotion decisions.’’ 

That is the focus of this legislation. I expect 
the relevant Federal agencies will interpret this 
bill in light of the primary focus. GINA is a very 
complicated bill with a number of definitions 
capable of counterproductive readings. We 
have tried to improve the bill to reduce these 
problems. In the spirit of these efforts to improve 
the legislation I support its passage 
from the House and look forward to work in 
Conference.

SPOKANE NAMED 2006 ABILENE 
TROPHY WINNER 

HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 

OF WASHINGTON 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to commend the Spokane 
community for their work in supporting 
Fairchild Air Force Base in Washington State. 
On April 12, 2007, Spokane was selected as 
the 2006 Abilene Trophy winner during the 
Phoenix Rally at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. 


The Abilene Trophy, sponsored by the Abilene, 
Texas, Chamber of Commerce, recognizes 
the community that provides the most 
outstanding support to an Air Mobility Command 
unit. The 92nd Air Refueling Wing at 
Fairchild is one of 11 Air Mobility Command 
bases eligible to compete for the Abilene Trophy 
in the United States. 

The Abilene Chamber of Commerce noted 
Spokane’s standout support for our troops at 
Fairchild, particularly through programs such 
as Operation Spokane Heroes and the Honorary 
Commanders program. 

As a member of the House Armed Services 
Committee, I am committed to keeping our 
Nation and communities safe by ensuring we 
have a trained and equipped military. Since 
taking office, one of my top priorities has been 
to protect and expand the mission of Fairchild 
Air Force Base. The people of Spokane share 
that priority and recognize the importance of 
supporting our men and women in uniform 
and their families. 

Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Spokane and the members of this community 
for their outstanding support of Fairchild Air 
Force Base. I invite my colleagues to join me 
in congratulating the Spokane community on 
this great achievement.

ACCEPT TAIWAN INTO THE WHO 

HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 

OF IDAHO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to express my support for Taiwan’s efforts to 
participate in the World Health Organization. 
Taiwan’s participation in the WHO is a health 
issue rather than a political issue. Taiwan has 
been directly impacted by many of the new, 
global health threats that have swept Asia 
since 2002. During the outbreak of Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, Taiwan 
saw one of the highest incident rates of 
infection. More recently, Taiwan has reported 
incidences of avian flu outbreak, a disease 
which presents a global threat. 

For many years, in my district, Idaho State 
University hosted a unique program providing 
a language and cultural education program for 
junior diplomatic officers in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. I spent time discussing the American 
political system and current events in Taiwan 
with the junior diplomats, and they taught 
me a great deal about Taiwan’s political system 
and the challenges it faces. As Taiwan 
deals with new arising health threats, the lessons 
that I learned from the young diplomats 
reminded me of the importance of ensuring 
that all people throughout the world can access 
resources to fight potential pandemics. 

Madam Speaker, global health pandemics 
recognize no borders. Taiwan has been seeking 
observer status at the WHO since 1997. 
Other non-sovereign entities, such as the Holy 
See, maintain observer status. Protecting people’s 
health is not a political issue, and gaining 
access to global health organizations should 
not be a political issue either. Safeguarding 
world health requires the participation of everyone 
in the international community. Madam 
Speaker, I urge the international community to 
accept Taiwan into the WHO community this 
year. 

HONORING MICHAEL D. THOMAS 

HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Michael D. Thomas, who was 
killed on April 27, 2007 in Hirat Province, Afghanistan, 
in support of Operation Enduring 
Freedom. Michael was a sniper, a weapons 
sergeant and a combat medic assigned to the 
1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group, Fort 
Bragg, North Carolina, and was killed when 
his unit came under rocket-propelled grenades 
and small-arms fire. 

I did not have the privilege of knowing Staff 
Sergeant Thomas personally but by all accounts 
he was a dedicated family man who 
was devoted to serving his country. He grew 
up in Seffner, Florida and joined the military 
police in 1991, serving in Somalia and in 
Korea. After already having served in the military 
police for 13 years and with only 31/2 
years until he could retire, he volunteered to 
be a Green Beret. At 34, Michael was one of 
the oldest in his unit which earned him the 
nickname ‘‘Gramps.’’ 

Michael was a highly decorated soldier. His 
awards and commendations include the Army 
Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement 
Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the National 
Defense Service Medal, the Korean Defense 
Medal, the Parachutist Badge and the Special 
Forces Tab. 

Michael was an avid Tampa Bay Buccaneer 
fan who visited the team’s training camp 
whenever he could. I’ve been told that he 
decorated his Fort Bragg room with Buccaneer 
memorabilia, including signed footballs and 
helmets. He was also an accomplished 
guitarist who liked watching movies and going 
for long walks with his wife, Teresa. 

Madam Speaker, my heart aches for Michael’s 
family. He leaves behind his wife, Teresa, 
his children, Diana and Craig, his sisters, 
Krista and Cassie, and his parents, Debbie 
and Robert Kirpatrick. May God bless the 
Thomas family and continue to watch over the 
country that Staff Sgt. Thomas so loved. We 
shall never forget him.

TRIBUTE TO MS. PAIGE E. 
MCMANUS 

HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 

OF IDAHO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to Ms. Paige E. McManus, 
former staff director for the Subcommittee on 
Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs of 
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, who recently 
concluded 13 years of honorable service in 
this body. 

During my tenure as chairman of the Veterans 
Affairs Subcommittee on Benefits in the 
107th Congress, my colleagues and I were direct 
beneficiaries of Ms. McManus’s counsel 
on legislative, policy, budgetary, and oversight 
matters. 

Ms. McManus’s considerable expertise 
served the subcommittee in many thematic 
areas. She oversaw the $24 billion per year 
Department of Veterans Affairs disability compensation 
and pension entitlement program, 
including herbicide-related disabilities, cold 
weather-related disabilities, Persian Gulf 
undiagnosed illnesses, disabilities common to 
ex-POWs, adapted housing and automobile 
benefits for seriously disabled veterans, Medal 
of Honor special pension benefits, and Merchant 
Mariner benefits; the surviving spouse 
programs, including dependency and indemnity 
compensation, Survivor Benefit Plan, and 
CHAMPVA; burial benefits and services under 
VA’s National Cemetery Administration and 
the State Cemetery Grants Program, as well 
as policy matters associated with Arlington 
National Cemetery and the American Battle 
Monuments Commission; and national insurance 
programs, such as Veterans’ Group life 
Insurance and Servicemembers’ Group life Insurance. 


Ms. McManus’s longstanding work at the direction 
of Veterans’ Affairs Committee leadership 
on the creation of the World War II Memorial 
and VA’s National Shrines initiative, enactment 
of special combat pay, or concurrent 
receipt, and dependency and indemnity compensation 
for remarried spouses proved especially 
meritorious. The legislative road traveled 
by each of these measures was long and exceptionally 
arduous. Ms. McManus’s advice 
and perseverance added great value. The 
depth and breadth of her policy expertise and 
advice indeed proved hard to match. 

Madam Speaker, Paige McManus has exemplified 
the highest ideals of public service 
serving the Committee with honor, integrity, 
and energy. Thank you, Paige, for your many 
years of dedicated service to the United 
States Congress and to our Nation. 

A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN 
BURMA 

HON. THOMAS G. TANCREDO 

OF COLORADO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. TANCREDO. Madam Speaker, a humanitarian 
crisis is occurring in Burma where 
political dissidents and ethnic groups are 
being suppressed. The existence of over 
1,000 political prisoners, the practice of land 
confiscation and forced migration, demonstrates 
the totalitarianism with which this 
military government rules over its people. Citizens 
are being imprisoned for peaceful opposition 
while state members continue to violate 
fundamental rights to property and security. 
The house arrest of non-violent, prodemocracy 
activist Aung Sang Suu Kyi demonstrates this 
oppressive state of affairs. 

Practices like forced evictions and internal 
displacement cements military control, especially 
in ethnic areas, at the expense of basic 
freedoms. I am here today to ask the government 
of Burma to address these numerous 
concerns. The government must draft a constitution 
with the input of all political actors, including 
members of the National League for 
Democracy. Land use, property rights, and political 
rights are issues that must be addressed. 
Human rights abusers must be punished 
and civilians brought to justice under a 
government that defends their freedoms.

HONORING ARMY STAFF SERGEANT 
ROBERT SPEED, JR. OF 
MOBILE, ALABAMA, A WWII 
HERO RECENTLY AWARDED THE 
DISTINGUISHED FLYING CROSS 

HON. JO BONNER 

OF ALABAMA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. BONNER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to Army Staff Sgt. Robert 
Speed, Jr., who was recently honored with the 
Distinguished Flying Cross for his service and 
sacrifice in defense of our great country during 
World War II. 

Sgt. Speed and the entire B–24 crew: 1st 
Lt. James E. Jatho, 1st Lt. Edward L. McNally, 
2nd Lt. George N. Croft, 2nd Lt. Theodore D. 
Bell, Technical Sgt. Jay T. Fish, Technical Sgt. 
William A. Magill, Staff Sgt. Frank G. Celuck, 
Staff Sgt. William F. Maxson, Jr., and Staff 
Sgt. Daniel P. Toomey distinguished themselves 
by extraordinary achievement while 
participating in aerial combat on July 15, 1944. 
The B–24 crew in the 779th Bomb Squadron, 
464th Bomber Group, 15th Air Force took off 
from Pantanella, Italy, to take part in what was 
to become the heaviest day of bombing the oil 
refineries near Ploesti, Romania. 

The crew encountered heavy anti-aircraft 
fire—severely damaging the plane—and causing 
the loss of one engine. Sgt. Speed, a gunner 
on the B–24 Liberator, courageously 
manned his gun position and remained at his 
station throughout the remainder of the flight, 
which went deep into enemy territory. The 
mission was successful—the Uniera 
Sperantza oil refinery and enemy refining capacity 
were heavily damaged. 

The day following this mission, the crew 
continued to demonstrate courage and devotion 
to duty when it took part in a raid on 
Weiner Neusdorf, Austria. During this mission, 
their plane was shot down, and Sgt. Magill 
was killed in action. The surviving crew members 
were captured and taken as prisoners of 
war and held for the remainder of the war. 

Almost 63 years later, the nine surviving 
members of the crew were awarded the Distinguished 
Flying Cross. 

Madam Speaker, the life and actions of Sgt. 
Speed personify the very best America has to 
offer. I feel certain his many friends and family, 
as well as his comrades in the United 
States Army, are taking this opportunity to remember 
his many accomplishments. I urge my 
colleagues to take a moment and pay tribute 
to Sgt. Robert Speed and his selfless devotion 
to our country and the freedom we enjoy. 

Make no mistake; Robert Speed is a true 
American hero.

HONORING JESSICA LONG 

HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER 

OF MARYLAND 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise before you today to honor Jessica Long, 
in celebration other selection as 2006 U.S. 
Paralympian of the Year by the United States 
Olympic Committee. 

Jessica Long was born in Siberia and was 
adopted from a Russian orphanage at the age 
of 13 months along with her brother Joshua by 
Steven and Beth Long of Middle River, Maryland. 
Because of lower leg anomalies, her 
legs were amputated when she was 18 
months old. She learned to walk with prostheses 
and has been unstoppable ever since. 
Long has been involved in many sports including 
gymnastics, cheerleading, ice skating, 
biking, trampoline, and, of course, she loves to 
swim. She began swimming in her grandparent’s 
pool before joining her first competitive 
team in 2002. The next year, Jessica was 
selected as Maryland Swimming’s 2003 Female 
Swimmer with a Disability of the Year. 
Jessica made the international swimming 
world take notice at the 2004 Paralympic 
Games, winning three gold medals. Only 12 
years old at the time, Jessica was the youngest 
athlete on the U.S. Paralympic Team. 

Jessica had a phenomenal year in 2006 
with a long list of impressive accomplishments. 
She set five world records and earned 
nine gold medals at the 2006 International 
Paralympic Committee Swimming World 
Championships in Durban, South Africa in December. 
Her gold medal performances were in 
free style relay (world record), 100-meter 
backstroke, 100-meter freestyle (world record), 
100-meter fly (world record), IM relay, 100-
meter breast stroke, 200-meter IM (world 
record), 400-meter freestyle (world record), 
and 50-meter freestyle. She also set three 
world records at the 2006 U.S. Paralympic National 
championships in August; two world 
records at the GTAC Open in Ypsilanti, Michigan, 
in May; two world records at the Belgian 
Open in Antwerp, Belgium in May; and four 
world records at the Spring Can-Am in London, 
Ontario, in April. She currently holds 
world records in 12 events, one as part of a 


E908 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks May 1, 2007 

relay. She is Swimming World’s 2006 Disabled 
Swimmer of the Year and was named a finalist 
for the Women’s Sports Foundation’s 
Sportswoman of the Year. 

Madam Speaker, I ask that you join with me 
today to honor Ms. Jessica Long. She is an 
outstanding and dedicated member of the 
United States Paralympic Team. In spite of 
her disability, she has shown a unique and 
committed work ethic in sports training and 
competition. Jessica has shown the world that 
no limitation can prevent an individual from 
achieving great success. It is with great pride 
that I congratulate her on her selection as the 
2006 United States Paralympian of the Year.

Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, the loss of 
Jack Valenti is a blow not only to his family

Jack embodied the American values we hold 
most dear: he was thoughtful, he was loyal, he

to his family. 

Jack was also a brave and decorated soldier, 
and his service during the Second World 
War instilled in him an unshakeable devotion 
to our country and to the principles for which 
it stands. Returning from the European theater, 
he continued to defend and promote 
these values as a public servant, and helped 
to guide our Nation through one of its darkest 
hours. While serving as a special assistant to 
President Lyndon Johnson directly after the 
assassination of John F. Kennedy, Jack’s 
steadying influence played a central role in 
helping the country grieve, understand, and 
heal. 

However, perhaps his greatest contributions 
came later in life, once he became the motion 
picture industry’s consummate Washington, 
DC representative. Jack’s name will forever be 
associated with the movies, not only because 
his personality reflected the way that films can 
inspire and cheer us, but because so much of 
what we enjoy in today’s movie theaters we 
can attribute to his years of tireless and effective 
advocacy. 

As a Californian, I am particularly aware of 
the debt of gratitude that we owe to Jack. The 
enduring importance of Hollywood in our culture, 
the rating system which protects our children 
from inappropriate content, the very majesty 
of film itself, all of these are parts of 
Jack’s legacy. His life is a prime example of 
the good that can come from combining the 
idealism and fantasy of film with the determination 
and focus of the American work 
ethic. 

I extend my deepest condolences to Mary 
Margaret and to the rest of the Valenti family. 
Though there is little solace that can be offered 
during a time of mourning such as this, 
I hope it comforts them to know that Jack’s 
contributions will forever be a part of the fabric 
of American culture. While his presence will 
be sorely missed, Jack’s legacy will always be 
relevant and vibrant so long as movies continue 
to entertain, motivate, and inspire.

HONORING THE CANYON HIGH 
SCHOOL COWBOY FOOTBALL TEAM 

HON. HOWARD P. ‘‘BUCK’’ McKEON 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, May 1, 2007 

Mr. MCKEON. Madam Speaker, before the 
school term ends this year in the Santa Clarita 
Valley, I wish to recognize the coaches and 
athletes of Canyon High School’s football program 
for their outstanding performance during 
the 2006 high school football season. Canyon 
High School’s varsity football team completed 
their season by defeating the De la Salle 
Spartans of Concord, the No. 1-ranked high 
school team in the Nation, with a score of 27– 
13 to clinch the first California State Division 
I championship in 79 years. 

MaxPreps, a California-based national high 
school sports information web site, lauded 
Canyon High School’s football program and 
ranked Canyon High School’s football program 
as the 10th best in the Nation. This ranking 
was achieved amongst a field of over 15,000 
schools nation-wide. The ethos of this tightly 
knit team should serve as an example to all 
those aspiring to greatness. 

The level of devotion and resolve displayed 
by coaches and players of Canyon High 
School’s football program is exemplary. I 

would like to commend the coaching staff, including 
Harry Welch, Dave Ends, Chris 
Rzewuski, Monterio Witherspoon, Bryan Wilson, 
Tim Hollinger, Ken Wheeler, Mike Civita, 
Rod Baltau, Robert Hendricks, Billy Omahen, 
and John DiLuigi, for their energy, enthusiasm 
and expertise. Congratulations are also due to 
Coach Harry Welch for winning the California 
Coaches Association’s 2007 State of California 
Football Coach of the Year award. 

I would like to recognize the individual members 
of Canyon High School’s champion football 
team. Chad Adams, Britt Briscoe, Joshua 
Carvalho, Brandon Chandler, Sean Crane, 
Chris Duncan, Eric Ernenputsch, Jordan Ferguson, 
Sean Gavin, Jonathan Hammock, Garret 
Hernandez, Joshua Hickman, Michael 
Hollinger, Eric James, Jesse Kelley, Mario 
Mestizo, Ryan Nichols, Brandon Reeves, Brice 
Reiner, Danny Robinson, Kenny Shanahan, 
Mike Spagnola, Danny Valdez, Justin Wallace, 
Adam Woodard, and Trevor Yslas. 

In addition, congratulations are due to returning 
players for their second year of championship 
play. They are: Fares Albichara, Ben 
Armbruster, Anthony Arriaga, Michael Blanco, 
Christopher Chapman, Michael Cooper, John 
DiLuigi, Mike Harker, Nic Jurado, Anthony 
King, Christopher Kingsbury, Randy Lemus, 
Ben Longshore, Michael Loucks, Nick Madia, 
Cipriano Maldonado, Andrew Martinez, Blake 
McMartin, Julian Murillo, Nick Peterson, Michael 
Pyne, Dillon Schelske, Kenny Suber, 
Mark Urbina, Marc Valdez, AJ Wallerstein, 
Sean Ward, and Stephen Wirthlin. Their hard 
work and perseverance has taught them to 
balance academics and athletics and I applaud 
their efforts. 

Coach Joe Paterno, current Head Coach of 
Pennsylvania State University, once said, 
‘‘When a team outgrows individual performance 
and learns team confidence, excellence 
becomes a reality.’’ Exemplifying all that is 
right with team spirit, the Canyon High School 
Football team is a stellar example of fortitude, 
courage, and tenacity. They have proven that 
by doing what is necessary, then going on to 
what is possible, they were able to accomplish 
what many thought would be impossible. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the Canyon High School football 
team for their triumphant season and to 
wish them best of luck in all their future endeavors.

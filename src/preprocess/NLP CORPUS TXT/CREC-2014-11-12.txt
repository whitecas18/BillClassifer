PRAYER 

The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 

J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
God of the universe, we give You 
thanks for giving us another day. 
A full week later, we are thankful 
that we live in a nation where a peaceful 
change or readjustment of government 
is not only expected, but 
achieved. May it ever be so. 

Bless the Members of this assembly 
as they return to the work facing 
them, work that needs to be done. Give 
them the wisdom they need and the 
charity they must possess to work together. 
Help them to make wise decisions 
in a good manner. 

We ask Your blessing as well on 
those newly elected, or reelected, to 
this assembly. May they fully understand 
the trust that has been given 
them to represent not only those whose 
votes they received, but those who did 
not vote for them as well. All are citizens 
to be represented by the new 
Members of this people’s House. 

May Your blessing, O God, be with 
them and with us all this day and every 
day to come, and may all we do be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 

Amen.

H7904 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE November 12, 2014 

You see, Veterans Day is where we 
have an opportunity to thank the few 
who have answered their Nation’s call 
to defend us from enemies at home and 
abroad. 

These are the men and women who 
will walk through the gates of hell to 
stand up against evil and danger so we 
do not have to. 

Veterans don’t ask for much, so it is 
not a hard holiday to celebrate. A simple 
‘‘thank you’’ will do just fine. 

But I want to ask the American people 
to never forget the sacrifices that 
these fine men and women and their 
families make for us. And as a Nation, 
we must keep our promises we made to 
these defenders of freedom. 

Veterans love our American flag. It 
represents the greatest Nation in the 
history of mankind. Fly it proudly. 
Simply put, be proud to be an American. 
For a veteran, that is thanks 
enough.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CAROL J. 
LANCASTER 

(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) 


Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the life of Carol J. Lancaster, 
the visionary educator, public servant, 
and trailblazing dean of the Georgetown 
School of Foreign Service, who 
passed away last month. 

Born to working-class parents during 
the Second World War, Lancaster became 
the first in her family to attend 
college. At Georgetown University, she 
became one of the first women to earn 
a bachelor of science degree from the 
School of Foreign Service. Following 
graduation, Dean Lancaster was awarded 
a Fulbright fellowship to study at 
the Universidad de San Andres in La 
Paz, Bolivia, adding Spanish to the five 
additional languages she would learn in 
adulthood. Lancaster later earned a 
doctorate in international relations 
from the London School of Economics 
in 1972. 

After teaching in England and following 
a series of prestigious fellowships, 
she was called to serve in the 

U.S. Department of State as a member 
of the policy planning staff, and in the 
early eighties she became Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State for African 
Affairs at the State Department. During 
the Clinton administration, she 
served as Deputy Administrator of 
USAID. In every position, she focused 
her time and talent on creating a better 
world for all our children. 
At the end of her government service, 
Lancaster’s commitment to building 
the next generation of global leaders 
compelled her to teach at the Walsh 
School of Foreign Service, where she 
inspired students, encouraged scholars, 
strengthened diplomacy, and authored 
numerous books and articles for more 
than 30 years. At Georgetown, Lancaster 
motivated a new generation of 
young leaders, thinkers, and problem 

solvers to soar to greater heights and 
tackle today’s challenges with vigor, 
compassion, and courage. 

Mr. Speaker, her legacy of excellence 
continues to echo through Georgetown’s 
community. Georgetown University 
President Jack DeGioia noted 
that Lancaster ‘‘provided extraordinary 
leadership as dean of SFS and 
was a leader and a professor contributing 
in countless ways to our community 
through her vision and scholarship. 
Moreover, the joy and dedication 
that Carol brought to her work inspired 
us all to be the very best 
versions of ourselves,’’ he said. 

Chairman of the Foreign Service 
School’s Board of Visitors, my husband, 
Paul Pelosi, noted that as the 
first woman and first alumnus to become 
dean of the School of Foreign 
Service, she ‘‘was renowned for her 
commitment to her students; she demonstrated 
both intellectual curiosity 
and courage and had a profound effect 
on the way we think about global development. 
Carol will be remembered 
as a pioneering woman in international 
affairs and a stalwart champion of 
human dignity.’’ 

In conclusion, when speaking around 
the world, Lancaster also had to stand 
on what she called the ‘‘Madeline 
Albright box’’ to be seen over podiums. 
Today, thousands of young students 
and women from across the world stand 
on her shoulders, inspired by her example 
and empowered by her leadership to 
speak boldly, act bravely, and make 
their mark in the world. 

May it be a comfort to her husband, 
Curt, their son, Douglas, who is with us 
today with his wife, and the entire 
Farrar family that so many people 
around the world mourn their loss, 
share their grief, and are praying for 
them at this sad time. 

President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of 
Liberia said it best: ‘‘May she rest in 
peace for her long years of labor to 
make the world a better place.’’ 

f 

UMITA 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, you can’t 
turn on the TV this week without hearing 
about MIT economist Jonathan 
Gruber’s comments that ObamaCare 
was passed by exploiting the lack of information 
given to the American people. 
In his comments, Gruber, a key architect 
of the legislation, called the 
lack of transparency involved in passing 
ObamaCare ‘‘a huge political advantage.’’ 
President Obama has claimed that 
his administration is the most transparent 
administration in history, but 
statements like Gruber’s indicate otherwise. 
It is long past time for Congress to 
require transparency from the executive 
branch. Earlier this year, a bipartisan 
majority in the House passed my 
bill, H.R. 899, the Unfunded Mandates 

Information and Transparency Act, 
which we call UMITA. This bipartisan 
legislation would improve transparency 
and public disclosure of the 
true costs in dollars and in jobs that 
Federal dictates pose to the economy. 

Asking the Federal Government to 
disclose the cost of a mandate in addition 
to its benefits should not be controversial. 
It is just plain common 
sense, Mr. Speaker. I call on the Senate 
to pass UMITA and put transparency 
back in government. 

f 

JONATHAN GRUBER’S STATE


MENTS ARE SHOCKING BUT NOT 

SURPRISING 

(Mr. BURGESS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, in 2009, 
President-elect Obama wrote a memo 
that his Presidency will usher in an unprecedented 
level of openness. But this 
week, it was revealed that the lead architect 
for the Affordable Care Act, 
Jonathan Gruber, capitalized on—his 
words now—the stupidity of the American 
people in passing the health care 
law. He further went on to say the lack 
of transparency is a huge political advantage 
and was critical to passing the 
law. 

This insult to the American people is 
shocking, but it is hardly surprising. In 
2011, the Energy and Commerce Committee 
uncovered evidence of secret 
meetings at the White House where 
they were setting the stage for the 
takeover of America’s healthcare. At 
the time, their work was discounted. 
Old news, they said. But was it really? 

The American people sent a message 
last week, and the message was they 
are not stupid. This administration, 
which finds value in opacity while 
talking transparency, needs to conduct 
its business in the light of day, exactly 
as they promised in 2009. 

f 

IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIANTS 
DEADLINE 

(Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 

Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, 
we are now less than 2 weeks away 
from the Iran nuclear negotiations 
deadline. 

A deal that allows Iran to enrich any 
uranium and to keep in place its nuclear 
infrastructure is a bad deal. As 
long as Iran maintains the capability 
to enrich uranium, it can create a nuclear 
weapon. 

The administration has always misinterpreted 
the goal of our sanctions. 
They are to compel Iran to completely 
abandon its nuclear pursuit. 

As the deadline looms and as Republicans 
are set to control Congress, I 
urge my colleagues to not allow President 
Obama to trade away the only leverage 
we have over the mullahs in 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7905 

Tehran in exchange for minor and easy 
reversible modifications by Iran on its 
nuclear weapons program. Simply 
pushing back Iran’s breakout time is 
not in the interests of the U.S. national 
security. Ensuring that there 
will never be an Iranian bomb is in our 
Nation’s interest. 

f 

RUSSIAN BEAR IS ROARING AGAIN 
(Mr. POE of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, while 
the eyes of the world are on ISIS, the 
Russian bear has quietly come out of 
hibernation. Putin is back after a brief 
hiatus, seeking to devour his neighbors 
and reclaim his kingdom while once 
again sending covert henchmen into 
eastern Ukraine. The Napoleon of Siberia 
is systematically trying to reestablish 
imperial Russia with him as the 
czar. 
According to U.S. General Phillip 
Breedlove, recently, ‘‘new Russian 
tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air 
defense systems, and Russian combat 
troops have entered eastern Ukraine.’’ 
News reports indicate five of the trucks 
were towing 120-millimeter howitzer 
artillery pieces, and another five were 
towing partly covered multilaunch 
rocket systems. 
This sounds like an aggression to me. 
Of course, the Kremlin lies and denies 
it all. And why is this aggression 
continuing? Because, on the world 
stage, America looks weak and 
leaderless. Reset buttons and red lines 
don’t mean anything to Putin. Our hollow 
objections to Russia are meaningless. 
The Russian bear needs to stop its 
cold war II-type aggression and return 
back to the cave. 
Mr. Speaker, what is America’s plan? 
And that is just the way it is. 

f 

ELECTORATE VOTES TO STOP 
OBAMA 

(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, on October 2, the President 
promised, ‘‘I’m not on the ballot this 
fall, but my policies are on the ballot.’’ 

Clearly, America, which is not stupid, 
voted last Tuesday to stop his policies, 
which destroy jobs at home and 
weaken national defense abroad. 

On Sunday, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution 
lead editorial explained, ‘‘The 
electorate took a peach tree switch to 
the donkey’s hindquarters,’’ resulting 
in Georgia and South Carolina achieving 
returning Republican victories for 
all statewide and Federal offices for 
the first time in 136 years. 

Failed policies should stop and together 
we should work for positive 
change, such as opening Yucca Mountain 
to reduce the environmental risk 
of nuclear waste. The Boston Globe editorialized, 
‘‘Resume funding the Yucca 

Mountain project,’’ and ‘‘Democrats 
should recognize that.’’ 

Additionally, the Keystone pipeline 
should be completed to promote energy 
independence with hundreds of permanent 
jobs in my home communities 
with Michelin of Lexington and MTU of 
Graniteville. 

In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and the President should take action 
to never forget September the 11th in 
the global war on terrorism.

PROTECTING OUR RIVERWAYS 

(Mr. SMITH of Missouri asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 

Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
Missouri’s Eighth District has more 
than 200 miles of the Mississippi River 
and is dependent on barge traffic to 
move our crops. This year, with one of 
the largest harvests on record, the 
Army Corps of Engineers closed a 
stretch of the Mississippi River that 
gets the harvest to market and did not 
adequately notify shippers. 

This is absolutely unacceptable. My 
colleagues and I sent a letter this week 
urging the Corps to notify industries in 
advance of construction, and also to 
take market factors into consideration 
when planning construction in the future. 
The work the Corps does protecting 
our river system is vital, and 
we need to work to secure the Corps 
more resources to complete its mission, 
but construction must be scheduled 
appropriately and not at the expense 
of America’s farmers and shippers.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
IRAN—MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 113–172) 

The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before 
the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 

To the Congress of the United States: 

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), provides 
for the automatic termination of a national 
emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect beyond 
the anniversary date. In accordance 
with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the national 
emergency with respect to Iran 
that was declared in Executive Order 
12170 of November 14, 1979, is to continue 
in effect beyond November 14, 
2014. 

Because our relations with Iran have 
not yet returned to normal, and the

from the District of Columbia 
(Ms. NORTON) each will control 20 minutes. 


The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from California? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 

Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues 
to support the Senate amendment 
to H.R. 4194, the Government Reports 
Elimination Act of 2014. H.R. 4194 
passed the House by voice vote on April 
28, 2014, and an amended version passed 
the Senate under unanimous consent 
on September 16. I would like to personally 
take a moment to thank Senators 
CARPER and COBURN, as well as 
the Senate Homeland Security and 
Government Affairs Committee staff, 
for diligently working on getting this 
bill passed through the Senate. I would 
also like to personally thank Senators 
WARNER and AYOTTE, who introduced a 
companion bill in the Senate, for working 
with the OGR and the House Armed 
Services Committee, and others, to get 
a bill that is so broadly accepted and 
does so much to eliminate unnecessary 
and duplicative agency reports. 

The Government Reports Elimination 
Act is part of the committee’s 
effort to reduce waste and duplication 
in the Federal Government. We have 
spent more than a year working with 
each House committee vetting each 
section to ensure that useful agency reports 
are maintained. The Senate 
amendment reduces to 48 the number 
of unnecessary agency reports to Congress 
and eliminates or streamlines an 
additional five. 

Mr. Speaker, it is a good start. We 
started with a much larger report list. 
We believe that the progress under this 
bill sets the tone for an annual elimination 
of reports that have become 
outdated or unnecessary. It is very 
clear that each time the Congress 
passes a new piece of legislation—or 
even a new appropriation—there are 
questions that need to be answered and 
which the executive branch is staffed 
and funded to answer. However, most 
reports requested have no termination 
date. A single report is harmless and 
generally is accurate to the time of the 
passing, while one that goes on in perpetuity 
inevitably becomes outdated 
and, in fact, unnecessary. 

In the future, we not only want to 
continue doing this for those reports 
that have an in-perpetuity annual or 
periodic report, we also want to make 
sure, as a committee, that new report 

requirements written into any piece of 
legislation have a reauthorization or 
elimination date. We believe that is 
the only way we can cease the continuation 
of excess reports. 

Lastly, I would like to thank the 
GAO, the Congress’ government accountability 
organization. In 2013, they 
identified mandates that appeared to 
be both burdensome and unnecessary, 
and they came to the Oversight Committee 
and to our counterpart in the 
Senate with them. If not for them, we 
would not have this bill here today. 

Again, very often, the American people 
see Senators on one side and House 
Members on another taking credit for a 
vote they are about to make or have 
just made. Not often enough do we realize 
that it is not only our personal 
and committee staffs but also the 
staffs that work for Congress on a nonpartisan 
basis who are the ones, in 
fact, who generate most of the good 
things that ultimately come to this 
floor. 

Lastly, I would like to thank this administration. 
This is one area in which 
they concurred with us and helped all 
along the way to try to include as 
many reports as they could in this 
piece of legislation. 

With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 

Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
important legislation. I am pleased to 
join my colleagues in support of H.R. 
4194, the Government Reports Elimination 
Act, as amended. I also want to 
thank my good friend, Chairman DARRELL 
ISSA, for his bipartisan approach 
to this bill. This bill will bring greater 
efficiency to the overall government of 
the United States. 

Congress often requires reports from 
executive branch agencies, and these 
reports can be a valuable tool to scrutinize 
performance and assess agency 
goals. However, with the passage of 
time, reporting requirements can become 
outdated, unnecessary, or duplicative. 


Congress and the executive branch 
have recognized that improved coordination 
across the Federal Government 
benefits both the taxpayer and the government. 
In 2010, Congress passed the 
Government Performance and Results 
Modernization Act. That act requires 
the Office of Management and Budget 
to publish a list of plans or reports 
that are produced by the executive 
branch pursuant to congressional mandate. 
The act also requires the administration 
to identify potentially outdated 
or duplicative plans and reports, 
and to provide views on whether they 
should be eliminated. 

In January 2013 the Office of Management 
and Budget produced a list of 
more than 300 plans and reports that 
are potentially outdated or duplicative. 
Majority and minority staffs of 
our committee worked together to review 
this list. During this process, the 


H7910 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE November 12, 2014 

views of all other committees of jurisdiction 
were also considered. A similar 
process occurred in the Senate. 

H.R. 4194, as amended, would eliminate 
the statutory requirements to 
prepare reports that are produced by 17 
different Federal agencies. Implementing 
H.R. 4194 would reduce the administrative 
costs of these agencies by 
reducing the number of reports that 
must be prepared and printed. The Congressional 
Budget Office has estimated 
that implementing the bill would save 
about $1 million over the next 5 years. 
H.R. 4194 provides for greater efficiency 
and a more effective Federal Government. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues 
to join me in supporting this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 

Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 

Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. It is 
worth the time we have put into discussing 
it. I thank Majority Leader 
KEVIN MCCARTHY for his support on 
this bill, and I think this is a special 
opportunity to thank Congressmen 
WOODALL and CONNOLLY for their support 
as original cosponsors on this bill. 

It is amazing to me that you can 
have dozens and dozens of reports 
senselessly coming back from the administration 
that are not being read, 
not needed, are obsolete, and when you 
point it out, there is no objection 
whatsoever to eliminating them. I 
think that is exactly the situation we 
have here. 

I look forward to working with the 
majority and minority leaders’ offices 
to make sure that this is an annual 
event until we reach a point where 
there are zero pieces of reports coming 
to the Congress that are unread, unused, 
or unnecessary. 

With that, I urge passage of this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 

Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and I just wanted to join the chairman 
in his remarks about this bill. This bill 
is the quintessential efficiency bill. We 
have been doing the same thing over 
and over again until the chairman got 
the bright idea that maybe we should 
start doing this. I think we are in for 
more efficiency as more Federal agencies 
go through the same process. 

With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time. 

Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, once again, I 
urge support for the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
ISSA) that the House suspend the rules 
and concur in the Senate amendment 
to the bill, H.R. 4194. 

The question was taken. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 

Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand 
the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings 
on this motion will be postponed.

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from California? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 

Mr. Speaker, we are here today to 
consider the Senate amendment to 

H.R. 1233, the Presidential and Federal 
Records Act Amendments of 2014. This 
bill was introduced by the ranking 
member, who I see is here today, and 
was first passed by the House on January 
14 of this year. It was passed by a 
vote of 420–0. Let not a unanimous vote 
belie the fact that the ranking member 
worked hard to find consensus within 
the House and to make sure that this 
was a well-reasoned and, in fact, tailored 
piece of legislation. 
The Senate, as it often does, did 
make some changes, but ultimately 
this bill, H.R. 1233, which would codify 
existing executive order and allows 
former Presidents to appeal to incumbent 
Presidents to keep certain Presidential 
documents privileged under the 
Presidential Records Act, is the good 
work of Mr. CUMMINGS. 

This bill would lock into statute a 
process established by President 
Reagan in 1989. In 2009, President 
Obama restored this by executive 
order. However, like anything that the 
Congress has observed for a long time 
that is being done by executive order, 
the question is: Should it be on the 
whim of the next President, or should 
it, in fact, be something which statutorily 
is part of the Presidential 
Records Act, which was a statute created 
by Congress? 

I think particularly important is the 
fact that Mr. CUMMINGS recognizes that 
past Presidents, including President 
Clinton and, of course, President 
George W. Bush, do, in fact, have a 
number of things that occurred on 
their watch which remain sensitive 
today. 

b 1615 
Allowing the standing of these individuals 
and the oversight of the current 
President is a good middle ground, 
and it is one that balances the needs of 
the public, something that Mr. CUMMINGS 
and I feel strongly about, that 
transparency and freedom of information 
and access is important. 
At the same time, we recognize that 
there are times when a secret must remain 
a secret, an action must remain 
an action. It doesn’t change the fact 
that Congress may have an interest or 
the American people might prevail. 
This bill does, rightfully so and on a 
unanimous basis now in the House and 
the Senate, codify historic Federal recordkeeping. 
We believe it is good. 
I want to take a moment to thank 
Mr. CUMMINGS personally for his hard 
work. He not only championed the bill, 
but he worked well in the Senate to 
make sure it came back to us today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7911 

Mr. Speaker, I introduced the bill we 
are considering today, the Presidential 
and Federal Records Act Amendments, 
to give the American people access to 
records Presidents create while they 
are in office. 

I appreciate, first of all, the kind 
words of the chairman, and I appreciate 
the support this bill has received 
from him, Chairman ISSA, as well as 
the Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs Committee Chairman 
TOM CARPER. 

The House passed this legislation in 
January by a vote of 420–0. This bill 
also passed the Senate with no opposition. 
There are not many bills that 
make it through both House and Senate 
without even a hint of opposition, 
but this is one of them. 

When the Senate passed the House 
bill, it made technical changes that require 
us to pass the bill again. I hope 
my colleagues will join me in supporting 
this bill again, so that we can 
send it to the President for his signature. 


The bill will amend the Presidential 
Records Act by adding procedures to 
ensure that the records of Presidents 
and their senior advisers are released 
to the public in a timely manner. 

Under current law, Presidents can restrict 
access to their records for up to 
12 years after they leave office. After 
that time, Presidents may continue to 
restrict access to their records by asserting 
that they are protected by executive 
privilege. 

Under this bill, the records of current 
and former Presidents will continue to 
be protected for 12 years after they 
leave office. After that period, however, 
the bill would create a presumption 
of disclosure, and Presidents 
would have up to 90 days to object or 
those records would be automatically 
released. 

In other words, when records are requested 
more than 12 years after a 
President leaves office, this bill would 
place the burden on the President to 
review those records and either assert 
executive privilege or allow them to be 
publicly disclosed. 

This legislation would not impact the 
ability of Presidents to review their 
records before they are released. The 
legislation also would not impact the 
ability of Presidents to protect records 
because of national security concerns. 

The bill has also been amended to address 
an issue raised by the White 
House. In the original version of this 
bill, Presidents would have had 40 days 
to review records. Based on bipartisan, 
bicameral negotiations, the current 
version of the bill now extends that review 
period to 90 days. 

The Presidential and Federal Records 
Act Amendments would also require 
that any assertion of a privilege by a 
former President be affirmed by the incumbent 
President or through a court 
order for the record to be withheld 
from the public. This will provide an 
important check to ensure that Presidents 
cannot keep their records secret 
without accountability. 

The bill also includes language based 
on an amendment that Chairman DARRELL 
ISSA proposed during the committee 
markup of the bill to address 
the use of personal email by Federal 
employees, and that amendment makes 
the bill even better. 

This bill would continue to allow employees 
to use their personal email account 
for official business when necessary, 
but it would require employees 
to copy their official email account or 
forward their email to their official account. 


The Presidential and Federal Records 
Act Amendments updates the Federal 
Records Act to modernize the definition 
of what constitutes a record and 
to allow agencies to use digital reproductions 
when they are required to indefinitely 
maintain copies of documents. 


Finally, this bill is an important step 
forward in protecting our historical 
record. I urge my colleagues to support 

H.R. 1233 and send it on to the President’s 
desk. 
Again, I want to thank the chairman 
of the committee for your cooperation 
working with me over a good bit of 
time to bring this to the floor. I really 
appreciate it. 

I urge all of our Members to vote in 
favor of this bill. I think it is a good 
bill. It has been made better because 
we had the input of both sides of the 
aisle and not only both sides of the 
aisle, but also the Senate. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 

In closing, I just want to hit two 
points that I think are noteworthy. 

Historically, agencies kept their 
records for 30 years, the presumption 
they would keep them for 30 years before 
turning them over to the National 
Archives. 

With the ranking member’s assistance, 
this piece of legislation also 
eliminates that presumption. We, as a 
committee, felt very strongly that the 
sooner an agency turns over its records 
to the Archivist, the sooner they are 
broadly available and the better off it 
is. 

In an electronic era, where it is a 
push of one button to transfer data, 
this piece of legislation not only eliminates 
that presumption, but highly encourages 
data be transferred, rather 
than mountains of paper or what is 
called a PDF, a print to file, if you 
will. 

This is a significant improvement 
and something that minority and majority 
were able to work on together, 
along with the Archivist who was personally 
involved in this. 

Lastly, I owe a debt of gratitude to 
the ranking member. In this bill, the 
amendment he mentioned is included, 
but the ranking member also signed on 
to a letter asking that H.R. 5170 be 
taken up by the Senate, a more explicit 
attempt to change the recordkeeping 
outside of official use within the government. 


This has been an area in which multiple 
different Cabinet positions under 
multiple Presidents have found themselves 
with some very embarrassing 
failure to store and maintain the data. 

At the end of the day, I am confident 
that our committee, under the ranking 
member and under the chairman that 
will likely replace me, will continue 
this effort, make sure that the American 
people know that if a covered individual 
is required to keep a record of 
his or her transactions and emails, 
that it will, in fact, be in the record 
and available, not just for Congress, 
but eventually for the American people 
to see. We believe that this is an important 
part of government transparency. 


Again, I want to thank the ranking 
member who personally signed on and 
will continue, on behalf of the committee, 
to make sure that the American 
people get the full benefit of all 
records that are, in fact, created under 
any administration. 

Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge support 
for this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
ISSA) that the House suspend the rules 
and concur in the Senate amendment 
to the bill, H.R. 1233. 

The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the Senate 
amendment was concurred in. 

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. LOBIONDO) and the

each will control 20 minutes. 

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mr. LOBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous materials on H.R. 
5266. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from New Jersey? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. LOBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

First, I want to thank Mr. SHUSTER, 
Mr. GIBBS, Mr. BISHOP, and Mr. LARSEN 
for helping me bring H.R. 5266, the National 
Estuary Programs Reauthorization, 
to the floor. 

I also want to thank my colleagues, 
Mr. POSEY and Mr. MURPHY of Florida, 
in helping me get this legislation drafted 
and ushered through the committee 
in a bipartisan way. 

This version of the National Estuary 
Programs Reauthorization is fiscally 
responsible by reducing the authorization 
levels by $8 million, while ultimately 
increasing the amount of 
money each estuary program will receive. 
This reauthorization will detail 

just how the EPA is to spend the authorized 
and appropriated money. 

Unlike many programs under the 
Clean Water Act, the National Estuary 
Program is a nonregulatory program; 
instead, it is designed to support the 
collaborative voluntary efforts of Federal, 
State, and local stakeholders to 
restore degraded estuaries. 

Unfortunately, National Estuary 
Programs have been losing money due 
to the EPA administrative costs. By 
setting limits of 5 percent for administrative 
costs for the EPA, we can guarantee 
80 percent of the funding goes to 
the end user and the NEP and not bureaucratic 
salaries and red tape. 

In this year’s reauthorization, we 
have also set aside 15 percent of the 
funding for a competitive award program. 
This program will seek applications 
meant to deal with urgent and 
challenging issues that threaten the 
ecological and economic well-being of 
coastal areas. 

By structuring how the money is 
spent and lowering authorization levels, 
this legislation strikes the right 
balance of fiscal and environmental responsibilities. 
I urge all Members to 
support H.R. 5266. 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 

I rise in support of H.R. 5266 to reauthorize 
appropriations for the National 
Estuary Program. 

First, Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
recognize my committee colleagues, 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
LOBIONDO) and the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. LARSEN), for introducing 
this legislation. 

Our Nation’s coasts and oceans provide 
a wealth of resources for the entire 
country, and among these areas, 
nowhere is more valuable than estuaries. 
Estuaries are bodies of water 
that receive both water from rivers and 
saltwater from the sea. This mix 
makes a unique environment that is 
extremely productive in terms of its 
ecosystem values. 

Government studies have found that 
estuaries provide habitat for 75 percent 
of the U.S. commercial and 80 to 90 percent 
of the recreational fishing 
catches. 

Perhaps the central problem in the 
protection and restoration of estuaries 
is that they ultimately lie downstream. 
Everything that enters the 
smallest stream, tributary, or headwater 
in a watershed eventually runs 
into a single outlet, impacting in some 
way all the biological elements of that 
ecosystem and all of the commerce 
that revolves around the estuary. 

The First Congressional District of 
New York, which I have had the honor 
to represent, abuts two priority estuaries 
with the Environmental Protection 
Agency’s National Estuary Program, 
the Peconic Bay and the Long Island 
Sound. 

These unique waters are precious to 
the residents of Long Island, and their 

continued health and vitality provide 
multiple benefits to the residents of 
Long Island and to the economic and 
environmental health of the region. 

I am pleased that this legislation 
demonstrates the willingness of this 
Congress to move legislation that protects 
our water-related environment. 
The Federal seed money that comes 
from the EPA’s National Estuary Program, 
when combined with other State 
and local resources, helps to implement 
locally-driven solutions to local 
water quality challenges. 

In my view, if there are limits in the 
success of these programs, they are 
closely related to the availability of 
adequate restoration funds. 

In the 111th Congress, I was the lead 
sponsor of another bill, H.R. 4715, the 
Clean Estuaries Act of 2010, that would 
have also authorized the National Estuary 
Program, however, at higher levels 
than contained in the current bill. 

That legislation passed the House on 
a bipartisan basis and by an overwhelming 
margin; however, the Senate 
failed to ever act on that bill. 

While H.R. 5266 does represent a significant 
reduction in the authorization 
of appropriations for this important 
program, I commend the bipartisan 
sponsors of this legislation for ensuring 
that the new authorization shows some 
room to increase the funding of these 
locally-driven restoration efforts, rather 
than simply cutting those efforts. 

Too often these days, we seem driven 
to cut Federal spending for programs 
that provide real benefit to our Nation 
without an awareness of the consequences 
of these actions. 

b 1630 

I can only hope that in the years to 
come this Chamber will recognize that 
there are places where the Federal 
Government can help and should be 
making increased investments, such as 
to repair our crumbling infrastructure 
or to protect our fragile natural environment. 


These are only some of the ongoing 
challenges that face this Nation, and 
we need a Congress that is serious 
about taking on the hard questions and 
about making the right investments, 
not only for our lives and livelihoods, 
but for those generations of Americans 
to come. 

Mr. Speaker, again, I support the 
passage of H.R. 5266, and I urge my colleagues 
to also support this bill. 

I reserve the balance of my time. 

Mr. LOBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I am 
now pleased to yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. POSEY). 

Mr. POSEY. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 

I, again, want to thank Congressman 
LOBIONDO for his work on this National 
Estuary Program and this legislation 
to reauthorize this important program 
for another 5 years. 

Thank you also for working with me 
on provisions for my bill, which I introduced 
with Representative MURPHY of 
Florida—H.R. 5117, the Estuary Urgent 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7913 

Needs Priority Program. Our provision 
establishes a competitive awards program 
for estuaries to help prioritize 
funding to estuaries facing urgent 
needs. It does so without spending any 
additional money. We simply 
reprioritize and require all money appropriated 
from Congress for estuaries 
to actually be spent on estuaries. 

Mr. Speaker, the National Estuary 
Program encourages communities to 
work toward having healthy estuaries 
by providing annual base grants for 
projects to improve and to monitor the 
quality of their water and the species 
that live in them. Healthy estuaries 
provide a diverse home for flora and 
fauna. Estuaries also provide for countless 
hours of recreational enjoyment 
and billions of dollars in economic impact. 


My congressional district is home to 
one of the most diverse estuaries in the 
country, if not in the world—the Indian 
River Lagoon. Our lagoon’s natural 
beauty has always been central to our 
community as a key to improving our 
quality of life, as a recreational area 
for fishing and boating with friends and 
family, and as a significant contributor 
to our local economy. I raised my family 
along this 156-mile lagoon, and I 
know firsthand how important this legislation 
is to making our local estuary 
program a success. 

We have all seen the adverse consequences 
of sea grass loss and harmful 
algae blooms. The opportunity to compete 
for additional funding, which this 
bill provides, would be a valuable tool 
in combating the types of issues we 
have seen in our estuary. The bill before 
us redirects money away from the 
EPA’s Washington bureaucracy and toward 
actual projects and initiatives 
across the Nation’s estuaries. 

I encourage my colleagues to support 
this legislation so that we can continue 
the great work that the NEP provides 
as it facilitates estuary protection and 
restoration initiatives. 

Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. LARSEN), my 
friend. 

Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5266, 
the reauthorizing of the National Estuary 
Program. 

I want to thank Mr. GIBBS and Mr. 
BISHOP on the subcommittee and, of 
course, my colleague whom I share the 
Aviation Subcommittee with, Mr. 
LOBIONDO, for their leadership on getting 
this bill to the floor. 

Mr. Speaker, estuaries are a critical 
habitat for salmon, birds, and many 
other species in the Pacific Northwest, 
where we know that protecting our 
natural resources is good for our environment 
and good for our economy. 

My district borders on Puget Sound, 
which is our country’s second largest 
estuary and is a key driver of our economy 
in Washington State. Trade, fishing, 
tourism, and outdoor recreation in 
our region create and sustain thousands 
of jobs, and all of these activities 

are dependent on a healthy Puget 
Sound. I have long supported estuary 
restoration in the Puget Sound region, 
including projects like the Qwuloolt 
Estuary Restoration Project, which 
will be the largest tidal marsh restoration 
project ever completed in Washington 
State. 

Estuary restoration can also be a key 
component for absorbing carbon emissions 
and increasing resiliency to the 
effects of climate change. A recent 
study of the Snohomish Estuary, in my 
district, found that currently planned 
and in-construction restoration 
projects will result in at least 2.55 million 
tons of CO2 sequestered from the 
atmosphere over the next 100 years. 
That is the equivalent of a year’s 
worth of emissions from a half a million 
automobiles. This bill is important. 
It is important for all of us. 

I want to thank my colleague again, 
Mr. LOBIONDO, for his hard work on 
this legislation. I look forward to continuing 
our productive bipartisan relationship 
on this and on many other 
issues. I urge my colleagues to support 
H.R. 5266. 

Mr. LOBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I continue 
to reserve the balance of my 
time, but I do not have any more 
speakers. 

Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I thought I had one more speaker, 
but he is not here, so I yield back the 
balance of my time. 

Mr. LOBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, again, I 
thank my colleagues Mr. BISHOP, Mr. 
LARSEN, Mr. SHUSTER, and Mr. GIBBS. I 
urge all of my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this important legislation. 

I yield back the balance of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
LOBIONDO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5266, as 
amended. 

The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

H7914 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE November 12, 2014 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from North Carolina? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

S. 1934 would direct the GSA to convey 
property in Wyoming to Teton 
County, Wyoming, for fair market 
value. 
The land was originally donated to 
the Federal Government by the county 
for the purposes of a courthouse. However, 
since built, the courthouse has 
rarely been used by the Federal judiciary, 
and no other Federal use has been 
identified for this building. 

The bill would sell the building to 
the county for fair market value for 
the purposes of a county courthouse 
and county courthouse functions. Selling 
this property for fair market value 
will ensure that the taxpayers receive 
the best return on the property, and it 
will provide for the continued public 
use of the facility. 

I reserve the balance of my time. 

Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 

I rise in support of S. 1934, introduced 
by Senator JOHN BARRASSO. 

It directs the Administrator of the 
General Services Administration to 
transfer the Clifford P. Hansen Federal 
Courthouse and the land underneath to 
Teton County, Wyoming. 

The GSA has indicated to the committee 
that the agency has no need for 
the facility. This directed sale supports 
the GSA’s efforts to downsize and dispose 
of underutilized properties. However, 
this bill breaks with precedent. 
Although the local municipality is required 
to pay for the fair market value 
of the building, the bill directs the land 
underneath the building to be sold for 
a nominal value. Typically, the building 
and the land underneath would all 
be valued at a fair market value when 
being sold. 

The committee has consistently 
upheld the bipartisan principle that 
taxpayers are entitled to the full value 
of their assets in any sale. Nevertheless, 
the committee is supporting this 
unusual transaction because the underlying 
land was originally donated to 
the GSA by the local municipality, 
which is why I am supporting selling 
the land back to them for a nominal 
value. 

The bill provides taxpayers with further 
protections, Mr. Speaker. The legislation 
requires that the future use of 
this property be restricted to public 
purposes. I urge the GSA to interpret 
this language consistent with restrictions 
typically used by the GSA when 
considering land transfers for public 
purposes under title 40. 

I continue to support efforts to 
shrink the Federal footprint where appropriate 
while protecting taxpayer interests, 
and I urge Members to approve 
this legislation. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his support of this 
legislation. 

I concur with him that, in terms of 
setting a precedent, that is not something 
that we want to do. This has a 
unique set of circumstances in which 
the county actually had conveyed the 
property to the Federal Government at 
no cost. Certainly, I would agree with 
my colleague opposite that we need to 
make sure that taxpayers get the best 
return and that this does not set a 
precedent. 

Mr. Speaker, I would urge all of my 
colleagues to support this legislation 
on behalf of the American taxpayers. 

I yield back the balance of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. MEADOWS) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, S. 1934. 

The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO, FED


ERAL LAND CONVEYANCE ACT 

OF 2013 

Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 

(S. 898) to authorize the Administrator 
of General Services to convey a parcel 
of real property in Albuquerque, New 
Mexico, to the Amy Biehl High School 
Foundation. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 898 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, Federal Land Conveyance 
Act of 2013’’. 

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 

In this Act: 

(1) ADMINISTRATOR.—The term ‘‘Administrator’’ 
means the Administrator of General 
Services. 
(2) FEDERAL LAND.—The term ‘‘Federal 
land’’ means the real property located in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, that, as determined 
by the Administrator, subject to survey, generally 
consists of lots 12 through 19, and for 
the westerly boundary, the portion of either 
lot 19 or 20 which is the outside west wall of 
the basement level of the Old Post Office 
building, and which has a municipal address 
of 123 Fourth Street, SW, in Block 18, New 
Mexico Town Company’s Original Townsite, 
Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
(3) FOUNDATION.—The term ‘‘Foundation’’ 
means the Amy Biehl High School Foundation. 
SEC. 3. CONVEYANCE OF REAL PROPERTY IN ALBUQUERQUE, 
NEW MEXICO, TO THE 
AMY BIEHL HIGH SCHOOL FOUNDATION. 


(a) CONVEYANCE.—Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, not later than 90 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Administrator shall offer to convey to the 
Foundation, by quitclaim deed, all right, 
title, and interest of the United States in 
and to the Federal land. 
(b) CONSIDERATION.—As consideration for 
conveyance of the Federal land under subsection 
(a), the Administrator shall require 
the Foundation to pay to the Administrator 
consideration in an amount equal to the fair 
market value of the Federal land, as determined 
based on an appraisal that is acceptable 
to the Administrator. 
(c) COSTS OF CONVEYANCE.—The Foundation 
shall be responsible for paying— 
(1) the costs of an appraisal conducted 
under subsection (b); and 
(2) any other costs relating to the conveyance 
of the Federal land under this Act. 
(d) PROCEEDS.— 
(1) DEPOSIT.—Net proceeds received under 
subsection (b) shall be paid into the Federal 
Buildings Fund established under section 592 
of title 40, United States Code. 
(2) EXPENDITURE.—Amounts paid into the

shall provide to the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure of the 
House of Representatives and the Committee 
on Environment and Public Works of the 
Senate 30 days advance written notice of any 
expenditure of the proceeds. 
(e) ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS.—

the Administrator considers appropriate to 
protect the interests of the United States. 
(f) DEADLINE.—The conveyance of the Federal

than 3 years after the date of enactment of 
this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant 
to the rule, the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS) and the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. CARSON) 
each will control 20 minutes. 

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from North Carolina. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous materials on S. 898. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from North Carolina? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

S. 898 would direct the GSA to convey 
property in New Mexico to the 
Amy Biehl High School Foundation for 
fair market value. 
The Amy Biehl High School is a public 
charter school that has been using 
the building since 2006. While the 
school currently leases the facility 
from the General Services Administration, 
the GSA only receives a nominal 
rent, making it more costly to the taxpayers 
to maintain the property. In 
fact, the Amy Biehl Foundation has invested 
funds to renovate and restore 
the building for use as a school. The 
GSA has determined that there is no 
Federal need for the property, and it 
has concluded that the cost of managing 
the building exceeds any revenue. 
Selling this property for fair 
market value will ensure that taxpayers 
receive the best return on the 
property. 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7915 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 

I rise in support of S. 898. 

S. 898 directs the Administrator of 
the GSA to transfer the old Federal 
post office in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 
to the Amy Biehl High School 
Foundation in exchange for its fair 
market value. 
The Amy Biehl High School is a public 
charter school that is sponsored by 
the foundation that was founded in 1999 
and has been residing in the Old Post 
Office building since 2006. Currently, 
the public charter school has a long-
term lease agreement with the GSA for 
a nominal rent. The GSA has indicated 
to the committee that the agency has 
no need for the facility and that this 
directed sale supports the GSA’s efforts 
to downsize and dispose of underutilized 
properties. 

b 1645 
My own subcommittee has approved 
a nearly identical bill. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, I would also like 
to acknowledge the memory of Amy 
Biehl. Ms. Biehl was a 26-year-old Fulbright 
Scholar working in South Africa 
when she was tragically attacked and 
killed in 1993. In the aftermath, Amy’s 
parents, Linda and Peter Biehl, started 
a foundation to build on their daughter’s 
work toward peace, reconciliation, 
and multiculturalism in South 
Africa. The new school, which is located 
in New Mexico, builds on this 
great work. 
Now, approving this bill to transfer 
the building at its fair market value 
will promote Amy’s legacy and benefit 
the taxpayers. I will continue to support 
efforts by both the committee and 
the administration to reduce our Federal 
footprint. 
I support this bill, Mr. Speaker, and 
I urge my colleagues to approve it. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the gentleman for his 
support in a bipartisan manner and for 
reminding us all of the importance of 
this legacy, not only the vision of why 
this school was created but the importance 
of that mission. It is certainly a 
pleasure to work in a bipartisan way 
with the gentleman. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 5 minutes to the gentlelady 
from New Mexico, Madam LUJAN GRISHAM. 
Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of 
New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to thank my colleagues, both Representative 
CARSON from Indiana and 
my colleague from North Carolina (Mr. 
MEADOWS), for their support on S. 898. 
As you have just heard, this is a companion 
bill to a nearly identical bill, 
my bill H.R. 3998, which passed this 
body on June 17. 
Now, we have also heard that this 
bill is to sell a Federal building at fair 

market value which costs more in its 
current lease arrangement than it does 
in this transaction and arrangement. 
You have also heard that this is an incredible 
school, memorializing an incredible 
legacy. 

But what you haven’t heard today is 
that the foundation has raised more 
than $3 million to continue to invest 
not only in the purchase of the building 
but to expand their educational 
footprint in New Mexico. 

In my district in Albuquerque, we 
have difficulties reaching out to a 
high-poverty, high at-risk high school 
group. This school has incredible outcomes. 
They are seeing a 100 percent 
graduation rate, 80 percent graduation 
rates out of college; and of that 80 percent, 
nearly all of those students continue 
a very aggressive community relationship. 
Part of this school’s requirement 
is that not only do you meet 
your basic high school curriculum but 
you have to invest considerably in 
community work in a variety of nonprofit 
and charitable work. 

I want to also give a special thanks 
and extend my gratitude to Senator 
TOM UDALL for working with me on 
this bill and to Chairman SHUSTER and 
Ranking Member RAHALL for their help 
in bringing the legislation to the floor. 

With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill that 
helps the Amy Biehl High School to 
continue to provide Albuquerque students 
with a first-rate education while 
also preserving a historic piece of 
downtown Albuquerque. 

Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I will 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 

Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 4 minutes to my good friend 
from Florida, Representative MURPHY. 

Mr. MURPHY of Florida. I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 

Mr. Speaker, I support the bill before 
us and appreciate the hard work of my 
colleagues to bring it to the floor. 

Today I join my colleagues in speaking 
in support of reauthorizing the National 
Estuary Program because our 
local economy on the Treasure Coast 
and Palm Beaches rely on healthy 
water. 

This important program helps protect 
and improve some of our Nation’s 
most at-risk waterways, including the 
Indian River Lagoon located in the district 
I am proud to represent, which 
has been devastated by toxic algae in 
recent years, negatively impacting not 
only the health of this unique ecosystem 
but also our local economy. 

The National Estuary Program funds 
local projects that help improve water 
quality, protect threatened species, 
and coordinate local agencies to respond 
to other urgent needs. 

In our own backyard, these projects 
include wetland restoration, shellfish 
rehabilitation, freshwater discharge 
management, and other approaches 
that benefit the health of our local waterways 
on the Treasure Coast and 
across the Nation. 

I am very pleased to see a competitive 
award program included in this 
bill that I proposed, along with the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. POSEY), 
to help estuaries most at risk where reoccurring 
harmful algal blooms, sea 
grass loss, and invasive species are 
threatening the fragile ecology of these 
important water systems. 

I hope my colleagues will continue to 
support this effective program not only 
because of its benefits to sustaining 
important estuaries across the country 
but also due to the urgent need to address 
the serious problems facing many 
of these waterways, including the Indian 
River Lagoon, the most diverse estuary 
in the United States. 

Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for 
coming together and acting so swiftly 
to reauthorize this bipartisan and cost-
effective bill that is necessary for our 
country’s coastal ecosystems and the 
economies that rely on their well-
being. I hope the Senate will act expeditiously 
to do the same. 

Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time at this 
point, and I am prepared to close. 

I reserve the balance of my time. 

Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 

Mr. MEADOWS. I thank the gentleman 
for his bipartisan effort to 
make sure that this important piece of 
legislation gets passed, and I urge all of 
my colleagues to support it. 

With that, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. MEADOWS) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, S. 898. 

The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 

A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

WELCOMING THE HONORABLE 

DONALD W. NORCROSS TO THE 

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) is recognized for 1 minute. 

There was no objection. 

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate and welcome our 
new colleague to the New Jersey delegation, 
Congressman DONALD NORCROSS. 
Now, let me tell you that you 
will all learn to love DONALD NORCROSS 
the way I have. 

He comes from a union background, 
and he is a fighter. He always fights for 
the little guy. He also is bipartisan. He 
wants to work with the Republican 
side to get legislation passed, as he did 
in the State senate, and he has the reputation 
in the State senate, where we 
chaired one of the committees, of actually 
passing legislation. 

I just want you to get to know him 
well. As I said, you will learn to love 
him. He will be a great Congressman, 
and you will learn over the next few 

years how effective he can be. 

Congratulations again, DONALD. 

I yield to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. LOBIONDO). 

Mr. LOBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I join 
in with congratulations to DONALD 
NORCROSS. I have known DONALD for a 
number of years as a State legislator, 
and before that, we worked together at 
a local level. 

DONALD will always put his constituents 
first. He will always put his district 
first. He will be a great asset to 
this Congress, and I look forward to 
working with you, DONALD. Congratulations. 


Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, Leader 
PELOSI, Congressman PALLONE, and 
certainly Congressman LOBIONDO and 
my colleagues from New Jersey. The 
young man who is standing next to me 
is my grandson, Donald III, who did an 
excellent job; and a special person in 
my life who allows me and keeps my 
life in order, my lovely wife, Andrea. 

She is up there with my daughter, 
Corey; my son, Gregory; my son, Donald, 
Jr.; his wife, Jeanette; and my 
granddaughter, Natalie. It is great to 
have you here. And the one person who 
is truly the leader of my house is my 
mother, Carol. Hey, Ma. 

And many friends, family, and supporters 
from New Jersey, including my 
three brothers, George, John, and Phil; 
and my extended brother, Robert—it is 
good to have you here. 

To my extended family in labor who 
I have worked closely with over the 
past 25 years and certainly the supporters 
and volunteers who have 
worked with us over the past 10 
months, many thanks. 

Life always brings us so many twists 
and turns. You never know where you 
are going to be. I grew up in the profession 
as an electrician, and look where 
we are now, a Member of the House. 

This is truly the American Dream, 
and I am proud to be a part of it, and 
I look forward to working with all of 
my colleagues on behalf of this great 
Nation and the people who live in it. 
Thank you very much. 


H7918 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE November 12, 2014 

WELCOMING THE HONORABLE 

ALMA S. ADAMS TO THE HOUSE 

OF REPRESENTATIVES 

The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. COBLE) is recognized for 1 minute. 

There was no objection. 

Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, colleagues, 
Representative ADAMS has served our 
area in the North Carolina General Assembly 
in excess of two decades. In Raleigh, 
she is known as the ‘‘legislative 
lady with the hat.’’ 

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present 
to you and to my colleagues the legislative 
lady with the hat, ALMA ADAMS 
from North Carolina. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE). 

Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the dean of our delegation, 
HOWARD COBLE, for yielding, 
and I want to add to his words of introduction 
for our new colleague, ALMA 
ADAMS. 

She was elected this past election to 
fill the unexpired term of our colleague 
Mel Watt, who has taken the leadership 
of the Federal Housing Finance 
Agency. She represents the 12th Congressional 
District of North Carolina. 

ALMA ADAMS was born in High Point, 
North Carolina. She attended college 
at North Carolina A&T University. She 
got her Ph.D. from Ohio State University, 
and she became a teacher. She 
had a 40-year career as a professor at 
Bennett College in North Carolina. 

ALMA ADAMS’ career in politics began 
on the Greensboro school board. She 
served on the city council. She was appointed 
to the general assembly in 1994 
by Governor Jim Hunt and then was 
elected in her own right for successive 
terms. She has had a distinguished 
term of service in our general assembly. 


She is known for her unceasing desire 
to improve the lives of women and children 
and families. Her issues include 
domestic violence, teenage pregnancy, 
affordable health care, and public education. 
She chaired the Legislative 
Black Caucus. She also chaired the bipartisan 
Women’s Legislative Caucus. 

So ALMA ADAMS, my colleagues, 
comes to us very, very well-equipped to 
be a productive and constructive and 
cooperative Member of this body, and 
it is my honor and pleasure to introduce 
you to her tonight, ALMA ADAMS. 

Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman COBLE, Congressman 
PRICE. As we all know, the journey to 
Congress is not made alone, and I could 
not have made it here without my 
faith, my family, and my friends. 

So I want to take a moment to give 
special thanks to my mother who could 
not be here today; to my children, 
Billy, Jeanele; and my son-in-law, Ty; 
to my four grandchildren, one who is 
on the floor with me tonight; to my 
siblings; and to everyone who made the 
trip to share in this momentous occasion 
with me. 

I stand here on the shoulders of the 
fearless women who shattered the glass 

ceiling by coming to Congress and representing 
our country with pride, tenacity, 
and integrity. It is with great 
honor that I stand before you tonight 
as the 100th woman in the 113th Congress. 
The women who have served before 
me have proven that when women 
succeed, we all succeed. 

As I traveled across the 12th Congressional 
District, I heard the calls for us 
to work together, to create jobs, invest 
in education, and to be a voice for the 
working men and women struggling to 
make ends meet. 

I am answering their calls by pledging 
to work with the Members of the 
North Carolina delegation and each 
and every Member of this Chamber. To 
the people of the 12th Congressional 
District, 10 months of no representation 
stops now. I am here, and I am 
rolling up my sleeves, and I am getting 
to work. 

f 

WELCOMING THE HONORABLE 

DAVE BRAT TO THE HOUSE OF 

REPRESENTATIVES 

The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
GOODLATTE) is recognized for 1 minute. 

There was no objection. 

Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to welcome the newest 
Member of the House of Representatives 
from Virginia, Dr. DAVE BRAT of 
Glen Allen, Virginia, to this Chamber. 

DAVE is joining this body as a new 
Member representing the Seventh District 
of Virginia. Over the past year, he 
has talked with his friends and neighbors 
about the challenges facing our 
Nation and what Congress can do to 
help grow our economy and help the 
private sector create jobs. 

DAVE is uniquely positioned to work 
on issues related to American jobs and 
the economy. With an undergraduate 
degree in business administration and 
a Ph.D. in economics, his background 
in economic policy will help this body 
deal with the most pressing issues of 
the day. 

For the past 18 years, DAVE has been 
a faculty member at Randolph-Macon 
College where he served as the chair of 
the department of economics. DAVE is 
also a strong family man and, with his 
wife, Laura, has two children. 

Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to welcome 
DAVE to the United States House 
of Representatives. Joining us today 
are our fellow Members of the Virginia 
delegation who welcome you and look 
forward to working with you. 

I now yield to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) for his welcoming 
remarks. 

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to welcome Congressman 
DAVE BRAT to the people’s House and 
to the Virginia delegation. Our congressional 
delegation has a long history 
of working together. Our former 
longtime dean, Senator John Warner, 
set the standard for working together 
in a constructive manner. 

While we may not always agree on 
every issue, we will always try to work 

together for what is best for Virginia 
and our Nation. It is the Virginia way. 

DAVE will be replacing Majority 
Leader ERIC CANTOR, and at the end of 
this Congress, our delegation will also 
lose two of its more senior Members, 
FRANK WOLF and JIM MORAN. 

With their departure, our delegation’s 
clout may wane a bit, but I know 
it will be reinvigorated by new Members 
like Congressman BRAT, committed 
to working together for our 
Commonwealth. 

Mr. Speaker, Dave comes to Congress 
after a career as an economics professor 
at Randolph-Macon College. He 
has been appointed to State boards and 
commissions by several Virginia Governors, 
including the Joint Advisory 
Board of Economists. I know he will 
put these experiences to good use. 

I welcome DAVE and his family to 
Congress, and I look forward to working 
with him on issues critical to the 
Richmond region and the entire Commonwealth 
of Virginia. 

b 1915 
Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, thank you 
to my new colleagues and thank you to 
the people of Virginia’s Seventh District 
who have entrusted me with the 
honor of serving as their Representative, 
and many of them are with us tonight 
in the gallery. Thank you for 
coming. 
We are proud that the Seventh District 
is the home of the father of the 
Constitution, James Madison, and the 
voice of the Revolution, Patrick Henry. 
It has been a long road, and very few 
gave me a chance when the journey 
began. I want to thank my wife, Laura, 
and my children, Jonathan and Sophia, 
for believing in me. And I want to 
thank God, as this would not have been 
possible without His assistance along 
the way. 
Throughout my campaign, as President 
Reagan said, I tried to appeal to 
people’s best hopes and not their worst 
fears. I strived to elevate the dialogue 
and focus us on solutions, especially on 
the economic issues facing our country. 
That is how I will approach the 
weighty responsibility with which I 
have been entrusted. 
Thank you all, God bless you all, and 
may God continue to bless this great 
Nation.

asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, today Congress returns to 
session with little time to complete 
business on a range of important matters, 
which is why I am calling on the 
Senate to take swift action on the National 
Defense Authorization Act. 
The NDAA, which passed the House 
in May, authorizes policy for the Pentagon, 
and this year included reforms 
to ensure our troops are more adequately 
trained and equipped, both 
mentally and physically. 
A recent Army study found that 
nearly half the soldiers who reported 
suicide attempts indicated their first 
attempt was prior to enlistment. And I 
am proud to say the House version of 
the NDAA includes provisions identical 
to the Medical Evaluation Parity for 
Servicemembers Act, or MEPS Act, 
that I introduced earlier in the year. 
That will help address this challenge. 
The MEPS Act enables the Pentagon 
to establish a baseline to properly 
track changes in the servicemembers’ 
behavioral health by instituting a requirement 
that all incoming troops undergo 
a mental health assessment upon 
enlistment. 
It is time for the Senate to act on 
this bipartisan legislation that has the 
support of over 40 veterans’ and military 
advocacy groups.

SIGMA GAMMA RHO FOUNDERS 
DAY 

(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 

Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize my sorority, 
Sigma Gamma Rho, which today 
proudly celebrates 92 years of service. 

Established in 1922 at Butler University, 
Sigma Gamma Rho engrained in 
me and countless women the value of 
public service. Sisters include former 
Congresswoman Lindy Boggs, the first 
woman to represent Louisiana; my colleague, 
the Honorable Congresswoman 
CORRINE BROWN of Florida; Hattie 
McDaniel, the first African American 
woman to receive an Academy Award; 
and our Grand Basileus, Bonitta Herring. 


Sigma Gamma Rho played an integral 
role in the civil rights movement, 
as members fought to overturn Jim 
Crow laws and advance women’s equality. 


Today Sigma Gamma Rho continues 
their service in promoting education 
and awareness in communities on 
issues like health equality and financial 
literacy. 

For 92 years, Sigma Gamma Rho has 
been on the front lines of making our 
Nation better through scholarship, sisterhood, 
and service. I am honored to 
be a part of this legacy and wish many 
more years of success to my sisters in 
Sigma Gamma Rho.

STUNNING CONTEMPT FOR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE 

(Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, everyone 
remembers the promise the President 
made while promoting his health 
care law: ‘‘If you like your health care 
plan, you can keep it.’’ He broke his 
promise. 

We just learned that one of the law’s 
chief architects, Professor Jon Gruber, 
has come clean and admitted the deceit 
used to get the law passed. But Professor 
Gruber also revealed a stunning 
contempt for the American people. He 
called us stupid. 

This reminds me of when Lucy was 
trying to get Charlie Brown to kick the 
football. Charlie says to Lucy, ‘‘I don’t 
mind your dishonesty half as much as 
I mind your opinion of me.’’ 

In this case, Mr. Speaker, the American 
people mind both the administration’s 
dishonesty and its opinion of 
them. 

The professor now regrets his comments. 
But does he regret that my constituents, 
Don and Karen of Johnstown, 
Pennsylvania, and millions of 
other Americans have lost their health 
care plan because of ObamaCare? Does 
he regret that steelworkers in Beaver 
County, Pennsylvania, and countless 
others are seeing their health insurance 
premiums skyrocket? 

More importantly, Mr. Speaker, does 
the President regret it?

IN HONOR OF VETERANS DAY 
(Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the extraordinary service 
and selfless sacrifice of our Nation’s 
veterans. 
Each year, on the 11th day of the 11th 
month, we pause to pay tribute to our 
veterans, the men and women who 
served this country with honor and distinction. 
To the almost 22 million veterans in 
the United States and the 43,000 veterans 
who live in my congressional district, 
I am here to say thank you for 
your service and sacrifice. You answered 
the call of service and never 
wavered. 
Whether at home or abroad, whether 
at war or at times of peace, you kept 
our Nation safe and protected our freedoms. 
In gratitude and humility, it is 
now our turn to serve you, providing 
the benefits and the resources you deserve 
and earned. 

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today, 
NATO’s Commander Breedlove said in 
Bulgaria, ‘‘We have seen columns of 
Russian equipment, primarily Russian 
tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air 
defense systems, and Russian combat 
troops entering into Ukraine.’’ In response, 
Ukraine has redeployed troops 
to the east to counter the insurgency. 
But these soldiers are severely under-
supplied. 
Ukraine had an election just a couple 
of weeks ago, the most transparent, 
the most free, and the most pro-Western 
election in history. But pro-Russian 
parliamentarians received less 
than 10 percent of the vote. 
Today, once again, Ukraine faces 
war, as the ceasefire there collapsed as 
Russia attempts to reassert its influence 
by sinister and illegal means. 
Ukraine’s young soldiers don’t have 
proper boots or weapons or defensive 
equipment. How many times must 
Ukraine be invaded before we call it an 
invasion? 
I call upon the House to pass H.R. 
5190, the bill I introduced with my fellow 
Ukrainian Caucus cochair, JIM 
GERLACH of Pennsylvania, to provide 
meaningful humanitarian aid and security 
assistance to Ukraine. The Senate 
has passed S. 2828 that does much the 
same. 
Let us stop the advance of this tyranny 
in the new century. Liberty is 
calling. Let us measure up in this 
lameduck session.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE 
HONORABLE HOWARD COBLE 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COLLINS 
of New York). Under the Speaker’s 
announced policy of January 3, 2013, 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. FOXX) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the majority leader. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the subject 
of my Special Order. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina? 

There was no objection. 

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, we are here 
tonight to pay tribute to the dean of 
the North Carolina delegation and our 
beloved colleague of many years, HOWARD 
COBLE. 

HOWARD COBLE has been a dedicated 
public servant to the people of North 
Carolina and a champion for honest, effective 
government. For three decades, 
he has taken great care to represent 
the values and concerns of Sixth District 
residents. 

b 1930 
It is a profound honor to call HOWARD 
a dear friend, and it saddens me to 


H7920 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE November 12, 2014 

think about coming here in the next 
Congress without his wisdom or signature 
wit. 

Wearing his trademark plaid jackets, 
HOWARD has been a champion for his 
constituents, whether in Washington 
or back in North Carolina. He never 
backed down from a challenge to do 
what was right for North Carolina and 
always pushed Washington to work 
better for those he represented. 

Always ready with a cheerful greeting 
and a welcoming smile for whoever 
crossed his path, it is clear HOWARD 
cares about the little details that mean 
so much to average North Carolinians. 
Those who met him know of his characteristic 
penchant for inquiring about 
their alma mater and then rattling off 
the corresponding mascot. 

Perhaps the most fitting summary of 
HOWARD’s personality is that he is the 
essence of what it means to be a southern 
gentleman: someone who simply 
exudes kindness, charm, and compassion. 
And let’s not forget that he was 
named the sexiest bachelor in Congress 
by BuzzFeed earlier this year. 

HOWARD is also known for his deadpan 
humor, and loves a good joke, even 
if it is at his own expense. However, 
that wit can sometimes be a two-edged 
sword. In 2008, his sense of humor almost 
killed someone. At the North 
Carolina GOP Convention he cracked a 
joke to ROBERT PITTENGER, who now 
represents North Carolina’s Ninth Congressional 
District. ROBERT nearly expired 
after choking on his meal in mid-
chuckle. Reliable sources have hinted 
that the joke might have been a variation 
of HOWARD’s ‘‘feisty mountain 
woman’’ one-liner that he routinely 
uses to describe me. Fortunately, 
former Presidential candidate Governor 
Mike Huckabee was there to rescue 
ROBERT from HOWARD’s humor with 
a well-placed Heimlich maneuver. 

All kidding aside, HOWARD is a man 
of integrity and principle, a Representative 
who has stood for what is right 
and who has fought on behalf of what 
makes America a great Nation. 

Today, I salute HOWARD COBLE, my 
friend, for his many years of service. 
We will miss him greatly. 

With that, Mr. Speaker, I now yield 
to our colleague, Mr. PRICE. 

Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
yielding and for scheduling this Special 
Order here on our first night back in 
town for the very important purpose of 
paying tribute to our dear friend and 
colleague, HOWARD COBLE. I am very 
happy to join in this, as many other 
colleagues will be tonight as well. 

I have served with HOWARD since I 
first arrived here in 1987. He had beaten 
me by 2 years. He was first elected in 
1984 to represent North Carolina’s 
Sixth District. 

I think when you hear the tributes 
tonight from both sides of the aisle you 
are going to, quite accurately, conclude 
that HOWARD COBLE is one of the 
best-liked Members of this body, and 
that affection extends across the entire 
political spectrum. 

HOWARD is always ready with a kind 
word for everyone, from fellow Representatives 
to Capitol Police and constituents. 
It is difficult to walk anywhere 
with HOWARD in Washington, 
D.C., or in North Carolina without 
being stopped several times because he 
has so many friends who just want to 
catch up with him. 

I have always especially enjoyed introducing 
my staff to HOWARD. His first 
question usually is: ‘‘What high school 
did you go to?’’ And then the second 
question is something like: ‘‘What’s it 
like working for this scallywag?’’ 

We’ve sometimes disagreed, of 
course, on politics and policy, but we 
have had many, many occasions for 
fruitful collaboration and cooperation 
on issues important to North Carolina. 
We have worked for years, for example, 
on promoting textile research. We have 
certainly worked on disaster relief 
after several major hurricanes. Over 
the years, I have come to appreciate 
HOWARD as a smart and able legislator, 
and, more than that, I have come to 
value him as a person and to value his 
friendship. 

My district staff would want me to 
add how much we all admire HOWARD’s 
constituent service. When it comes to 
working with our constituents in dealing 
with Federal agencies, party lines 
don’t matter. Often, the district lines 
are a little indistinct and we have to 
figure out whose district someone is in 
or get a case referred back and forth. 
HOWARD’s staff is invariably cooperative 
and competent. It is not an accident 
that he has a superb reputation in 
North Carolina for the best constituent 
service around. 

HOWARD has been a dedicated Member 
in this body in Washington as well. 
He has been an effective legislator, especially 
distinguishing himself in his 
leadership positions on the Judiciary 
Committee. He has done all this with a 
certain grace and style. He reminds us 
of a time when our politics were less 
hard-edged. 

So as he retires at the close of the 
current Congress, we wish him all the 
best. He leaves this body with immense 
affection and respect. Our State and 
the House of Representatives have 
greatly benefited from the service of 
HOWARD COBLE. 

Godspeed, my friend. 

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 
to our colleague, Mr. JONES. 

Mr. JONES. I thank Ms. FOXX for 
putting this together. Tonight is a sad 
night, but a very special night, I think, 
for those of us who have had the privilege 
to know HOWARD COBLE as long as 
I have. We go back to 1983, when I was 
a freshman Democrat in the North 
Carolina House of Representatives and 
he was a member of the North Carolina 
House of Representatives as a Republican. 
Why we met, I don’t know, but 
eventually we became pretty good 
friends at that point. He then left the 
North Carolina House and came to 
Washington, D.C., and my father, Congressman 
Walter Jones, Sr., was chair


man of the Merchant Marine Committee. 
Mr. COBLE, who came from 
North Carolina, was on that committee 
because he is a former member of the 
Coast Guard. He was a natural because 
of the work they did on that committee. 
My father became a friend of 
HOWARD COBLE’s. Then I came to Washington, 
Mr. Speaker, as a Republican, 
and we have been friends for many 
years. 

This man, to me, is very special as a 
human being. I heard Mr. PRICE say the 
‘‘dean,’’ but I call him the ‘‘leadah’’, l-
e-a-d-a-h. Mr. COBLE likes to tell people 
that is because those of us from eastern 
North Carolina don’t know the 
word ‘‘leader’’ ends in e-r instead of a-

h. I did that because at the time we became 
the majority in 1995, it was a 
change in the House, for sure, and 
there was a Democrat for a number of 
years, and Mr. COBLE, being the kind of 
man he was, said, ‘‘No, I don’t want to 
be called the dean. As long as he’s here 
in Congress, I want him to remain the 
dean.’’ I think that says a heck of a lot 
about who this person is. So, Mr. 
Speaker, I decided that he should be 
known as the ‘‘leadah,’’ and therefore 
many people in the House of Representatives 
from both parties call him the 
‘‘leadah’’—some with a northern accent, 
some with a west coast accent, 
but it still sounds the same. 
For me, personally, this night is sad 
because I have spent many nights in 
the last few years where Mr. COBLE and 
I have had dinner together at the Capitol 
Hill Club reminiscing about yesterday 
but also thinking about today. For 
me, this is a personal relationship that 
is like family, quite frankly. For me to 
know that I have been reelected for another 
term and to know that Mr. COBLE 
will go back home and enjoy the love 
and affection of the people of Greensboro, 
it still is sad for me personally. I 
do think that he has given so much not 
only to the State of North Carolina, 
but to our Nation. He has been a very 
effective leader of the House. He has 
been a great legislator. He has been 
able to get things done in the Judiciary 
Committee and other committees. He 
will always be remembered in my heart 
as a member of my family. 

To you, HOWARD COBLE, I love you as 
a brother in Christ. You are a special 
man who has given so much to not only 
North Carolina, but to America. You 
will always remain a member of my 
family. God bless you, sir. 

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 
to our esteemed colleague from eastern 
North Carolina (Mr. MCINTYRE). 

Mr. MCINTYRE. Thank you, HOWARD, 
for your spirit, service, and standard of 
statesmanship. 

HOWARD and I have had a spirit of 
friendship that has been something we 
have always enjoyed together here on 
the floor. He has often asked me about 
what the latest score was or when the 
next game is that our beloved Tar 
Heels were playing in any sport—not 
just football and basketball but baseball 
and many other sports the team 
engages in. 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7921 

But our spirit has gone even beyond 
that great school spirit and congressional 
spirit that we share to the spirit 
we have shared in our Lord and how 
God has touched our lives, and the fellowship 
together that we have had 
right across the hall in the Congressional 
Prayer Caucus and even on the 
steps of the Capitol here one evening 
several years ago. I am sure you remember 
that we shared that together, 
HOWARD. 

Second is his service. In addition to 
his spirit of friendship and friendliness 
to so many people and the spirit that 
we have shared in our Lord is his longevity 
of service that he has given. But 
it hasn’t just been mundane or in-and-
out service. It has been a service done 
with life, laughter, and with latitude. 
He has life in what he does. He always 
shares a smile and makes you laugh 
and not take things so seriously that 
you can’t enjoy what you are doing. We 
all should be able to enjoy this great 
opportunity of service. 

He also takes the latitude to spend 
time with you and the latitude to literally 
work across the aisle, as symbolized 
by the comments you have already 
heard tonight and the friendships that 
he has across the aisle. 

Third, with that spirit and service is 
also his standard of statesmanship. 

HOWARD, I think about when we flew 
together with the Commandant of the 
Coast Guard. You being a Coastie yourself, 
we often talked about the importance 
of the Coast Guard and how we 
know it serves us well in North Carolina 
and nationwide. We flew down 
with the Commandant on his plane, 
and HOWARD came down to my district 
to honor Wilmington as the Nation’s 
first Coast Guard city on the east 
coast. We shared that time together. 

He was that kind of person that 
would travel and spend time with you. 
And whether it was on the coast in Wilmington 
or whether it was on the 
pitching mound together, as he and I 
and Representatives Foxx and PRICE 
shared at our alma mater, UNC Chapel 
Hill, just this past spring, he knew always 
how to show that friendship and 
to show that standard of statesmanship 
in every situation. 

Thank you, HOWARD, for always 
bringing people together. With your 
disarming smile and your friendship 
you have shown what exemplary 
statesmanship is all about. You have 
shown that spirit of fellowship and 
friendship. You have given that longevity 
of service. Most of all, you have 
shown that standard of statesmanship 
to which we all should ascribe. 

God bless you, my friend, my Christian 
brother, and my fellow Tar Heel. 
Thank you so much. 

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 
to the Congresswoman from North 
Carolina, Congresswoman ELLMERS. 

Mrs. ELLMERS. I am honored to 
stand before you to speak on behalf of 
my dear friend, the dean of our delegation, 
HOWARD COBLE. He has been a 
source of wisdom, an esteemed col


league, and a loyal friend to all since 
taking office in 1985. 

One of the fondest memories that I 
have of HOWARD was when I had the 
privilege of watching him accept the 
Bertholf Award. This prestigious honor 
was awarded to HOWARD for his unwavering 
support of the brave men and 
women serving in the United States 
Coast Guard. When I arrived at the 
ceremony, I wasn’t surprised to find 
the committee room packed from wall 
to wall. Seating was scarce, and there 
was hardly any standing room left for 
supporters. Everyone was there to show 
support and appreciation for our good 
friend HOWARD, just as he has been 
there to show support and appreciation 
over the years to all of us. 

While speaking at the ceremony, Admiral 
Papp shared some words of advice 
that HOWARD once gave him: 

Always take care of your shipmates. 

b 1945 
HOWARD, you have truly embodied 
this piece of advice through your service 
in Congress, especially when taking 
care of your constituents. 
You have always taken care of each 
of us, your shipmates, through both 
your dedicated service and loyal friendship. 
On a personal note, I have had the incredible 
honor of following HOWARD in 
representing Moore and Randolph 
Counties in District Two, and I must 
say, you are truly loved and respected, 
and I have very big shoes to continue 
to fill. 
Your retirement marks the end of an 
era here in Congress, but launches the 
beginning of another incredible journey 
for you. I wish you a long and relaxing 
retirement, and I will be forever 
grateful for your friendship and guidance 
through the years. 
Thank you. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
our colleague from North Carolina, 
RICHARD HUDSON. 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, you may 
notice my sharp jacket tonight. It is a 
madras jacket worn in honor of my 
dear friend and colleague, HOWARD 
COBLE. 
HOWARD was not always known for 
just his colorful jackets. Back when he 
first came to town, HOWARD COBLE was 
known for his many colorful suspenders. 
In fact, I don’t know how 
many he had, but it was well-known 
that he would always have those 
bright, colorful suspenders on. 
Next he became known for wearing 
distinctive hats. In fact, in the nineties, 
Tim Russert used to refer to HOWARD 
COBLE as ‘‘the man with the hat.’’ 
Then it was Tim Russert’s son, Luke, 
who first noticed the madras jackets a 
few years ago, and he actually put on 
his Twitter account that the jacket 
HOWARD COBLE is wearing tonight 
looked like ‘‘an exploding turtle.’’ 
So the Russert family has long acknowledged 
HOWARD’s unique sense of 
style, as have many of his constituents 
and his friends here in Congress. 

HOWARD COBLE has been known for 
his sense of humor. He once remarked 
that if he put on a brandnew suit, it 
would immediately look rumpled like 
an unmade bed. 

HOWARD has always had a self-deprecating 
humor and a personality that 
draws people to him. Everyone loves 
him. I learned that as a candidate for 
Congress, Mr. Speaker, because I inherited 
three counties from HOWARD 
COBLE’s former district, so when I 
would go ask people for votes, I had to 
immediately tell them I wasn’t running 
against HOWARD COBLE because, 
otherwise, they didn’t want to talk to 
me. 

HOWARD COBLE is legendary in his 
constituent services. He has always 
taken care of his constituents. They 
know they have a friend in their Congressman 
HOWARD COBLE. 

He set a standard, Mr. Speaker, to 
which we can all aspire to in terms of 
the integrity with which he has conducted 
himself, the love for people that 
everyone knows and can sense and is 
drawn to, and the constituent service. 

Mr. Speaker, it has been a privilege 
to get to know HOWARD COBLE. It has 
been an honor to serve with him, and I 
call him friend. I will miss seeing him 
in Congress every day, but I know that 
he will not be a stranger. 

I just say, God bless you, HOWARD 
COBLE, and Godspeed. 

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
our distinguished colleague from North 
Carolina (Mr. PITTENGER). 

Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, much 
has been said and written about the 
ratings of the United States Congress 
and the approval of what the American 
people think of us. It is somewhere 
right around 10 percent. 

Let me tell you those ratings don’t 
take into consideration HOWARD COBLE. 
My esteemed friend in this Congress is 
regarded by his own constituents as a 
family member. 

HOWARD COBLE chose not to be married, 
but what became his family were 
his constituents. What became his 
friends were his colleagues in Congress. 
Both sides of the aisle love HOWARD. 

I am one, Congressman COBLE, who 
loved seeing you out there on that 
back row every time I walked in, with 
a big smile and a good story, and everybody 
would come by and say hello 
to HOWARD during the course of the session, 
just to see you, because you are 
special to all of us. 

Yes, my good friend, Congresswoman 
FOXX, did tell a story about how my 
life was spared as I was chewing some 
chicken, and I realized I couldn’t chew 
and laugh at the same time as I tried 
to swallow that chicken, and then here 
came Mr. Huckabee to give me the 
Heimlich and save my life. 

Well, you know, I was in a primary a 
year after that. It was 11 people in the 
primary, and the one good thing about 
that is I got a sympathy vote from 
Mike Huckabee, and he endorsed me, so 
that was a good thing. 

HOWARD, thank you. Thank you for 
being committed in your job. On the 


H7922 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE November 12, 2014 

Judiciary Committee, on the Transportation 
Committee, you were faithful in 
every respect, to do the right thing for 
North Carolina, for your district and, 
frankly, for the American people. 

We are all in debt to you for your 
service to this great country. Our 
country is better off today because of 
the life of HOWARD COBLE. 

Thank you. God bless you. 

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the distinguished gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. GOODLATTE), chairman of the 
Judiciary Committee. 

Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentlewoman 
for yielding. 

Mr. Speaker, it is just a real honor to 
be here tonight to tell my friend, HOWARD 
COBLE, how much he means to me 
and how much I am going to miss him 
here in the House of Representatives. 

He has not only been an outstanding 
leader on the House Judiciary Committee—
and by the way, I hope the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
JONES) will compile all those wonderful 
photographs and put them in some 
kind of a binder so that—a book 
maybe, so that all of us can see and 
enjoy all those historic caricatures 
that have been created in HOWARD’s 
honor over these many years—but not 
only has he been a great member of the 
House Judiciary Committee, he has 
been a close personal friend of mine for 
more than 20 years. 

In addition to serving with him on 
the committee, he is somebody who is 
always turning to others, taking an interest 
in them. He has an uncanny ability 
to remember the mascots for virtually 
any high school or college that 
someone attended and his ability to always 
ask others how they are feeling. 

With respect to this last point, he 
has defused more than a few difficult 
conversations by asking people, ‘‘How 
is your back feeling?’’ Inevitably, especially 
if someone is older, they begin to 
talk about back problems and forget 
what they were so exercised about. 

He is also a great tennis player. For 
nearly 20 years, I have had the honor of 
playing tennis with him very early on 
Wednesday mornings. HOWARD isn’t 
known for moving around the court 
really fast, but the thing about him is 
he always was there where you hit the 
ball, and he always put it back just exactly 
where he wanted it to go, an 
amazing accomplishment. So HOWARD, 
thank you very much for that. 

I want to tell one story in conjunction 
with a field hearing that took 
place in Nashville—HOWARD is a great 
fan of bluegrass music and country 
music in general—a field hearing that 
took place in Nashville when the Fairness 
in Music Licensing bill was under 
consideration in the late 1990s, a meeting 
was arranged with Garth Brooks. 

HOWARD, who was serving as the 
then-subcommittee chairman, was a 
lifelong fan of bluegrass and traditional 
country music. He didn’t really 
know who Brooks was and was far more 
interested in arranging a meeting with 
Grandpa Jones from the Grand Ole 

Opry, but he knows who he is now. In 
fact, Garth is making a comeback; and, 
HOWARD, you will enjoy many, many 
more opportunities to enjoy the music 
that you love. 

He would always ask me how things 
were in the Star City, which is my 
hometown of Roanoke, Virginia, and 
took an interest in me and what I was 
doing. 

On the committee, as the chairman 
of the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual 
Property, and the Internet, 
where he serves now and has served on 
a number of occasions in the past, he 
stood very strong for the rights, the 
private property rights of people who 
are creators of music and motion pictures 
and great products that they 
seek patents on and so on. 

His work will serve for a long time in 
the future to protect that great American 
incentive to create and create 
jobs. His work has created many jobs 
for many Americans. 

He is a true son of the Sixth District 
of North Carolina. I am from the Sixth 
District of Virginia, but in his case, he 
is a lifelong son of the Sixth District, 
having been born in Greensboro, educated 
in the Sixth District, and been a 
county attorney and an assistant U.S. 
attorney. He has been a revenuer with 
the North Carolina Department of Revenue. 


What I didn’t know was that his first 
6 years in his professional life, he was 
a claims adjuster for the State Farm 
Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. 
So here, in the closing days of 
his service, I am still learning new 
things about my friend, HOWARD COBLE. 

HOWARD, thank you very much for 
not only being my friend and a great 
colleague to all of us here in the House, 
but for being a great American. Thank 
you, and God bless you. 

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
our colleague from North Carolina, 
PATRICK MCHENRY, the chief deputy 
whip. 

Mr. MCHENRY. I thank the secretary 
of the Republican Conference, my colleague 
and classmate from North Carolina, 
VIRGINIA FOXX. 

Mr. Speaker, today, I stand in tribute 
with the fine threads of a man named 
HOWARD COBLE. Congressman, State 
representative, Secretary of the North 
Carolina Department of Revenue, captain 
of the United States Coast Guard, 
school bus driver—that is where it all 
began, in high school. That was his 
first public service. 

JOHN HOWARD COBLE has held a variety 
of titles during his time and during 
his years, but to me, he has always 
been known as the dean, the dean of 
the North Carolina delegation, which 
he has been, for the last 15 years, the 
longest-serving Republican Member of 
this body in the history of the State of 
North Carolina, and my friend. 

I am here to pay tribute and to thank 
him for his time in public service. He is 
what a Member of Congress should be, 
and that is concerned for his constituents 
and being their voice here in 
Washington and having an impact. 

You certainly, my dean, have had a 
huge impact on my life, those that are 
paying tribute to say thank you tonight, 
but also your constituents and 
the American people, and we thank 
you. 

Now, there are a number of stories 
about the dean, a number of them I 
would like to tell over the years, and 
most of them are, in fact, true. 

This one story I want to tell tonight—
actually, two, if I may. It goes 
back to the first time HOWARD ran for 
Congress in 1984. The campaign committee 
for the Republicans brought up 
folks in tough, challenging races to 
have some video and film shot with 
President Ronald Reagan. He helped 
with his popularity to help get some 
folks across the finish line in 1984. 

HOWARD was so nervous that he forget 
to shake the Gipper’s hand, so one 
of the campaign committee staff, they 
were coming to Coble’s district, and 
HOWARD said, ‘‘Where were you?’’ And 
he said, ‘‘Well, I was just in Alabama 
with President Reagan.’’ 

‘‘Oh, really?’’ 

He says, ‘‘Yeah. I told him I was 
going to Greensboro, and President 
Reagan looked at me and said, ’Well, 
tell that son of a gun that didn’t shake 
my hand I said hello.’’’ 

So HOWARD got a little flustered and 
was a little embarrassed and everything 
else until everybody started 
laughing, but HOWARD has had a great 
sense of humor, and that shows the real 
testament to HOWARD’s integrity. 

The other thing about HOWARD is fiscal 
conservatism. It goes back to what 
he said in his first campaign, he is 
going to bring a sharp pencil to the 
Washington budget, and he, in fact, 
has. 

In fact, it wasn’t very well-appreciated 
during his early service in Congress. 
There was a Member of Congress 
who was furious, who said, ‘‘That sharp 
pencil might actually get your ticket 
written out of Congress.’’ And HOWARD 
told him that he thought, ‘‘Well, I believe 
there is life after Congress,’’ and 
let the guy go on his way. 

Well, that guy was not reelected, and 
HOWARD has been reelected 14 times 
during his time here, so true proof that 
fiscal conservatism can still win. 

There are a number of other stories 
that we will talk about over perhaps a 
drink afterwards, but the one thing is 
everybody from his district knows and 
those of us from North Carolina know 
that he knows every high school mascot 
in the State of North Carolina. 

Every child that I see that comes 
through Congress is simply amazed 
that their dean knows where they are 
from and knows their high school and 
their high school mascot. 

b 2000 
It is because he cares. So we are 
grateful tonight, and we want to say 
‘‘thank you’’ to our friend, our dean, 
our leader—JOHN HOWARD COBLE. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 
to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. 
KAPTUR). 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7923 

Ms. KAPTUR. I want to thank the 
secretary of the Republican caucus for 
granting me the time tonight and to 
say that I rise as a Member from the 
loyal opposition, who has great affection, 
friendship, and admiration for my 
neighbor in the Rayburn Building. 

Mr. Speaker, I would say that Congressman 
HOWARD COBLE represents the 
values of gentlemanly behavior, affability, 
cordiality, some might say— 
those of us from the North would call 
it—a bit of a courtly manner, which I 
always associated with the South. He 
is not just a man of character, but he 
is a character, and his personality and 
demeanor represent the type of 
collegiality that is so important to 
bring this institution together. I have 
no doubt he has well represented the 
constituents of his North Carolina district 
these many years—the Sixth District—
and they probably share my 
great affection for this wonderful man. 

Now, I say that knowing that we disagree, 
issue-wise, on almost everything; 
but I think HOWARD COBLE is the 
kind of person who represents what 
Congress should be—individuals who 
may disagree on issues but who become 
friends through their years of service. 
That is really remarkable because 
many people who go to work every day 
in this country go to work with people 
who think just like they do. They are 
in the same business or they teach a 
course in something or they are surrounded 
by those who agree, but what 
makes HOWARD COBLE special is he can 
be friends with people who disagree. 
Now, those who disagree with him even 
might come from his own party. One 
comes to mind in particular, someone 
he has kindly called the ‘‘lady of the 
harbor.’’ I don’t know if former Congresswoman 
Helen Bentley is listening 
tonight or not, but she has a few remembrances 
of HOWARD as well. 

Though we might have disagreed, we 
became great friends, and it makes the 
service bearable. It makes it bearable. 
HOWARD is also my neighbor over in the 
Rayburn Building, and there isn’t a 
time that we pass in the hall that he 
always doesn’t say, ‘‘Hey, good morning.’’ 
‘‘Hey, good afternoon. How are 
you doing?’’ His compassionate nature 
and his Mr. Cordiality, really, are extraordinary 
qualities in an institution 
where people come with very, very 
strongly held views. So I want to pay 
tribute to HOWARD COBLE’s service. I 
didn’t know he was the longest-serving 
Republican in North Carolina history. 
He has served honorably, and he has 
helped this institution to hold together. 


Thank you, HOWARD COBLE, for 
teaching all of us how to behave and 
how to be effective in our service. May 
God bless you in the days and years 
ahead. You know you always have family 
here. We appreciate your service, 
and we thank the people of North Carolina 
for sending you here these many 
years. Godspeed. 

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 
to our distinguished colleague from 
Texas, Mr. LAMAR SMITH. 

Mr. SMITH of Texas. I thank the gentlewoman 
for yielding. 

Mr. Speaker, let me say that I am absolutely 
privileged and honored to be 
here tonight to be able to talk about 
such a good friend, HOWARD COBLE. 

If I were to describe HOWARD in two 
words—and this is an ultimate compliment 
in my book—it would be that 
he is a gentleman and a scholar, and 
there aren’t too many people who actually 
succeed in achieving both those 
kinds of distinctions. 

So, HOWARD, it is nice to be with you 
tonight. You are here in the front row 
of the House Chamber, and we celebrate 
your contributions to public 
service, and we honor you for being the 
great person that you are. 

I have often said—and I have mentioned 
this to HOWARD COBLE in per-
son—that if there were such a thing as 
a congressional class president, it 
would be HOWARD COBLE. Now, we don’t 
have such a thing as a class president, 
but if we did, I think HOWARD would be 
nominated and voted upon and approved 
by acclamation. He is that popular 
here. He is that dearly loved and 
respected by all of us. 

I have had the privilege of sitting 
next to him on the Judiciary Committee 
for many, many years, and during 
that time, I have watched HOWARD 
work; I have watched him speak; and I 
have watched him think. He has been 
the chairman of three subcommittees 
on the Judiciary Committee—first, 
Crime; second, Administrative Law; 
and, third, Intellectual Property—that 
being the most recent subcommittee 
that he has chaired. He also chaired another 
subcommittee, early on, on the 
Transportation Committee, which 
means that he is probably one of those 
rare Members of Congress—perhaps 
even the only one—who has chaired 
four subcommittees in the House of 
Representatives. 

Throughout all of that time and in 
all of my years of being with HOWARD, 
he has exhibited some wonderful attributes, 
and those qualities are graciousness, 
smarts, and politeness— 
again, a rare combination in any individual, 
but those are the qualities— 
those are the attributes—that we see in 
HOWARD on a daily basis. 

HOWARD COBLE and I share something 
else in common, and that is that we 
often are half of a congressional doubles 
team that has been playing tennis 
for years and years and years. 

HOWARD, I would like to say that we 
are the better half, and maybe that is 
true half the time—I am not sure—or 
something close to that. There have 
been a number of Members who have 
participated in these doubles matches, 
and two primary Members who are oftentimes 
on the other side of the net 
from HOWARD and me are BOB GOODLATTE 
and FRED UPTON. They have 
been joined on occasion by SHELLEY 
MOORE CAPITO and also by KEVIN 
YODER. 

I have to say, HOWARD, I do believe 
that whoever plays with SHELLEY 

MOORE CAPITO probably wins more 
often than not, or maybe I should say 
that when Shelley was playing with, 
say, Bob or Fred that we had our hands 
full. That is not to say we were always 
on the losing side. We held our own. It 
has just been a real pleasure to enjoy 
those times together with you, and I 
will say, unequivocally, that I don’t 
know of anybody else who is a better 
volleyer than you. If anyone got a tennis 
ball past you in the last 10 years, I 
did not see it, so we appreciate your 
tennis prowess as well. 

Lastly, again, we are here tonight 
just to honor a great man—a gentleman 
and a scholar—both for his public 
service, for being an example to all 
of us in the House, and also, to so many 
of us, for being just an exceptionally 
good friend. 

HOWARD, thank you for being with us 
for these wonderful years that you 
have been in Congress. You have done 
so much for your constituents and have 
done so much for us as well—your colleagues 
and friends in the House. It is 
a privilege to be here tonight. 

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 
to the gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE. 

Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the manager 
of this Special Order, and it gives 
me great privilege to be able to stand 
here today. 

Mr. Speaker, as I look at Congressman 
COBLE, I think of the men and 
women who love this institution. I love 
it, and I have had the privilege of serving 
on the House Judiciary Committee, 
which I believe is the holder of the 
Founding Fathers’ dream of democracy 
for this country. As I have worked with 
Congressman COBLE, I have seen nothing 
but his love for the law, for the 
broad depth of the House Judiciary 
Committee and, might I say, the 
power. 

Congressman, you have used that 
power with gentlemanly gentleness and 
forcefulness in representing your constituents 
and your philosophy. 

We have had some tough battles on 
the House Judiciary Committee, but I 
have always seen and known HOWARD 
COBLE to be a gentleman. 

I am reminded of how many days and 
moments and minutes and months that 
we have been here in this place, and, 
HOWARD, I believe that, every time we 
have seen each other, we have said 
‘‘hello’’ with a smile. I thank you for 
that, and it represents your love of this 
country and your love of the system of 
justice and democracy and the respect 
for difference of opinion. 

Let me also say that I have a great 
Texan as my daughter. She loves 
Texas, and she is now an elected official, 
but she went on to the University 
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and 
Duke. She couldn’t leave North Carolina. 
She knew the bipartisan manner 
of your work, and as they studied on 
those two campuses, they knew Congressman 
HOWARD COBLE. 

So let me say to you, on behalf of 
those of us who have worked with you 


H7924 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE November 12, 2014 

over the years—Democrats and Republicans—
and in the time that I have had 
the privilege of serving in this House, 
what a mighty ‘‘thank you’’ we want to 
give you and to recognize the service 
you have given to the Nation, to your 
constituents and, certainly, the teaching 
that you have given to all of us. 
Well done, my good friend. We will 
miss you, and we wish for you a long 
life and an enjoyable time in continuing 
to serve in your own way the 
United States of America. Thank you 
so very much. We love you, HOWARD. 

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 
to our distinguished colleague from 
North Carolina (Mr. HOLDING). 

Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak for a few minutes about some of 
the many remarkable qualities that 
my friend—the leader of the North 
Carolina delegation, Congressman 
HOWARD COBLE—has exemplified 
throughout his nearly 30 years of service 
to the Sixth District of North Carolina 
and its people. 

To earn the continuous confidence of 
your constituents for three decades, 
Mr. Speaker, is a tremendous honor, 
and it is one that HOWARD COBLE has 
unfailingly performed with remarkable 
humility, never taking it for granted 
that he would be reelected. 

To also earn the respect and devotion 
of your staff, Members of this House on 
both sides of the aisle—certainly as we 
have seen tonight—and of the many 
stakeholders whom he has worked with 
on a daily basis throughout his career 
as a legislator is a testament to HOWARD’s 
commitment to public service, 
and more importantly, Mr. Speaker, it 
is a testament to his personal character 
and charm. 

Many of the laws HOWARD COBLE has 
authored have been in politically and 
technically complex areas—copyright, 
patent and trademark. These agreements 
can be very difficult to negotiate 
when it is vitally important to 
the public and the American economy 
that we get it right. HOWARD COBLE has 
gotten it right. He has protected the 
rights of individual authors and inventors 
just as the drafters of the Constitution 
intended them to be. HOWARD’s 
skills and his unblemished reputation 
for fair dealing among all parties 
have been critical to the congressional 
efforts over the many years to 
forge consensus in these difficult areas. 

HOWARD’s commitment to public 
service, as we have heard tonight from 
the other speakers, began long before 
1984 when he was elected to Congress. 
It is a commitment to public service 
that spans over 50 years. Throughout 
his life, he has performed these duties 
with a sense of grace, compassion, and 
respect—respect for people, respect for 
his colleagues, respect for the process, 
respect for the institutions of government—
as have all been echoed here tonight. 


I have talked to a number of Congressman 
COBLE’s staff to hear reflections 
that they have had, and a number 
of them have recalled some poignant 
moments: 

One recalled the valuable lessons 
that HOWARD has taught him. One of 
the longest-serving staff members told 
me how impressed he was to learn why 
HOWARD went back to his district regularly 
to meet with constituents—constituents 
who were unlikely to support 
him. He didn’t only meet with his supporters 
but with the folks who didn’t 
support him. HOWARD explained that 
the congressional seat he was in didn’t 
belong to him but that it was their 
seat and that all of his constituents 
needed to know that they have a Congressman 
who cares about them, who 
thinks about them, and who represents 
them in Washington—even if they decide 
never to vote for him that he will 
represent them; 

Another staff member echoed the 
sentiment, recalling how refreshing it 
was to work for a Member who was always 
able to stay true to his ideas, describing 
HOWARD as someone who appreciates 
real people; 

Another staff member remarked that 
she was so impressed at how other 
Members responded to him. She recalled 
that at the beginning of a Judiciary 
Committee markup right before 
HOWARD’s father passed away that 
Chairman Hyde started off with a moment 
of silence and that, after that 
moment of silence, the first two Members 
to come up to HOWARD and express 
sorrow for his loss were Representative 
Watt and Representative Delahunt— 
two colleagues who crossed the aisle to 
console and share a moment with their 
friend who was mourning a loss. 

b 2015 
Witnessing that moment made this 
young staffer proud to work for HOWARD. 
It taught her a lot about the importance 
of treating people in a humane 
fashion. And, indeed, HOWARD 
treats everyone humanely, whether it 
is in a meeting with constituents, a 
meeting with high-level officials, a 
meeting with celebrities, or meeting 
with staff members after a long day, 
having them come over to his office 
where they share a laugh for a few moments, 
calling staff members after a 
long markup and telling them that he 
really appreciated the work they did 
today. 
In an interview, Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks 
ago, HOWARD stated: ‘‘I’ve been richly 
blessed with good friends up here and 
also back home. And I will continue to 
embrace those friends, even though I’m 
leaving.’’ 
Well, Mr. Speaker, it is us who have 
been richly blessed by HOWARD. And we 
will continue to embrace our good 
friend HOWARD because he is a friend 
and a mentor to us all forever. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
give our colleague from North Carolina 
a moment to respond if he wishes to 
make any comments about the comments 
that we have made about him. I 
am not sure that I want to just yield 
him such time as he may consume, but 
my hope is that if he wishes to respond, 
he will take the opportunity to do so. 

Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, as many of 
my colleagues know, my middle name 
is Brevity. If it can be said in 5 minutes, 
don’t take 25 minutes to say it. 

You all surely do know how to make 
an old man feel good, and I thank you 
for this. You have embellished many 
areas of my life which I have embraced 
as well. 

But I must correct what PATRICK 
MCHENRY said. I do not know every 
mascot in North Carolina. I think Virginia 
has given me credit for that too. 

Thanks to all of you who have taken 
part in this Special Order. You have 
made me feel very special, and for that, 
I thank you. 

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank all of my colleagues who have 
come down tonight. I did not thank 
them on an individual basis because I 
wanted to save as much time as possible 
for people to make the comments 
that they have made. 

I think the fact that we have had 
such a bipartisan presentation here tonight 
supports the comments that have 
been made tonight. The comments that 
have been made, notwithstanding what 
our colleague said, have been extremely 
eloquent, and I want to thank 
everybody for coming down. 

I want you to know that we did our 
best to have this event earlier this 
year, but we could not get on Mr. 
COBLE’s schedule because there were so 
many parties going on on his behalf 
that we had an awful time finding a 
night to do it. 

I don’t know anybody who has more 
people paying him tribute than our 
friend HOWARD Coble. We are going to 
miss him tremendously and his North 
Carolina values of hard work, common 
sense, and sacrifice on behalf of those 
he has served. 

It has been a personal joy for me to 
work alongside HOWARD Coble in the 
Congress for the last 10 years, and it 
really is hard to imagine how we will 
go on without him. 

His friendship and leadership on our 
State delegation will be dearly missed 
in the coming years. But his legacy of 
service and devotion to our home State 
and all North Carolinians will continue 
to be a standard for current and future 
leaders to follow. He will always be our 
dean. He will always be our ‘‘leadah.’’ 

And, Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 

f 

OBAMACARE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COLLINS 
of Georgia). Under the Speaker’s 
announced policy of January 3, 2013, 
the Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I just 
wanted to also express my love and appreciation 
for HOWARD COBLE. There is 
not a more honorable, noble, humble, 
able man in all of Congress, and it has 
been a great opportunity and a great 
blessing to me in my life to be a friend 
of HOWARD COBLE and to pray with 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7925 

him, to worship with him, to study 
with him, to discuss with him. And I 
will always be grateful to the most eligible 
bachelor in all of Congress. I 
don’t know who will fill that role when 
HOWARD COBLE is gone. 

But thank you. You will be missed. 

Mr. COBLE. On that note, Mr. Speaker, 
I am going to depart. Thank you, 
LOUIE. 

Mr. GOHMERT. It is amazing, a man 
who has given so much of his life, as 
HOWARD COBLE has, to this institution, 
to working to make the country better, 
safer, efforts to make it more free, to 
help free up the economy so that it can 
achieve the high plateaus that it could 
reach if the government would release 
the boot from off the neck of the economy. 


Whether you agreed with HOWARD 
COBLE or not, his honesty stands in 
stark contrast to what we have learned 
about recently with respect to the man 
Jonathan Gruber, who was not elected 
but was selected by the United States 
President. President Obama had gotten 
him basically to be what they call the 
architect of the ObamaCare bill. 

The name on the bill was the Affordable 
Care Act. Actually, the real name 
of the bill involved being a one-time 
tax deduction for first-time home buyers 
who were veterans and for other 
purposes. But the Senate took that 
bill, they stripped out every single 
word of the bill that would have helped 
veterans, and, instead, after deleting 
every word of the bill to help veterans, 
substituted therein about 2,500 pages of 
something that people now call 
ObamaCare. 

And we find out, most of us having 
seen the video of the ObamaCare architect, 
Jonathan Gruber, saying: 

This bill was written in a tortured way to 
make sure CBO did not score the mandate as 
taxes. If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, 
the bill dies. Okay, so it’s written to do that. 
In terms of risk-rated subsidies, if you had a 
law which said that healthy people are going 
to pay in, you made explicit healthy people 
pay in and sick people get money, it would 
not have passed. Lack of transparency is a 
huge political advantage. And basically, call 
it the stupidity of the American voter or 
whatever, but basically, that was really, 
really critical for the thing to pass. Look, I 
wish Mark was right, that we could make it 
all transparent, but I’d rather have this law 
than not. 

Staggering. The man who designed 
ObamaCare admitting that if the 
American public, or even the Democrats 
in Congress, had known what was 
in ObamaCare, the Democrats alone 
would never have passed it. 

It was not transparent, as the President 
had promised. It was a travesty 
forced upon the American people without 
a single Republican vote, not one 
single Republican vote. 

And I still hear people say, Well, you 
know, nobody read it. I read it. And I 
knew how bad it was going to be. It 
should never have passed. And if the 
Obama administration and our Democrat 
friends have been honest, then it 
would not have passed. 

I will now yield to a very dear friend 
from Texas, LAMAR SMITH. I think the 
world of his opinion. 

Mr. SMITH of Texas. If the gentleman 
will yield briefly, I will just say 
that I purposely stayed on the House 
floor just because I respect and admire 
the gentleman and what he has to say. 
And I happen to have agreed with everything 
he mentioned tonight about 
ObamaCare. 

And let me say also that the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) oftentimes 
speaks on the House floor. 
And he is speaking to an audience that 
is listening to us on C–SPAN. And we 
do appreciate his speaking the truth. 
We appreciate his bringing out the 
facts, and we hope that those who are 
in a position to make changes or to 
even repeal ObamaCare will do so. And 
if that occurs, it will be in large part a 
tribute to LOUIE GOHMERT’s persistence 
in pointing out the flaws in 
ObamaCare. 

I thank the gentleman for yielding. 

Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my friend 
from San Antonio. 

You know, it is ironic. There are so 
many people here. And a lot of new 
people have gotten elected. Three were 
sworn in here tonight. And the ones I 
have come to know, they appreciate 
honesty. 

And I know I was in the national 
media not long ago with Dennis Kucinich, 
and people were surprised. Well, 
even though you and Dennis Kucinich 
disagreed, you seemed very friendly, 
like you were friends. Dennis Kucinich 
and I are friends. And the big reason 
is—even though I think he is wrong on 
a lot of issues—the man has never lied 
to me. He has always been honest. 

Honesty in this body is such an important 
commodity. And certainly 
HOWARD COBLE is one of the most honorable, 
honest men that have ever 
served. And that stands just in such 
stark contrast with the statements 
that have been discovered by the 

ObamaCare architect, Jonathan 
Gruber. 
There is another story from 

foxnews.com. And they found this. Of 
course he had been commenting, Oh, 
well, that was just off the cuff and, you 
know, just kind of kidding around. 

And then another videotape was 
found of him talking: 

Referring to the so-called ‘‘Cadillac tax’’ 
on high-end health plans, he said: ‘‘They proposed 
it, and that passed because the American 
people are too stupid to understand the 

difference.’’ 

The article says: 
He suggested that taxing individuals would 

have been politically unpalatable, but taxing 
the companies worked because Americans 
didn’t understand the difference. 

Gruber said the ‘‘lack of transparency’’ in 
the way the law was crafted was critical. 
‘‘Basically, call it the stupidity of the American 
voter or whatever, but basically that 
was really, really critical for the thing to 
pass.’’ 

Then Gruber went on MSNBC to express 
regret: 

On Tuesday, he said, ‘‘I was speaking off 
the cuff, and I basically spoke inappropri


ately, and I regret having made those comments.’’ 


Well, it is interesting. He never says 
that he regrets having those opinions. 

After that video, a second video came 
to light, where the designer, the architect 
of ObamaCare, called the American 
people stupid, too stupid to realize 
how bad ObamaCare was. His apology 
is not that he is sorry that he thought 
the American people were stupid or 
that he didn’t really think they were 
stupid or that he is sorry there wasn’t 
more transparency or that he is sorry 
that the Democrats in Congress were 
the only ones that voted for the bill in 
the House or Senate or that the American 
people were snookered. He makes 
no apologies for deceiving the American 
people, deceiving the Democrats 
in the House and the Senate into voting 
for a bill through their dishonest 
shenanigans. No regrets for that. He 
only regrets that he said these things 
so they were caught on video. 

b 2030 
If the man were cut out of the same 
cloth as a HOWARD COBLE, a man of 
honest candor, then he would come before 
the American people, and he would 
say, yes, I was the architect of this 
bill, ObamaCare. It wasn’t right to 
trick the American people and to trick 
the Democrats into voting for a bill 
they hadn’t read when some of us knew 
how bad it was going to be. That was 
wrong, and I apologize for tricking the 
American people, for lying to the 
American people, and for not having 
transparency. 
I think real nobility would require 
someone who helped with ObamaCare— 
even the President—to say, do you 
know what? Back in 2008, when I was 
Senator Obama, I was running for 
President, and I promised the American 
people, if you give me the Presidency, 
we will have a debate on C– 
SPAN. We will do it all transparently. 
We will have it out there for everyone 
to see and everyone to hear who is taking 
what sides, because that is the way 
the health care debate should be, completely 
transparent. 
After he became President, he puts 
Jonathan Gruber in charge, and we get 
a bill that Gruber has admitted tricked 
the American people and was nontransparent. 
I just want to mention back again 
what he brought up, the Cadillac tax, 
when he said that the American people 
are too stupid to understand the difference. 
Actually, that Cadillac tax, it 
is not really going to be a Cadillac tax, 
but in the original bill, they were clever 
enough to put that 40 percent tax 
into place after the 2016 election, so 
that Democrats can run for President 
in 2016 and say, no, no, it is all right, it 
is going to be okay, when they know 
good and well that under the massive 
40 percent tax—as if the middle class 
and the poor haven’t been slammed 
enough with this terrible economy, 
with the lower wages, and with the 
part-time work, if they are fortunate 


H7926 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE November 12, 2014 

enough to find an employer who gets 
them any kind of decent health care 
plan, any amount the health care plan 
costs over $10,200—even if they pay for 
it—it is going to be 40 percent tax on 
all above $10,200 for an individual 
health insurance policy. 

So if say, for example, the policy 
costs $15,200, $5,000 over the amount for 
an individual policy, then that poor, 
middle class, hardworking union member—
because the union members will 
have policies that are worth more than 
$10,200—so that poor union member 
that is just already soaked to the gills 
with taxes, charges, and fees will pay 
another 40 percent tax on the $5,000 
extra that is spent by his employer for 
that policy. 

In other words, a guy that is just getting 
a barely decent health insurance 
policy is going to add another $2,000 
that that middle class individual is 
going to have to pay to have insurance 
that may give him a massive, several 
thousand, 5,000 deductible. 

I have heard from so many people. 
Only a few that we have heard from are 
paying less. Most everybody my office 
has heard from is paying massive 
amounts more for their health insurance, 
and some report our deductible 
went from $500 that we could barely afford 
to cover, that $500 deductible went 
up to 5,000, and our premiums went up. 

What is affordable about ObamaCare? 
We can’t afford it. We can’t afford to 
pay $5,000 in health care before the insurance 
even kicks in, and then we still 
have a copay and all kinds of other requirements. 


I heard one female couple that was in 
their sixties saying, gee, the last thing 
they ought to have to pay for is maternity 
care. Well, they are right, but 
under ObamaCare, it doesn’t matter if 
you are 80 years old, you are still going 
to pay for maternity care if you buy insurance. 


So the best we could do is return individual 
Americans control of their 
own health care back into their hands, 
and there are many of us, Republicans, 
that have had proposals for health care 
bills. I had a bill, and I could never get 
CBO to score it, and to just remind, 
Mr. Speaker, our Members that may be 
listening, it was CBO, the Congressional 
Budget Office, that does official 
scoring. 

And they actually scored ObamaCare 
as costing over $1 trillion—$1.1 trillion, 
I believe—and the President was upset 
because he promised the American people 
it would actually be lower than $1 
trillion. So the head of the Congressional 
Budget Office, Mr. Doug Elmendorf, 
got called over to the Oval Office, 
and magically, after a meeting with 
the President, they came back and 
redid their numbers and said it was actually 
only $800 billion. The President 
said, whoopee, see, I told you it was 
going to be less than 1 trillion. 

Then after it passed, CBO came back 
and said, do you know what? Actually, 
it is going to be over 1 trillion, and 
then later came back and said, oh, it 

may be more like 1.7 or 1.8 trillion. And 
then we have other entities saying, no, 
it looks like it could be even $4 trillion 
it is going to cost. 

As I said before and will continue to 
say, if the scoring entity’s margin of 
error is plus or minus 400 percent, it is 
time for a new scoring entity, and I 
think we could do that. 

I talked with Arthur Laffer about it 
a number of times, Reagan’s chief architect 
of his economic proposals, and 
unlike Mr. Gruber, Arthur Laffer is a 
very honorable, honest—great sense of 
humor—but a brilliant man. 

Despite his Ivy League education and 
his background, he is a brilliant guy. 
There are proposals that we have that 
would not even cost $1 trillion that 
would return the control back to the 
patient. 

But Mr. Gruber has finally been 
caught, he said it over a year ago, but 
he has finally been caught admitting 
that the only way they got ObamaCare 
passed was the American people were 
too stupid. 

What he was talking about on the 
Cadillac tax is he was saying that if we 
let the American people know that 
they were ultimately going to pay that 
40 percent tax on everything over 
$10,200 for an individual policy, they 
would never have gone along with it. 

But instead of saying that the individual 
is going to pay for it, we said, 
oh, the corporation is going to pay for 
it, and therefore, it won’t cost the individual 
anything. 

Well, that is about as dishonest and 
insane as people in the administration 
telling our senior citizens, oh, don’t 
worry about the fact that ObamaCare 
cut Medicare by $716 billion. Don’t 
worry about that because that only 
goes to the doctors, the hospitals, and 
the people that provide the knees and 
the things like that, but it won’t affect 
you at all. 

Well, I think we saw, in this election, 
the seniors are a lot smarter than Mr. 
Gruber gave them credit for. Yes, many 
of them were fooled when they were 
lied to by the administration, but now, 
they figured out, wait a minute, you 
said that $716 billion in cuts to Medicare 
that ObamaCare did wouldn’t affect 
me, and now, I can’t get my knee 
surgery, I can’t get my back surgery, I 
can’t get my pacemaker, I can’t get the 
things I need. 

Apparently, that was a lie as well. It 
did affect seniors. It is affecting seniors, 
and it will affect seniors until the 
day it is finally repealed. 

I know there are people out there, 
Mr. Speaker, that have said, well, there 
were a couple things that were good. 
We ought to just leave the good things 
in it. 

Generally, they point to two things, 
number one, a young person who is living 
at home and is under 26 years of 
age can share their family insurance 
with their parents, and that neglects to 
recognize the fact that when the Democrats 
controlled the House, they controlled 
the Senate, and they controlled 

the White House with President 
Obama, we offered repeatedly, look, 
guys, let us have a little say in this 
bill. In fact, why don’t we just pass a 
freestanding bill? 

And I know the Democrats said they 
wanted to cut off at 26 years of age, but 
there were a lot of us that said, look, if 
the economy is bad and a young person 
is living at home, they are 26, 27, I 
don’t really care, if you are living at 
home with your parents and they have 
got health insurance, and you are willing 
to pay the little extra the insurance 
company charges to add another 
family member, then let them be on 
their family’s insurance. 

We were okay with passing that. Republicans 
were. We welcomed that. We 
were never, ever given the chance. We 
were told, we have the votes to pass it, 
we don’t need your help, we don’t need 
your input. 

As a former chief justice, judge, and 
civil trial attorney in prior lives, I 
have seen a lot of insurance litigation, 
and I have seen cases where insurance 
companies acted very unfairly in canceling 
people’s policies when it was 
wrong and it was unfair because they 
said, oh, well, you had a preexisting 
condition they already knew about. 

Republicans offered to work with our 
Democratic friends that were in the 
majority to fashion a bill that would 
deal with the issue of unfairness and, 
at times, even fraud by an insurance 
company, dealing with insureds unfairly 
and using the gimmick of a preexisting 
condition claim to deny coverage. 
We were willing to work with 
them on a bill like that. 

Fortunately, most insurance companies 
don’t act like that; and, fortunately, 
in most situations, even those 
that do occasionally don’t all the time 
and, in fact, don’t most of the time. 

But we were okay with the bill that 
would address those issues, but it 
should have only applied to policies 
that went across State lines because, 
otherwise, it is a State issue. 

And I know in Texas we have a State 
insurance commissioner, commission, 
there are people that are watching over 
these issues, and it is a whole lot easier 
to file a complaint in your State capital, 
even if you are a State as big as 
Texas or Alaska, than it is to have to 
file a complaint and deal with the morass 
right here in Washington, D.C. 

Well, on the heels of all the admissions 
of lies that were told to pass 
ObamaCare that have now come out, 
an article Monday by Elise Viebeck, 
and the title is ‘‘HHS’’—that is Health 
and Human Services—‘‘lowers 
ObamaCare enrollment expectations.’’ 

It says: 

Officials at the Department of Health and 
Human Services on Monday projected that 
up to 9.9 million people would be enrolled in 
ObamaCare in 2015, millions fewer than Congressional 
Budget Office estimates. 

Federal health officials are projecting that 
ObamaCare enrollment will include at least 

3.1 million fewer people next year than Congressional 
Budget analysts thought. 
Well, there goes the Congressional 
Budget analysts once again being off in 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7927 

the nature of 30 percent. That is a plus-
or-minus margin of error of 30 percent. 
It is not really so good. 

We need another vehicle for competition 
for scoring that would be less expensive 
and would be more accurate, 
and then the only way you could really 
get it accurate is if you have competition, 
and then you begin to score the 
scorers, because what CBO did in 
ObamaCare and what they have done 
on these enrollment expectations, I 
mean they are just outrageous. 

Anyway, there are plenty of articles 
about the American people being too 
stupid according to the man who designed 
the ObamaCare bill. It is unfortunate 
that people in this administration 
thought that the American people 
were too stupid and too gullible. 

Unfortunately, since there are honest 
people in government, the people like 
Mr. Gruber that were so dishonest to 
pass a massive bill that took away patients’ 
health care rights and the 
things that would prolong their lives, 
the things that would make their lives 
more comfortable, it is just a tragedy, 
but there are honest people in government. 
Now, people will have to be even 
more cynical than they already were of 
government. 

This interesting survey was done by 
Kellyanne Conway, this article from 
November 7 of this year, the survey in 
the article points out that a majority 
of respondents, 76 percent, consider 
laws that require voters to present a 
photo ID before casting a ballot to be 
‘‘mostly fair,’’ and a total of 69 percent 
of Americans consider it ‘‘not a burden 
at all.’’ 

b 2045 
Amazing. 
Another point mentions, when asked, 
‘‘Do you agree or disagree that President 
Obama should, through executive 
action, allow illegal immigrants to remain 
in the United States?’’ 63 percent 
disagree. That is 53 percent strongly, 10 
percent somewhat. Only 30 percent 
agree. 
Another point of the survey, corruption 
in the Federal Government continues 
to be a serious concern among 
voters, with 92 percent now saying they 
consider it a serious problem. That is 
92 percent of Americans consider corruption 
a serious problem. 
Well, perhaps the fact that Mr. 
Gruber was getting paid and had a motivation, 
a pecuniary, a financial motivation 
for being out there selling 
ObamaCare as being such a great thing, 
and as he says now lying about it so 
much and obscuring the truth as much 
as he did, that kind of helps contribute 
to the 92 percent of Americans, or rather 
of voters, saying that they had serious 
concerns about corruption in Federal 
Government. 
The survey also indicated a full 80 
percent said that the Federal Government 
has become ‘‘less transparent’’ or 
‘‘stayed about the same’’ over the past 
6 years. 
When asked about ballot integrity 
and voter fraud, 74 percent consider it 
a problem. 

So much for those who say it isn’t a 
problem. It is a problem. 

I think because of photo IDs being 
used, for example in Texas this time, 
we had better election integrity. I 
know the Indiana law was upheld that 
required photo IDs, and Texas largely 
modeled their law after Indiana. It is a 
matter of protecting ballot integrity. 

I have been over to the Department 
of Justice, and I find it interesting that 
the Attorney General who is outgoing 
right now requires you cannot get in to 
see the Attorney General unless you 
can produce a photo ID. Apparently, 
the incoming or the nominated candidate 
for Attorney General thinks 
photo IDs for elections are a problem, 
and it will be interesting to see if she 
changes the policy if she gets confirmed. 
The Senate needs to make a 
thorough investigation. They need to 
take their time and do it right. But we 
will see if this stands as a policy that 
photo IDs should be required to see the 
AGs but not to vote. 

With that, I yield back the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION 

Vol. 160 WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2014 No. 137

PRAYER 

The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered 
the following prayer: 

Let us pray. 

Eternal God, our hope for the years 
to come, as we prepare to turn to a new 
chapter in U.S. Senate history, we 
pause to acknowledge that You are our 
light and salvation. Lord, You are the 
strength of our lives, enabling us to 
move confidently toward the future. 

Empower our lawmakers who are 
coming and going, sustaining them in 
all of their tomorrows. Bless also the 
many other laborers who will be leaving 
us, who faithfully served without 
fanfare. Lord, reward their fidelity 
with Heaven’s commendation. As our 
Senators seek to respond to the voices 
of the American people, may they 
make it their top priority to listen to 
Your whisper. May pleasing You be 
their greatest desire. Let Your Kingdom 
come and Your will be done on 
Earth as it is in Heaven. 

We pray in Your sovereign Name. 
Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader is recognized. 

Senate 

MARKETPLACE AND INTERNET 

TAX FAIRNESS ACT—MOTION TO 

PROCEED 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to 
proceed to Calendar No. 467, S. 2609, the 
Marketplace Fairness Act. 

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will report the motion. 

The legislative clerk read as follows: 

Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 467, S. 
2609, a bill to restore States’ sovereign rights 
to enforce State and local sales and use tax 
laws, and for other purposes. 

SCHEDULE 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, following 
my remarks and those of the Republican 
leader, the Senate will be in a period 
of morning business until 5:30 this 
evening. During that time, Senators 
will be permitted to speak for up to 10 
minutes each, with the time equally divided 
and controlled between the two 
leaders or their designees. 

At 5:30 p.m. the Senate will proceed 
to cloture votes on the nominations of 
Randolph Moss and Leigh Martin May; 
one is from the District of Columbia 
and the other is from the State of 
Georgia. 

WORKING TOGETHER 

Mr. President, I have always believed 
it wise to follow Will Rogers’ admonition: 
‘‘Don’t let yesterday use up too 
much of today.’’ 

We have a lot of work to do and no 
time to dwell on the past. With just a 
few weeks left in this Congress—the 
113th—there are a number of important 
legislative matters before this body 
that must be finished. 

I congratulate the Republican leader 
who will soon become the new majority 
leader. The senior Senator from Kentucky 
and I have known one another 
for a very long period of time. We have 
been whips together. He was minority 
leader. I was minority leader and majority 
leader. We have been back and 
forth, so we understand these jobs. I 
appreciate his devotion to the State of 
Kentucky, to our country, and to the 
Senate. He knows I hold him in the 

highest regard. I am ready to work 
with him in good faith to make this institution 
function again for the American 
people. 

I saw firsthand how a strategy of obstruction 
was debilitating to our system. 
I have no desire to engage in that 
manner. I have been, as I mentioned 
before, and I mention again, the minority 
leader. I have been able to strike 
compromises with my Republican colleagues, 
and I am ready to do it again. 

Regardless of how one may interpret 
last week’s election results, it is clear 
the American people want us to join 
together to get things done for the 
middle class and all Americans, and we 
should be able to do that. After all, 
helping working families is not a partisan 
issue. Just last week we saw four 
very red States—Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska, 
and South Dakota—vote to increase 
their minimum wages. Clearly, 
Republicans outside this building don’t 
object to giving American workers a 
livable wage. 

The minimum wage is just one example. 
There are other issues such as student 
debt relief for borrowers, pay equity 
for women, and a number of other 
issues that need to be addressed as 
well. There is absolutely no reason we 
can’t work together on these issues and 
all issues so Democrats and Republicans 
can lend Americans the helping 
hand they so desperately need. 

Although the desks in this great 
Chamber may move around and 
change, our duty to help working 
American families never will. Senate 
Democrats are ready to work in good 
faith with their Republican counter-
parts—whether it is today, tomorrow, 
January, no matter when it is—to help 
the middle class, and when we do that, 
we help all of our citizenry. 

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Republican leader is recognized. 

LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, last 
week the American people sent a

S5886 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE November 12, 2014 

strong message to Washington. They 
voted for a new direction. They called 
for a change in the way we do things in 
the Senate, and they sent a new team 
to Washington to carry their wishes 
forward, and we plan to do just that. 

But several items remain for the outgoing 
Congress to consider and that is 
our immediate focus. 

In the weeks that remain in this Congress, 
we should work to accomplish 
the essential task of funding the Congress 
and preventing retroactive tax 
increases. We must address the expiring 
authority passed earlier this session 
for the Department of Defense to 
train and equip a moderate, vetted Syrian 
opposition, and we must continue 
to support the efforts to address the 
Ebola crisis. 

All of this will require cooperation 
from both sides of the aisle, from both 
sides of the rotunda, and from both 
ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. The actions 
of the next few weeks can help 
set a positive tone for the work of the 
next Congress. It is a tone that will depend 
largely on the administration’s 
willingness to respect the message sent 
last Tuesday. 

That is one of the things we discussed 
at the White House on Friday. 
It was a productive meeting. There is a 
lot both parties can accomplish together 
over the next couple of years. I 
hope that happens. In fact, I am optimistic. 
But working together requires 
trust. 

I think President Obama has the 
duty to help build the trust we all need 
to move forward together—not to double 
down in the old ways of doing business. 
That is why I think moving forward 
with the unilateral action on immigration 
he has planned would be a 
big mistake, as was last night’s announcement 
to essentially give China a 
free pass on emissions while hurting 
middle-class families and struggling 
miners here in our country. 

Last Friday, the President said the 
American people would like to see 
more cooperation in Washington. He 
said he thinks all of us have a responsibility—
himself in particular—to try 
and make that happen. That is the 
kind of tone the American people are 
looking for. Now it is on folks in Washington 
to calibrate their actions accordingly. 
So let’s not do things to 
hurt the possibility of a cooperative 
partnership. Let’s step back and focus 
on what can be accomplished together. 
Let’s listen to the American people. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MURPHY). 
The assistant minority leader. 

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, what 
happened on November 4 was the beginning 
of an opportunity—an opportunity 
we have to work together to restore 
faith in our Democratic institutions, to 
restore strong growth to our economy, 
and to restore a sense of purpose and 
principle to U.S. foreign policy. 

Starting with the incoming majority 
leader, my good friend, the senior Senator 
from Kentucky, Republicans have 
been entrusted by our fellow citizens to 

lead this Chamber next year. We understand 
the American people sent a 
strong message on November 4 that 
they were enormously frustrated by 
what they saw as dysfunction and the 
state of affairs in Washington, DC. We 
understand why they are eager for new 
leadership and a new direction. My 
party, the Republican Party, approaches 
this opportunity with humility 
and, above all, a clear-eyed commitment 
to address the top priorities 
of the American people. Of course, 
those priorities start with jobs and the 
economy. 

I know the unemployment rate has 
continued to tick down little by little, 
but it is fairly misleading when we consider 
the fact that we are stuck with a 
36-year low in the labor participation 
rate—the percentage of people who are 
actually looking for work. Indeed, 
there are still more than 7 million people 
looking for full-time work and 
working currently in part-time jobs. 
We know many people have become so 
discouraged that they have simply 
given up and they have quit looking, 
and that is a tragedy. 

Then there is this problem: America’s 
median household income is no 
higher in 2013 than it was nearly a 
quarter of a century ago, in 1989. That 
has been a silent tragedy—one that has 
been sustained by the middle class in 
America, who have seen no growth in 
their median household income for 
about a quarter of a century. 

The median income was lower last 
year than it was the year President 
Reagan left the White House. That is 
simply astonishing. It has crushed the 
middle class. Addressing that should be 
one of our highest priorities in the new 
Congress starting in January. 

Since 2011, our colleagues in the 
House of Representatives have been 
passing legislation they feel would 
boost job creation and increase wages. 
In the 113th Congress alone, they 
passed dozens of jobs bills. Unfortunately, 
as we know, those have not 
been taken up by the majority leader 
in the Senate, and they have been effectively 
declared dead on arrival. 

Then we also know this strategy of 
blocking amendments on pending legislation 
to prevent vulnerable incumbents 
from being forced to cast tough 
votes has backfired, because many of 
our colleagues in the majority have not 
been able to point to a legislative 
record of effectiveness for their own 
constituents because of this flawed 
strategy of blocking the Senate from 
considering amendments and voting on 
them. It is one thing to be in the minority 
and have the amendments or 
suggestions I am offering added, but it 
is harder to explain to your own constituents 
if you are in the majority and 
you are being blocked out too. So I 
hope we are done with that. 

I know the incoming majority leader, 
Senator MCCONNELL, believes strongly 
in returning the Senate to its traditions 
as the world’s greatest deliberative 
body, where anyone, regardless of 

who they are or which political party 
they are affiliated with, can come to 
the Senate floor and offer constructive 
suggestions and get a vote. That is 
what we do—at least that is what we 
used to do, and that is what we can do 
again, and that doesn’t mean just the 
majority party gets votes on their 
amendments; that means the minority 
party will get votes on their amendments. 
Hopefully, slowly but surely, we 
can begin to rebuild not only trust and 
confidence within ourselves and this 
institution, but regain the lost trust of 
the American people by showing that 
we can effectively solve problems on a 
bipartisan basis to the challenges they 
face as members of the hard-working 
middle class. 

Then there is the basic job of governing. 
We will pass a budget next 
year—something our friends across the 
aisle have failed to do since 2009. Now, 
here is something I do not think anybody 
will excuse or defend: How in the 
world can it be that when every small 
and large business in America has to 
have a budget, when families have to 
have a budget so they can determine 
their priorities and how they can most 
effectively utilize their income, that 
they have to pass a budget but the U.S. 
Congress does not? That is, frankly, 
malpractice, in my view, and it has to 
end, and it will end next year. 

I know Republicans and Democrats 
will continue to have policy disagreements. 
Nobody is suggesting that is not 
going to happen. But this is the place 
where those get debated, where they 
get voted on, and where majorities will 
actually pass legislation and send it to 
President Obama. And those will be 
largely, if not almost entirely bipartisan 
majorities, of course, by definition. 


We know Democrats by and large 
continue to support the Affordable 
Care Act and Republicans continue to 
believe it was a mistake and should be 
replaced with patient-centered alternatives. 
But we do not have to choose 
between complete paralysis and actually 
functioning. Dysfunction is not 
the only choice we have, and now that 
that has been rejected by the voters resoundingly, 
we know a change is in 
order. The American people have demanded 
it, they deserve it, and they 
will get it. 

So last week’s election will not 
change some of the fundamental policy 
differences we have between political 
parties on ObamaCare, on what we 
need to do to preserve and protect Social 
Security and Medicare and the 
like, and it will not change people’s 
points of view on other hot-button 
issues, but it will give us a chance to 
make some steady incremental 
progress on issues where we do agree. 

When I came to the Senate, Teddy 
Kennedy, the liberal lion from Massachusetts, 
had been here about 40 years, 
and he was working on the Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee 
with MIKE ENZI, a conservative 
Republican from Wyoming. 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5887 

One day I went up to MIKE ENZI and 
I said: Well, how is it that you and Senator 
Kennedy, with such diametrically 
opposing views on what the Congress 
ought to do and how to solve these 
problems, can actually work productively 
together? 

Senator ENZI said: That is easy. It is 
the 80–20 rule. The 80 percent we can 
agree on, we do. The 20 percent we cannot, 
we don’t; we put off for another 
day. 

That strikes me as eminently practical 
and a way for us to begin to get 
back to work again. 

When I talk about the easy stuff we 
can do, I am referring to the bipartisan 
majority that supports things such as 
the Keystone XL Pipeline authorization, 
increasing our natural gas exports 
not only for the job creation and 
economic boost it gives us here in 
America but also because it changes 
the geopolitics of the world, where people 
such as Vladimir Putin cannot put 
a bootheel on the gas supply to Europe 
or Ukraine and use that for their own 
purposes. 

I am confident we can find commonsense 
safeguards from an overreaching 
Federal bureaucracy. We can agree on 
things such as improving workforce 
training programs and do things that 
make it much easier to launch new infrastructure 
and construction projects. 
We can do things we should have done 
last year or this year, such as reforming 
our broken patent system to discourage 
abusive and costly litigation. 
We actually had a bipartisan bill in the 
Judiciary Committee, but it did not 
come to the floor because the majority 
leader would not bring it up because 
one of his constituencies simply objected 
to it. Well, no one should have a 
trump card when it comes to good, bipartisan 
legislation, and they will not 
next year. We will vote on patent reform. 


Then there are things such as mitigating 
some of the burdens of 
ObamaCare, restoring the 40-hour 
workweek, and repealing the medical 
device tax, and there is strong bipartisan 
support for repealing that tax 
which has driven medical device manufacturers 
and their jobs overseas. I 
have constituents, for example, in Dallas 
in that business, and they say they 
are building their business in Costa 
Rica because of the impact of this medical 
device tax and its negative impact 
on medical innovation and job creation 
here. 

I do know there is bipartisan support 
for abolishing the Independent Payment 
Advisory Board under Medicare. 
This is 15 bureaucrats who basically 
get to decide who gets medical care 
and who does not, with no real appeal 
or recourse. In the Judiciary Committee, 
on which I serve, we have had 
very impressive bipartisan support for 
things such as prison reform and even 
sentencing reform. 

Those are important issues of substance 
the Senate ought to be discussing, 
debating, voting on, and try


ing to find ways we can work together 
to achieve solutions. Each of the things 
I have mentioned has bipartisan support. 
If we can pass these measures 
with strong support on both sides of 
the aisle and send them to the President 
for his signature, it will be much 
easier to establish the trust and cooperation 
necessary to do the harder 
stuff. So starting with the easy stuff 
we have already identified that has bipartisan 
support—demonstrating we 
can actually do that—then I think we 
will have confidence in ourselves, and 
the American people will have confidence 
in us and their government to 
begin to tackle some of the more challenging 
issues. 

Senator MCCONNELL, the Republican 
leader, mentioned this, but it bears repeating: 
that the President is still 
threatening to go around Congress and 
use an Executive order to implement a 
new, radical change in our Federal 
Government’s immigration policy, and 
I think it is a terrible mistake. 

At this same luncheon that the Senator 
from Kentucky mentioned, a number 
of us went down the line and said: 
Mr. President, please don’t do this because 
if you do, it will make it even 
harder for us to take a step-by-step approach 
to immigration reform that enjoys 
bipartisan support. It will poison 
the well—not to mention the fact that 
what the President is proposing to do 
is unlawful and it will also make it 
harder for us to do the other things I 
have mentioned already that have bipartisan 
support. It will poison the 
well. 

Why in the world would the President 
want to do that at the start of a 
new Congress in the last 2 years of his 
term in office? Don’t you think he 
would want to have some legacy that 
he could point to in those last 2 years, 
saying: Well, I might have been dealt a 
tough political hand with Republican 
majorities in the House and the Senate, 
but we were actually able to be 
productive. 

I think that is why most Senators 
have come here—to be productive. 

So I would urge the President, as 
others have done, in the very strongest 
of terms to abandon his plan for this 
Executive amnesty and to heed the 
message—the very clear message—voters 
sent last Tuesday. After a 6-year 
experiment in unfettered liberalism 
and big-government policies, the American 
people are asking for a new direction. 
I am not under any illusion that 
all of a sudden they have fallen in love 
with my side of the aisle. That is not 
true. But what they are willing to do is 
put us on probation and give us all a 
chance to demonstrate that we can 
change our course, we can listen to the 
American people, and we can do things 
together that they want to see us do. 

My constituents—6.5 million Tex-
ans—are sick and tired of watching the 
Federal Government waste their 
money, selectively enforce the law, and 
try to micromanage their lives as if the 
Federal Government knows better than 

they do what is good for them and 
their families. It is not true, and they 
know it, but that has not stopped the 
efforts over the last 6 years. 

What my constituents want, I believe—
and I believe it because they 
have told me this—they want leaders 
who will respond to their practical day-
to-day concerns, leaders who appreciate 
and will address the biggest 
threats to the American dream, leaders 
who will uphold the timeless principles 
of our Constitution. 

I believe there is a nascent, bipartisan, 
emerging consensus here that we 
can actually do this. This is not too 
hard for us to do. Yes, I have read what 
some of the pundits have said. They 
said it is going to be even worse with 
Republicans in charge. Well, it better 
not be worse or there will be a heavy 
price to pay, and most of that will be 
paid by the American people, who will 
not be well-served if we simply refuse 
to change and if we refuse to listen. 
And that goes for the President, that 
goes for Republicans, and that goes for 
Democrats. 

So for my part and I believe for our 
part on this side of the aisle, we are 
eager to work together to solve our 
country’s problems, to help unleash 
this great American job-creating engine 
known as our economy, and to restore 
the rule of law and constitutional 
government. As for President Obama, 
we can only hope he decides to work 
with us rather than against us and 
against the best intentions and desires 
of the American people. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor.

KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE 
Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I was 
hoping to catch the Senator before he 
left the floor because I wanted to ask 
him—and I am not sure he is going to 
slip back in here, but I was going to 
ask him if he thought maybe—because 
I agree with him that that new approach 
to bipartisanship could start 
today. I do not think we have to necessarily 
wait until January. There are 
some of us who have been ready, who 
have worked in a bipartisan way, literally 
for years, getting very important 
things done for our Nation. I am 


S5888 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE November 12, 2014 

sorry the Senator slipped away. I am 
sure he has some other pressing business. 
I wanted to ask him—and I absolutely 
agree with him on the priorities 
he just laid out. I think he just said the 
American people want us to act and to 
act together in their interests. 

I think I heard him say that on the 
top of his list, what he is particularly 
anxious to work on is the Keystone XL 
Pipeline, the expedited export of natural 
gas. I think he said it was important 
for jobs in America, helping to 
strengthen the middle class, sending a 
very positive signal to them that we 
heard them in this election; that he 
was troubled about the falling median 
household income and wants to do 
something to raise it. And I think I 
heard him say he was concerned or 
that he was—how shall I say it?—he 
was thinking that some of these things 
would really push Putin back on his 
heels. I have been one of the ones sanctioned 
by President Putin, and there 
are a few others who are on that list, so 
I have been of that mind for a while. 

I think he also referred to Ted Kennedy, 
one of our dear friends who 
mentored many of us—not just Democrats 
but Republicans as well—with his 
straightforwardness, his honesty, his 
passion, his capacity for extraordinary 
work, and his willingness to work 
across party lines. As the Senator from 
Texas pointed out, there was a great 
partnership between Senator Kennedy 
and Senator ENZI, and he talked about 
the 80–20 rule; let’s agree on 80 percent. 
‘‘We might not agree on everything, 
but let’s move forward’’ I think were 
his words on the 80 percent on which 
we do agree. 

So I want to come to the floor today 
to ask Senator CORNYN from Texas particularly 
and Senator MCCONNELL and 
Senator REID and others if they will 
join me in moving forward on the Keystone 
XL Pipeline. 

This has been a project that has lingered 
far too long. It is clearly supported 
by 60 or more Members of this 
body. It is a piece of legislation that 
has been endorsed by the new to-be majority 
leader, as a cosponsor and a leading 
cosponsor of the legislation. 

There are a significant number of 
Democrats on that legislation. I believe 
with a significant push in the 
next few hours we could actually get 
the votes we need to pass the Keystone 
Pipeline. In an hour or so, at the request 
of the minority, I am going to 
wait for about an hour and then I am 
going to propose a unanimous consent 
to do exactly that—to set up 2 hours of 
debate tonight after the vote and then 
have a vote on the Keystone Pipeline 
tomorrow. I believe it is the time to 
act. 

I believe we should take the new majority 
leader at his word and stop 
blocking legislation that is broadly 
supported by the American public and 
has been for quite some time. I want to 
say yes to the new majority leader 
MITCH MCCONNELL. The time to start is 
now. The public has clearly spoken. I 

believe we can move forward on several 
important pieces of legislation. 

Senator REID mentioned the Marketplace 
Fairness Act. That is another 
very important piece of legislation 
that I believe needs to be moved 
through. With a little push right now, 
it could get done. It would be a significant 
boost to businesses and retail that 
are being hurt every day by our inaction. 
My comments are going to be 
about the Keystone Pipeline because I 
am chair of the energy committee for 
the Senate. I am going to do everything 
in my power, here and at home 
on the campaign trail where I am still 
in a runoff, as you know, to get this 
project moving forward. 

One of the extraordinary facts about 
the Keystone Pipeline is not what it is. 
I am going to talk about that in a 
minute and what it does. One of the 
most extraordinary pieces of argument 
for why we should pass it is the unprecedented 
coalition that supports it. 
There are other bills that have a longer 
list of supporters. There are bills that 
have pages and pages of lists. This particular 
bill has a relatively short list of 
organizations, but they are extremely 
powerful and diverse, which makes it 
compelling and I think it makes us—or 
should make us—want to understand 
and respond to this coalition. 

I am going to read their names. I 
have some time to do this before I call 
for unanimous consent to pass the 
original Hoeven-Landrieu Keystone 
bill, which is a stand-alone Keystone 
bill as originally introduced with 45 
Republican cosponsors. Every Member 
of the Republican caucus is already a 
cosponsor of this bill, and we have on 
that bill about 12 Democratic cosponsors. 
I am confident we have the additional 
votes necessary to pass it. 

The American Chemistry Council, 
the American Concrete Pipe Association, 
the American Exploration and 
Production Council, the American 
Highway Users Alliance, the American 
Petroleum Institute, the American 
Road & Transportation Builders, American 
Truckers Association, Associated 
General Contractors of America, Association 
of Oil Pipelines, Concrete Reinforcing 
Steel Institute, Distribution 
Contractors Association, Independent 
Petroleum Association of America, Industrial 
Minerals Association of North 
America, Institute for 21st Century Energy, 
International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers, Laborers International 
Union of North America. 

Let me stop there and make a point. 
Many bills passed here or attempted to 
pass here either have a list of all business 
organizations or all labor organizations 
or all environmental organizations 
or all highway contractors. 

This bill has such an extraordinary, 
diverse group of some of the strongest 
business leaders in the country. I want 
to underscore to my Democratic colleagues 
who are supporting this piece 
of legislation, tremendous support 
from labor unions because labor 
unions, like business leaders, want 

jobs. They want profits. They want 
success. They want more investment in 
business, creating good middle-class 
jobs. The difference between the oil and 
gas industry, which I have been pleased 
to be a strong advocate for in many different 
facets, is that industry does 
produce the kinds of jobs Americans 
truly want, not minimum wage jobs, 
not just slightly above minimum wage 
but jobs that in my State—the Senator 
knows this because he is well aware of 
this—start at $60,000, $70,000, $85,000 for 
a young man or a young woman coming 
out of high school or trade school, 
let alone college. 

These are very important jobs. That 
is why labor unions are represented 
here. Along with Portland Cement Association, 
the plastics industry, the 
United Association of Journeymen and 
Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe 
Fitting Industry, the Business Round-
table, American Supply Association, 
American Iron and Steel Institute, National 
Association of Manufacturers, 
National Electrical Contractors Association, 
National Roofing Contractors. 

Why would roofing contractors be 
supporting the Keystone Pipeline? 
There are no roofs on a pipelines, but 
there are thousands of roofs over workers 
needed to build a pipeline. All along 
the route of this pipeline will be increases 
in populations of housing, industrial 
sites, retail, residential, supporting 
over 40,000 workers to build 
this pipeline. The North American Die 
Casting Association, the National Utility 
Contractors—again, associated 
businesses—the U.S. Oil & Gas Association 
and, finally, Steel Manufacturers 
Association and Western Alliance. 

This is an extraordinary coalition 
that has come together to support the 
Hoeven-Landrieu bill. The bill I am 
going to call up in a few minutes for 
unanimous consent to pass because I 
believe what the new majority leader 
has said. I believe what Senator CORNYN 
has just said. I believe what the 
current majority leader said, soon to 
be minority leader in the next Congress, 
that we need to work together 
and that we can work together, and we 
need to begin to do that today—not tomorrow, 
not in January, not in February, 
not in March, not around the 
corner, not next week but today. That 
would send the most positive signal. I 
am not asking to have unanimous consent 
on 10 bills that are controversial. 
I am not asking us to do the impossible. 
I am not asking us to do something 
that just came up last week. I am 
asking us to move forward on a bill 
that has labor support, business support, 
general contractor support, and 
most importantly the American people. 
The latest polls on the Keystone Pipeline, 
not just in my state—I see my colleague 
from West Virginia—and not 
just in West Virginia but polls in this 
country from California to New York, 
to Michigan, to Pennsylvania, to Ohio, 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5889 

to Florida, and to Texas. Overwhelmingly 
Democrats, Republicans—not everyone—
but there is overwhelming support 
to build the Keystone Pipeline because 
Americans want jobs. American 
families deserve good-paying jobs. In 
addition, Americans are tired of bowing 
to Mideast powers or to Russian 
dictators about what our future is 
going to be. Americans are proud. We 
want to stand proud. We believe the 
Keystone Pipeline is an important first 
step. It is a signal. It is a symbol that 
represents American energy power. It 
is a symbol moving past gridlock. It is 
a deliverable on promises we have all 
made. Yes, we will work together. Yes, 
but that will start later. Yes, we will 
work together, but it will be next year. 
Yes, we will work together, but it will 
be in the spring. Yes, we will work together, 
but we can’t pass Keystone unless 
we pass these 10 other things. 

There is always going to be tomorrow. 
There is always going to be 10 
other things. Let’s act today, tomorrow. 
We can do this. We can pass the 
Keystone Pipeline and answer the frustrations 
of the American people so 
they can rest next week and say: Oh, 
my gosh. The Senators of the United 
States of America have ears. They have 
brains. They have hearts. They heard 
what we said and we can do this. We 
have a bill that is on the calendar. 

I have also passed a similar bill 
through my committee, but I am not 
even asking you to pass the bill I 
passed through my committee, which I 
think is slightly better than the one on 
the calendar, but we can all compromise 
here. I am also the cosponsor 
of the bill, lead sponsor of the bill, that 
is on the Senate calendar. It doesn’t 
have to go through a committee. It basically 
technically already has. It is 
ready for a vote. We have the 60 votes 
to pass it. 

I am going to recognize in just a 
minute the Senator from West Virginia. 
I will ask the Senator a question 
because only the Chair can recognize, 
but I would like to ask the Senator 
from West Virginia, does any of this 
make sense to him. I don’t know if he 
was down here. Although I am sure he 
was in his office listening to the comments 
of the majority leader, the soon-
to-be majority leader, and the good 
Senator from Texas saying now is the 
time to work together. I don’t know if 
the Senator heard that. Does the Senator 
think that maybe this bill would 
be the bill to start moving us from 
gridlock to doing the job for the American 
people? 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen


ator of West Virginia. 

Mr. MANCHIN. I thank the Chair. 

My good friend, the Senator from 
Louisiana, has been working on this for 
many years—I think even before I 
came up. I have been here 4 years now. 
When I first came, I talked to Senator 
LANDRIEU, my friend from Louisiana, 
and asked her about this and basically 
I think she explained to me at the time 
that first of all the sovereign nation of 

Canada, the country, was going to 
produce it so we had no say in the production 
of this product. It is going to 
be produced. Next of all, it is going to 
go somewhere because there is demand 
for the product in the marketplace. 
There is a demand for it. 

With all that being said, it didn’t 
take me too long to reply to the Senator, 
she will recall, 4 years ago, that 
in West Virginia we have common 
sense and we have good people like 
Louisiana and we felt if this product is 
going to be sold and we are buying this 
type of a product around the world, 
then why wouldn’t we buy from our 
friends versus the enemies we have supplied 
resources to, to be used against 
us? That is the one that resonates with 
West Virginians. I know it resonates 
with Louisianians. The other thing is I 
understand there are 1,000 American 
companies in West Virginia—not to say 
what you have been able to do and help 
the people in Louisiana, all the jobs 
they have gotten from this, it would be 
a tremendous windfall for all of us if it 
is something we can count on. 

I can’t for the life of me understand 
why we haven’t to date been able to 
move this piece of legislation forward. 
I did hear both the minority leader and 
the majority leader and the minority 
whip and majority whip talk about it is 
time for us to start working together. 

There is not a better piece of legislation 
to show that we heard the results 
of Tuesday’s election. We heard. If we 
heard nothing more from that roar of 
Americans, whether they voted or 
didn’t vote, they basically told us do 
something. Start doing what we are 
supposed to do. Start governing. Do 
something. We may not agree with 
you, but we would like to see this open 
dialogue, this transparency, this beautiful 
body, the Senate, that the whole 
world watches. But when they see us 
doing nothing—it is not something we 
are very good at or look very good 
doing. That day is gone. 

I would ask my Senate colleagues 
that if they would be so kind as to give 
us a chance to show me we are starting 
anew. 

We are going to have a piece of legislation 
that is going to help us be more 
secure as a nation, and that is why I 
am here. I wish to hear the Senator’s 
comments. 

The security of our Nation—the Senator 
has been here. She has been seeing 
what has been going on, the demand we 
had for foreign oil, what it has done to 
us, the areas of the world it has taken 
us to, and the amount of resources we 
have spent in blood and treasure fighting 
for resources—whether people believe 
it or not. This is a chance for us 
to secure that. So if the Senator could 
talk to us about that. 

Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator from 
West Virginia is so right in focusing 
this debate at this moment on the subject 
of national security because Veterans 
Day was just celebrated by all of 
us yesterday. We all participated in 
Veterans Day events. 

So it pains me to say this, but I am 
going to give us all of the facts—and 
the Senator knows this—that this 
country imports 340 million barrels 
today. Iraq exports 340,000 barrels of oil 
per day. That is Iraq—blood and treasure. 
We have left men and women—not 
left them on the battlefield—but they 
have died there, and we have many soldiers 
here at home. 

Canada—which is a friendly country, 
an ally of ours—with the Keystone 
Pipeline, would bring in 870,000 barrels 
into the United States. So the American 
people sit here and think: OK, 
what is wrong with this picture? We 
could be taking oil from our friend, 
Canada, creating jobs in North America—
good-paying jobs—not only building 
the pipeline but maintaining the 
pipeline. 

This pipeline doesn’t come to Louisiana. 
I fought for it like a tiger, and 
the pipeline doesn’t even come to my 
State. It goes to Texas. Now, I have refineries 
in Louisiana, and Louisiana 
most certainly and the companies in 
Louisiana will benefit. This pipeline 
doesn’t connect Canada and Louisiana; 
it connects Canada and Texas. 

I am sorry that the majority leader 
and the Senator from Texas had to 
scamper off the floor. I am sure he had 
a meeting to go to. But this is really 
about refineries in Texas that are waiting 
for this oil and about moving this 
oil, as the Senator knows, through the 
most safe means possible to these refineries—
off of the highways, off of the 
railroads, and supporting a relationship 
with Canada as opposed to countries 
in other parts of the world that 
don’t always share our values and that 
we have to spend a lot of our defense 
money protecting. 

So this makes no sense, and that is 
why I think this pipeline has such 
overwhelming bipartisan support 
across the country. 

Mr. MANCHIN. I think that basically 
the Senator touched on something very 
important and we want to go back to 
that—transportation of the oil today. 
The oil is coming down into the refineries 
anyway. We have had some explosions 
by our rail carriers. It is coming 
by truck, and it is coming in so many 
different forms. We have been told this 
is the safest way to transport. 

When people talk about safe transport, 
we know this was not the first 
pipeline we have in America. I think if 
you ever look at a map—the Senator 
has had the map on the floor—there is 
a crisscross. We have pipelines all 
across America, and I think that is the 
perfect map to see. 

So the bottom line is it is something 
we have done. If we take it in the 
harshest environment in Alaska, the 
Alaskan pipeline—that means so much 
to us in America—it has been done in 
the harshest of environments and has 
been done safely. So I am concerned 
about that. 

I am also concerned with—the Senator 
talked about it directly going to 
Texas, but you all benefit; everyone 
benefits. 


S5890 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE November 12, 2014 

Ms. LANDRIEU. Everyone benefits. 

Mr. MANCHIN. The other thing I 
wanted to say is this. I know the Senator 
was in parades yesterday, and I 
can only imagine her schedule. It has 
to be unbelievable. But with all that 
said, people still want jobs. All they 
want is jobs and an opportunity to 
work with certainty. This gives Americans 
a lot of certainty about jobs and 
future economic growth in our country. 


Ms. LANDRIEU. Absolutely. 

This morning, to prepare for offering 
this unanimous consent request—which 
I will do in a very short period of time 
and ask for a couple of hours of debate 
tonight and then tomorrow—I spoke to 
the leader of the building trades council 
for the United States of America. 
He was very strong in his words to me 
about how disappointed he has been 
with some Members who have not 
stood up for building trades. 

These are men and women who work 
in every State. All they want to do is 
go to work and have jobs. He was extremely 
disappointed in the gridlock 
over this piece of legislation, and that 
is exactly what he said to me. He said: 
Senator, we are about fed up with elections 
and politics because what my 
members want are jobs. That is what 
their families want, and they are tired 
of fooling around with some commonsense 
projects that would bring so 
much wealth to middle-class families. 

I know that the majority leader on 
our side is concerned about the flat 
line of middle-class income in this 
country, and I know his heart is working 
toward increasing income for all 
families. This is the first step. Not only 
is the project itself going to generate 
huge amounts of jobs and economic activity—
and I am going to put that 
amount in the record. It is estimated 
to be $20 billion. It is slightly less than 
the size of the entire State of 
Vermont’s GDP. This one project is 
like the output of one of our States— 
albeit a small State—but Vermont is 
an important State. I have never in my 
life seen a project with so much economic 
benefit. 

I have never seen an infrastructure 
project supported from a broader 
base—from the left to the center to the 
right. I have never seen labor and business 
come together in my life as they 
have on this issue. I have never seen so 
many Senators cosponsor a bill and 
yet—because of something I can’t quite 
put my finger on—we haven’t yet 
passed. We can do that now, today or 
tomorrow, and that would send a very 
positive signal that we have heard the 
voters, that we do understand this cry 
for breaking the gridlock, moving forward 
together, and getting the job 
done. 

I could not think of a better bill that 
symbolizes what we are trying to do in 
terms of jobs, economic security, energy 
security, and looking to the future 
in our country than this bill. It 
would build this pipeline, get this oil— 
which is going to be produced any-

way—off of the rails, off of our highways, 
and into refineries. 

May I say, as the Senator from West 
Virginia knows, and the Senator from 
North Dakota, who is my right hand 
with the Senator from West Virginia, 
we have additional pipelines to build 
because we have to build these east-
west. The real need for the supply is 
the west coast and the east coast. 

As the Senator knows, you could 
produce all the oil and gas you want or 
all the energy, and produce and generate 
the power, but if you can’t move 
it to the places where it needs to be, it 
is as if you haven’t produced it. 

I know something about this subject 
as chair of the energy committee. So 
after we do Keystone, which we are 
going to do tomorrow, we have to build 
some other pipelines that go east and 
west. 

This is only to take 10 percent of 
North Dakota’s supply. North Dakota 
has become the leading supplier of oil 
and gas in the country. I wish to talk 
about North Dakota for 1 minute. I 
can’t do it justice, such as Senator 
HEITKAMP can do it, but I heard her 
give this speech enough to be able to 
repeat it, and it is worth repeating. 

The Senator from Texas just came to 
the floor and lamented: Oh, my gosh, 
what can we do to lift the middle class? 
How can we lift their economic outlook? 


The Senators, all three of them, 
came and asked that question. I gave 
them an answer: Build the Keystone 
Pipeline. Do they know what is happening 
in North Dakota? It might be a 
sparsely populated State, but it has 
now surpassed every State in the production 
of oil. 

The other thing they do is they took 
their energy production, No. 36 on a 
scale of 1 to 50—they were the poorest 
State. The Senator from West Virginia 
would know where they are today. Do 
we know where they are in 4 years? 
They have moved from 36 to 6. Think 
about that. I want to let that sink in 
for just 1 minute. North Dakota moved 
their number from 36 out of 50 to 6 out 
of 50 in 4 years. 

Now, I challenge any Senator from 
any part of this country or any political 
leaning to come down to this floor 
in the next 24 hours and show me one 
piece of legislation, one tax cut, one 
jobs bill that could move a State in 4 
years or a group of States from 36 to 6. 
That is the power of this industry, and 
we are standing in its way. 

It is shameful, it is wrong, and it 
must stop today. If people want to 
hide, they are going to have a hard 
time. 

I want everybody to hear clearly this 
is not a time to hide, not a time to sit 
down, and not a time to play games. It 
is a time to stand. We already have 
enough votes to pass this bill. We have 
45—we have every single Republican, 
none of whom are on the floor now. 
Every single Republican of this Chamber 
is a cosponsor of this bill on which 
I am going to ask unanimous consent. 

So I would think very carefully before 
anyone objects because they are all cosponsors 
on the bill. Think hard before 
you do. 

Mr. MANCHIN. Senator, if I could 
just touch on one thing because we 
have here our good friend Senator 
TESTER of Montana, who also knows a 
thing or two about an energy-producing 
State. 

I think on the environment, you 
touched on that. Most people believe 
that people who come from energy 
States throw caution to the wind on 
environmental issues. There is no one 
in this body—I don’t believe on either 
side of the aisle—who doesn’t want the 
best for themselves, their children, 
families, and future generations. 

With that being said, I think this 
pipeline has passed every hurdle the 
environmental community—rightfully 
so—has put out so that we should make 
sure we were protecting the environment 
and trying to find a balance between 
the environment and the economics, 
if you will. The economy is so 
vitally important. I don’t know if there 
is any environmental impact study 
standing in the way that would prevent 
this. 

Ms. LANDRIEU. I agree with the 
Senator. I think he is absolutely correct. 
The Senator from Montana knows 
this as well. The Senator from Montana 
also has an issue that I will ask 
him to explain in just a moment—he 
knows it better than I do—about private 
property rights, because he negotiated 
the language in the bill. 

But responding to the question of the 
Senator from West Virginia about the 
environment, that is what is so exciting 
about this project, so compelling 
for us to move forward. Not only did 
the international study that was done 
say it is in our international interests, 
of course, to trade with our best and 
most friendly trading partner closest 
to us that enjoys the same high quality 
standard of life that we do and even 
higher environmental standards, but 
the environmental study that came in, 
conducted by the President’s own administration—
this wasn’t done previously—
came back and concluded this 
is the safest way to move it and it is 
the most environmentally friendly way 
to move it, and that is the record. 

So the Senator is right. Not only 
does it have a compelling economic argument, 
but it has a compelling environmental 
argument from that perspective. 


I would ask the Senator from Montana 
if he could explain the very important 
language that is in the Landrieu-
Hoeven bill that is cosponsored 
by every single Republican and this 
chairman and that is about the language 
he negotiated on private property 
rights, because this is a very important 
principle for many Republicans 
but also for many Democrats, particularly 
in Louisiana, where we have a lot 
of private property. In West Virginia 
you have a lot of private property. In 
Montana you have a lot of private but 
also some public lands. 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5891 

Would the Senator answer that question 
if he would. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Montana. 

Mr. TESTER. I thank the Senator 
from Louisiana and the Senator from 
West Virginia. I have a few things to 
say, and I will do so very quickly. But 
since this is the first time we have 
been on the floor since the election, I 
think the American people are frustrated 
with the ways things work in 
Washington—enough political games. 

They told us that Americans want 
lawmakers to compromise, to work together, 
and to get things done. 

Americans told us they want a 
stronger economy with good-paying 
jobs. It shouldn’t have taken an election 
to get this message through, but it 
did. Nationwide, including my State of 
Montana, it is fair to say the unemployment 
rate is down, but it is also 
fair to say wages are not where they 
need to be. Too many Americans and 
too many Montanans are struggling to 
make ends meet. 

The Keystone XL Pipeline can help 
address some of those issues. But now 
we have another attempt to block consideration 
of this bipartisan bill written 
here by Senators LANDRIEU and 
HOEVEN. The votes are there. We know 
that. If there is one way we can create 
good-paying jobs right away, it is by 
approving and building this Keystone 
XL Pipeline. Building the pipeline 
would tell the American public that 
Washington is ready to turn the page. 
It will tell them we heard them, that 
their voices matter, and that Washington 
is reacting appropriately. 

Building the pipeline will strengthen 
our economy and our infrastructure. 
First, according to the State Department, 
building the pipeline will create 
16,000 jobs and support another 26,000 
more. Those are jobs that will help 
working-class Americans provide for 
their families. 

Secondly, the pipeline will include an 
on ramp for oil from the Bakken region 
of Montana and North Dakota, and let 
more energy go from our country to 
the marketplace, which is where it 
needs to go. With production in the 
Bakken continuing to boom, we need 
more options to get that American oil 
where it needs to be, and the XL Pipeline 
is where that needs to be. 

Third, shipping oil by pipeline is the 
safest way to ship it. That is a fact. 
And the safety of American families 
and communities must come first. 

Fourth, building the pipeline means 
more business with Canada, our friend 
to the north, and less business with the 
Middle East—folks who don’t like us. 
Our country continues to be involved 
in conflicts in the Middle East. By continuing 
to do more business with our 
neighbors to the north, as opposed to 
countries that don’t share our world 
view, we can help cut off the funds to 
those who work against us. I think the 
Keystone Pipeline is a big step toward 
creating that energy security. 

The pipeline must be built right. I 
will get to the point Senator LANDRIEU 

talked about. It must be constructed 
with respect to private property rights. 
We cannot have foreign corporations 
using eminent domain to run roughshod 
over the fields of a farmer in Montana 
or a business owner in Nebraska 
or over sacred tribal lands. The respect 
for private property rights is in the 
Landrieu-Hoeven bill. It is not in the 
House bill. It is a critical component. 
It has to be, otherwise we are making 
a huge mistake. 

This pipeline also must be built to 
the highest safety standards. There can 
be no corners cut. Leaks and spills 
don’t make anybody any money. They 
are unacceptable. The most modern 
safety systems must be employed, including 
double piping, if necessary. 
That is a fundamental difference between 
the Landrieu-Hoeven bill—what 
they have drafted in the House and the 
good work we have done in the Senate. 
The House bill contains no protections 
for landowners. None. Zip. 

The House bill says: Good luck, landowners. 
You are subject to eminent domain 
by a foreign corporation. You 
have no spill prevention protections. 
The Landrieu-Hoeven bill, on the other 
hand, protects rural America, protects 
private property rights. 

Senator LANDRIEU has been working 
on this effort for years. This bill will 
give the pipeline the Senate’s seal of 
approval and it will send a signal to all 
Americans that Congress is working 
together creating good jobs, supporting 
our economy, and that we are able to 
make responsible decisions. 

But as this debate moves forward, I 
will continue to push to make sure the 
oil shipped through this pipeline stays 
in America. I have heard the arguments 
on all sides, but North America’s 
oil should stay in North America. 
It will make our country more energy 
secure. It will lead to cheaper energy 
that will be more affordable for our 
homes, for our businesses, and for our 
working families. That will lead to 
more good manufacturing jobs in this 
country. Because of our energy costs, 
we will be able to recruit that manufacturing 
base back to our country 
that we gave up some 20 or 30 years 
ago. 

There are a lot of reasons to approve 
and build the Keystone XL Pipeline. It 
will support our middle class—and we 
need to support our middle class—it 
will make us more energy secure; and 
it will strengthen our transportation 
and infrastructure system. 

But America needs a sign. It needs a 
reason to trust that Congress and 
Washington as a whole are listening. 
Approving the pipeline with the needed 
protections and with respect to private 
property rights is that sign. I, like the 
American people, am tired of the gridlock 
and tired of kicking the can down 
the road. I didn’t come here to delay 
and push our problems to the future. I 
came here to work for commonsense 
solutions we can enact today and move 
this country forward today. The Keystone 
XL Pipeline is one of those solutions. 


Passing this bill and building this 
pipeline is one of those very important 
things we need to do for our infrastructure, 
for our energy security, and for 
the country as a whole. I encourage my 
colleagues to support and help us rebuild 
our trust with the American people. 


With that, I turn it back to the good 
Senator from West Virginia, Mr. 
MANCHIN. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from West Virginia. 

Mr. MANCHIN. Let me say the Senator 
from Montana, and all of us— 
there are quite a few of us—are on this 
bill for a reason. It is about the opportunities 
for jobs that we have. And it 
doesn’t have an environmental detriment 
to our country. That has already 
been proven. So with all of this, 
what is the hangup? Why can’t we get 
this vote we are hoping to get by tomorrow 
at the latest? 

I can only talk about the jobs with 
the thousand American companies that 
are providing the goods it takes to 
build this pipeline. I have a chance in 
West Virginia—we are doing an awful 
lot of the work right now because we 
come from an energy State that does 
an awful lot of the support work for 
any type of energy throughout the 
country and around the world. But the 
bottom line is, again, if you are going 
to have a secure nation, you have to 
have control of your own destiny. This 
gives us the control we don’t have, it 
gives us the ability to say, listen, we 
may not have to go around the world 
and engage in the different conflicts we 
see going on right now. That is what 
we are talking about. 

So the security of the Nation, I 
think, is the most important thing 
Keystone does, is it helps us be more 
secure with the greatest trading partner 
we have. Canada is the best and the 
largest trading partner for 35 States 
out of the 50. People take jaunts all 
over the world trying to develop a market 
here and there. But when it comes 
down to it, the No. 1 trading partner 
for 35 States is Canada. And Canada is 
working with us. 

I know Canada has pressure from 
around the world to go somewhere else. 
So if we have the best partner—the 
best outlook we have ever had or can 
imagine—working with us to help develop 
this product the whole world 
seems to need and want and we need in 
America, why not have control? 

The Senator from Louisiana talked 
about this. Why shouldn’t we bring 
that oil into America and do all the 
heavy lifting and then ship it somewhere 
else? It is supply and demand. 
When you have control of supply, when 
you have the supply in your own back 
yard—and there might be demand, but 
you have a need also within our country—
that gives a pretty good hand to 
play. That is what we are saying. Why 
would we let any of these advantages 
be turned to a disadvantage? 

The only thing I can do is hope we 
can get this vote. And I would say to 


S5892 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE November 12, 2014 

my good friends on the other side of 
the aisle, my Republican colleagues, 
this would be the best gesture to move 
the ball forward. This would be the 
best gesture they could make, coming 
off of the changes, the shift we saw 
from Tuesday’s election. People are 
speaking. They want us to work. It is 
the same for the Senator from Montana, 
the same for the Presiding Officer. 
They want us to do something. 
They want us to work. 

We are not going to agree all the 
time with people. The best we can do is 
try. We had a football game we played 
the other day at WVU. We played TCU. 
We were ahead. We should have won 
the game. Going into the last half of 
the fourth quarter, for some reason the 
play calling wasn’t as aggressive as it 
had been the first three quarters. We 
sat on the ball and we got beat 31 to 30. 
People don’t want us to sit on the ball 
in the Senate. 

It is time for us to do something. It 
is time for us to move forward. After 
Tuesday’s election, we can work together. 
We have heard you loud and 
clear. We are willing to take a vote. We 
know the environment will be protected. 
We know we can find a balance 
between the environment and the economy. 
We know we can reap thousands 
and thousands and thousands of jobs 
and put millions and millions of dollars 
into the economy. That is what we do 
know. 

There will still be some people who 
don’t support this piece of legislation, 
and they have all their reasons to 
speak about that. But give us a reason 
to vote for something that will help 
America and help our States individually. 
That is what we are asking for. 
That is what the good Senator has been 
fighting for since the day I have been 
here. 

Senator LANDRIEU being the chairman 
of the energy committee has made 
a difference from my standpoint, looking 
at our energy policy as a whole. 
But how do we keep the United States 
of America secure and out of troubled 
spots in the world? I appreciate her efforts 
on this, and I look forward to 
working with her on this. I endorsed 
the bill, I am a cosponsor, and I will 
definitely proudly vote for this piece of 
legislation as soon as we can get it on 
the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Louisiana. 

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I see 
the Senator from North Dakota has arrived, 
and of course she wants to speak 
and can do so beautifully because this 
pipeline comes through her State, as I 
said. But I do want to respond to a few 
things and thank the Senator from 
West Virginia. 

I have heard colleagues, particularly 
my colleague from California, say this 
often, and she says it in committee and 
on the floor. And even though she and 
I are on opposite sides of this debate, 
we have worked together on some important 
legislation for our country, 
and I have such respect for her leader


ship on the RESTORE Act, which was 
an amazing piece of environmental legislation 
for our gulf coast States. Without 
her leadership it would not have 
happened. But I have heard her say 
over and over and over again that elections 
have consequences, and this one 
does, just as they all do. And one of the 
consequences of this election is that a 
clear path for Keystone has been 
opened up. 

The reporters following this legislation, 
which they have followed very 
carefully, know exactly what I am 
talking about when I say a path for 
passage has been cleared. In my view, 
that path will never, ever be clearer 
than it is today. Now in order for the 
path to stay clear, and it is crystal 
clear today, politics must be set aside. 
Gamesmanship has to be set aside. We 
must come together to do what is right 
for the country, for the American people, 
and to vote. 

There are strong feelings, I know, 
against this bill. There have been for 
many years. But the overwhelming majority 
of this body—60-plus Members— 
has indicated support for this legislation. 
And the Senate bill, from the perspective 
we just heard—from private 
property rights, for clarity, for simplicity—
is far superior to the House 
bill that has been passed. 

The House is very agile—very agile. 
They can do lots of things quickly that 
the Senate can’t do. So the House may 
decide to take the language of this bill, 
pass it, and call it something else. I understand 
that. I don’t know if that is 
what they will do, but there is a clear 
path for victory on Keystone. 
Whoever’s name is on the bill does not 
matter to me as long as it gets done. I 
want to say that again. The name on 
the bill does not matter to me as long 
as this gets done. And it needs to get 
done right now—not in January, not in 
February, not in March. 

It doesn’t need to be combined with 
anything else. It needs to get done on 
its own, because it is standing alone. It 
will go to the President’s desk as a 
stand-alone. I believe the President 
will have to make an important decision. 
I am hoping he will sign it. But if 
he doesn’t, that is the process. I hope 
he will, and I will be urging him to do 
so because his administration—his 
State Department, his EPA, and his 
Transportation Department—has urged 
him to support this piece of legislation 
for the strength of our economy, a signal 
to our allies, and to strengthen 
America here and abroad. I would 
strongly urge him to sign it. 

We have a job to do in the Senate, 
the President has a job to do, and the 
House has a job to do. But if everybody 
would stop playing games with this bill 
and think about what the American 
people said on election day and stop 
trying to push one philosophy or one 
person ahead of the other, we can get 
this done. 

My name is not even first on this 
bill. Senator HOEVEN’s name is first. It 
is a Hoeven bill. I am the lead Demo


cratic sponsor because I am the chair 
of the energy committee, and I will be 
until January 2. If my voters send me 
back, I will be here for 6 more years. 
That is why my name is on the bill, because 
I chair the committee. But if 
they want to take my name off, put 
somebody’s else name on it and pass it, 
so be it. I didn’t come here to see my 
name in lights. I came here to create 
jobs for my State and for this country, 
and I believe I have done an excellent 
job in the 18 years I have been here, 
through very difficult circumstances, 
and will continue should the voters 
want me to. 

Today we need to talk about the Keystone 
Pipeline, and nobody can speak 
better of this than the Senator from 
North Dakota. I wish to line this up before 
she speaks, because she was traveling 
and she just landed. She might 
not have heard what all three leaders 
said when they came to the floor. Senator 
REID, Senator CORNYN, and Senator 
MCCONNELL said their No. 1 goal 
was to break gridlock, and they wanted 
to start now. Their second goal was to 
expand middle-class job opportunities 
and create wealth in America. 

So I am hoping the Senator from the 
State that has created the most wealth 
in the shortest period of time of any 
State of the Union might express to 
the rest of us actually how that happened 
and why she thinks this Keystone 
Pipeline and other pipelines—because 
she and I agree, this is just the 
first of several we are going to have to 
lay down to make America a super-
energy power. We don’t become a 
superenergy power by just wishing it; 
we become a superenergy power by putting 
in the infrastructure that makes 
it possible. Even kids in second grade 
understand this. We have to put up 
windmills, we have to put up solar panels, 
we have to put in pipelines, we 
have to put in highways. 

The Senator from North Dakota, who 
has a very sparsely populated State, 
understands the issue of this infrastructure 
I think better than any Senator 
in this body. So I am going to ask 
her if she would respond to that and 
maybe elaborate on the question: How 
did her State get so wealthy in the last 
few years? 

My State is doing well. I am not here 
complaining. My State is doing beautifully. 
Our unemployment in south 
Louisiana is 3 percent, so we are 
blessed because we are an energy State. 
We are proud of it. We are creating jobs 
hand over fist. But there are places 
such as Detroit, there are places in 
Ohio, there are places in Pennsylvania 
and New York and New Mexico and 
other places where people are unemployed, 
begging for work, willing to 
work. Three leaders came to the floor 
and said: It is time to break gridlock. 
Here is a project that can do it. So I 
hope to see them sometime before close 
of business tonight. 

Would the Senator expound on that? 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
HEINRICH). The Senator from North Dakota. 



November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5893 

Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I 
stand with my great colleague and a 
great champion of this energy renaissance—
probably the greatest champion 
of the energy renaissance here in the 
Senate, the Senator from Louisiana. 

I wish to speak first about the election. 
I think all of us have had some 
time now to reflect, and I think the 
clearest message this entire body, as 
well as the entire U.S. Congress, received 
is: Stop fighting. Get your work 
done. I don’t think it could have been 
any clearer. 

We have an opportunity today to 
demonstrate we got that message, not 
in a partisan way, but in a bipartisan 
way—in a nonpartisan way—to say: We 
heard you loud and clear. It is time to 
do the job we were sent here to do, and 
that is to move legislation which 
moves this country forward. 

Senator LANDRIEU has expounded on 
the great opportunity of this energy 
renaissance, not just for this country 
but for the entire world. So let’s start 
with what is happening in North Dakota. 


We have had an explosion of oil and 
gas production. In fact, we have rapidly 
moved to second place in this country 
in oil production. We produce oil from 
oil shale. 

What does that mean? It means nothing 
if we can’t move the oil. It means 
nothing if we can’t get this product to 
the refineries and this product to market. 
We can produce all the oil we 
want, but part of what we need to address 
as we look at an energy infrastructure 
is how we move energy products. 


Today in America, and actually in 
Canada, how we are moving this product 
is by rail, which has created tremendous 
stress on our agricultural infrastructure. 
It has created tremendous 
stress on manufacturers who need to 
use those rails to haul their finished 
products. It has created tremendous 
stress for the railroads. Are they glad 
for the business? You bet. And has that 
created and opened up new markets for 
the oil production in my State? You 
bet. But the bottom line is, the best 
way we know how to move oil and 
move this product is in a pipe, and that 
is essential to building all this energy 
infrastructure. 

Why is it important? Let’s start first 
with the fact that we now are moving 
toward North American energy self-
sufficiency. A lot of people talk about 
America, and that is a great goal. But 
if we include our friends to the north— 
the people I grew up with, the people I 
know—I have been to the oil sands, I 
have been all over Alberta, I have been 
all over Saskatchewan. This is a very 
friendly country which has the longest 
contiguous border with which there has 
never been a conflict. We celebrate this 
in North Dakota with Peace Garden, 
which is a lovely park on both sides of 
the border where one can easily cross. 
We celebrate that. These are our 
friends. And if we are going to continue 
to build out this energy renaissance in 

North America, we had better be prepared 
to move this product. 

We all know some of the opposition 
to this has very little to do with the 
pipeline. It has to do with a concern 
about the increased availability of fossil 
fuels. This is still an economy that 
runs on fossil fuels. We have done tremendous 
work with fuel efficiency. We 
have done tremendous work with energy 
efficiency. But we are going to 
continue to use gasoline in our cars, we 
are going to continue to use diesel in 
our heavy equipment, and we are going 
to continue to use this product. 

Who do we want to buy this product 
from? If we ask any American person: 
Would you rather buy this product 
from Venezuela or would you rather 
buy this product from our friends to 
the north, Canada, I am pretty sure 
what their answer will be. 

So let’s talk a little bit about why 
the United States, at a time when we 
are seeing a global slowdown in economic 
progress for many of the other 
countries throughout the world—why 
is the United States seeming to go farther? 
Why are we producing and generating 
more wealth in our country than 
other places? I would tell you, it is because 
of this energy renaissance. We 
are doing something no one else is 
doing—we are producing our own oil 
and gas, we are developing the techniques 
to get this oil and gas out of the 
ground, and we are taking that as a 
raw material which is providing a renaissance, 
not just in the oil area but 
also in natural gas as a feedstock for 
many of our manufacturing processes. 
So we have a real opportunity here. 
But all of that goes away if we don’t 
move the product, if we don’t figure 
out a way to make sure our product 
gets to market. 

I will talk a little bit also about what 
this development in our country means 
to the world, when we are confronting 
great challenges in dealing with Russia, 
in looking at what is happening in 
the Middle East. We are confronting all 
of these challenges throughout the 
world. We know we can not only deploy 
our humanitarian efforts, our efforts 
by supporting through air strikes some 
of the work that is being done on the 
ground, but perhaps the single most 
important thing we can do is help provide 
oil and gas to Europe and to those 
countries dependent on people or on 
countries that are not our friends. 

We look at what our opportunities 
are today, and we know those opportunities 
are in the energy renaissance. 

So how do we move this product? 
How do we send a signal that we are 
ready to take advantage, both globally 
and domestically, of this product, of 
this renaissance in North America? We 
approve the Keystone Pipeline. 

A lot of people talk about what the 
Keystone Pipeline means to my State. 
It doesn’t exactly go into my State, 
but the Governor of Montana made 
sure when he was providing the permits 
that there wasn’t what I call an on 
ramp. There is a place where we can in 

fact access the Keystone Pipeline. We 
anticipate about 100,000 barrels a day of 
North Dakota crude will be able to be 
placed into the Keystone Pipeline and 
sent down to refineries in Louisiana. 
That may sound like a lot, but it is less 
than 10 percent of our current production. 


For me, the Keystone is so much 
more than this particular pipeline. It is 
a national discussion about our failing 
energy transportation infrastructure. 
That is what this is. And if we do not 
move this project forward, if we say no, 
what is the next thing? What is the 
next project that is essential? A 22-
mile pipeline in Massachusetts that 
would provide huge stability for the 
northeast in terms of their heat production. 
Twenty-two miles could be a 
huge benefit to our friends in Maine in 
terms of stabilizing their home heating 
costs this winter, but yet we fight the 
pipeline. 

Keystone is a huge advantage we 
have in this country because we are an 
oil and gas producer, and could potentially 
be an oil exporter, providing that 
source of soft power across the world. 
What do we do? We turn our back on 
the infrastructure that moves this 
product. So we have got to do everything 
we can to get this approved. 

I wish to turn briefly to the politics. 
A lot of people come here and talk politics. 
I believe this is the place to talk 
policy, and that is what I try to do. But 
for a moment, I wish to talk about the 
respect we should have for voters. I 
wish to talk about elections, and elections 
have consequences. One of the 
things we can do to begin to restore 
the public faith in our democracy and 
in the institution of the U.S. Congress 
is to do something bold to begin with: 
Actually move legislation that people 
have been waiting for for a long time, 
and actually respond to concerns. 

Maybe we get the votes, maybe we 
don’t. But let’s take a vote. Take a 
vote and get it done. Show the American 
public we are willing to come to 
this body, debate the great issues of 
the time, and bring things to a vote so 
they actually see us doing something; 
they actually get results. They pay our 
salary. We came here to vote. We came 
here to work. We came here to do 
something for the American public. 

We don’t all agree; there is no doubt 
about that. But the thing we should all 
agree on is it is essential in terms of 
providing certainty to the American 
public, confidence that the American 
public has in this body—that they see 
us on this floor, not 2 years or 2 
months from now, not 3 months from 
now, not 4 months from now, but 
today—the first day we are back in session 
after an election, a hard-fought 
election with pretty dire consequences 
for our side of the aisle, but a hard 
election. It is essential we send a message 
that we got the message and we 
take a vote. 

I am so proud of my colleague from 
Louisiana for coming back when, arguably, 
she should be back in her State 


S5894 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE November 12, 2014 

doing a little campaigning. But she is 
back here fighting for what she believes 
in and what she has always believed 
in, which is an energy infrastructure 
which makes a difference for 
North America, makes a difference for 
not just States such as mine but consumers 
of energy. 

I thank the Senator from Louisiana 
for her tremendous leadership on this 
and her willingness to basically come 
here and say: I don’t care who gets the 
credit. I don’t care if my name is on it 
or not. Let’s get the Keystone Pipeline 
approved. 

Now I want to make one final point 
and then I will close. If you have driven 
the route of the Keystone Pipeline, 
what you will see stockpiled every so 
many miles is thousands and thousands 
and thousands of dollars of pipe waiting—
6 years waiting—infrastructure 
that needs to go today. So when people 
say we can wait to take this vote, you 
are wrong. The sooner the better. The 
sooner we take this vote and get it approved, 
the sooner we are going to see 
those resources deployed and we will 
not yet miss another construction season 
in the North Country. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor and 
express great gratitude for the opportunity 
to speak. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Louisiana. 

Ms. LANDRIEU. I know the Senator 
from Tennessee is on the floor and I 
would like to take 2 or 3 minutes. I 
know we can go back and forth but I 
want to conclude a little bit of this debate 
we have had. 

First, I want to submit for the 
RECORD—because I am going to remain 
on the floor and speak after the Senator 
from Tennessee—but I want to put 
into the RECORD the list of Republican 
cosponsors of S. 2280, the date they became 
cosponsors, and the name of 
every single Member, including the 
Senator from Tennessee, who is a cosponsor 
of the Hoeven-Landrieu bill 
that is pending on the Senate Calendar, 

S. 2280. I ask unanimous consent that 
the list be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

Ms. LANDRIEU. I also want to put 
into the RECORD the 35-plus very powerful 
organizations that range from 
business to labor to manufacturers 
that have been a strong and powerful 
and vocal coalition for over 5 years in 
their efforts to bring us together. They 
have come together. The question is 
whether the Members of Congress will 
come together. These groups have 
come together. It is not often that you 
see the laborers, pipefitters, boilermakers, 
and builders and trades all together 
sitting down with the Chamber 
of Commerce and the American Petroleum 
Institute, but they managed to 
find common ground at a common 
table, and America will be best served 
when the Members of this body and the 
House do the same. 

I also want to put into the RECORD 
two short statements, and this is directed 
to those who are on the other 
side of this issue and who are wavering 
or are not sure. I want to put into the 
RECORD that the environmental review 
process has been conducted over 5 1/2 
years. The review process has been 
thorough. Five studies have been conducted, 
as required by law, and are 
complete. 

I want to repeat that. The five environmental 
studies that are required by 
law have been conducted. They are 
completed. I ask unanimous consent 
that material be printed in the 
RECORD.

BACKGROUND INFO 
Review Process: Five and a half years since 
it was first proposed in 2008, we are still reviewing 
it. The review process has been thorough. 
The five studies that have been conducted, 
as required by law, are complete. 

1. April 16, 2010—Department of State 
issues its Draft Environmental Impact 
Statement. It opens a 45-day comment period, 
which it extends for additional days. 
2. April 15, 2011—Department of State 
issues a Supplemental Draft Environmental 
Impact Statement and opens another 45-day 
comment period. More than 280,000 comments 
are received. 
3. August 26, 2011—Department of State 
issues its Final Environmental Impact 
Statement and opens up a 90-day review period. 
The agency continues accepting public 
comments. 
4. March 1, 2013—The U.S. State Department 
issued its Supplemental Environmental 
Impact Statement for the Keystone 
XL Presidential Permit application, which 
includes the proposed new route through Nebraska. 
The SEIS findings are similar to the 
Department’s FEIS issued last August, 
which found the pipeline will have limited 
adverse environmental impacts. 
5. January 31, 2014—The U.S. State Department 
issued its Final Supplemental Environmental 
Impact Statement for the permit application, 
confirming the project is safe and 
will have limited environmental impacts. 
The report reflects that TransCanada has 
agreed to incorporate 59 special safety conditions. 
Ms. LANDRIEU. In addition, the only 
other requirement is from the State 
Department, and I want to put this 
into the RECORD. But the bottom line is 
the last statement of the State Department 
finds ‘‘there will be no significant 
impact on the environment from the 
[Keystone XL] project.’’ I ask unanimous 
consent that it be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5895 

LATEST ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY FROM 

STATE DEPARTMENT 
The EIS finds that there will be no significant 
impact on the environment from the 
project. 
State Department finds that crude oil from 
the pipeline is unlikely to be exported, because 
the transport cost of getting it to the 

U.S. combined with transport overseas would 
be uneconomical. 
The study also finds that the failure to 
construct the pipeline will not negatively affect 
the rate at which oil is extracted from 
the oil sands—that is, State Department predicts 
that rail transport expansion will be 
able to support additional production. 

Ms. LANDRIEU. The path today is 
crystal clear. Today it is crystal clear. 
There is no guarantee that next week 
or next month or when the Republicans 
take the majority that the path could 
be as clear as it is today. Let us not 
miss this opportunity. Let us get our 
work done on the Keystone XL Pipeline, 
an important project in this country, 
and send a message that we have 
heard the voters and show that trust 
with us begins today on their behalf. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Tennessee. 

Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Presiding 
Officer and the Senator from 
Louisiana. 

f 

CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT 
BLOCK GRANT 

Mr. ALEXANDER. Tomorrow at 2:15 
we will have a vote on the Child Care 
and Development Block Grant of 2014. 

I want to take a few minutes and explain 
why it is important to end the debate 
on the Child Care and Development 
Block Grant and vote on whether 
we want to turn it into a law. 

When I talk about why it is important, 
I think of a young woman from 
Memphis who attended LeMoyne College. 
This woman had a young child 
and was able to qualify for a child care 
voucher from the State of Tennessee. 
There are about 900,000 families across 
the country that take advantage of 
this Federal voucher program. She was 
able to get $500 or $600 a month in order 
to provide daycare for her child while 
she pursued a business degree from 
LeMoyne-Owen College. With the help 
of this program she graduated with her 
degree and earned a position as an assistant 
manager at Walmart. With her 
new position, she is now able to pay for 
the child care for her second child 
without help from the Federal Government. 
This is exactly the kind of legislating 
we should be doing at the Federal 
level. 

What is the appropriate role of the 
Federal Government on an issue such 
as childcare? The answer this bill gives 
is that we should enable this young 
mother and 21,000 other families in 
Tennessee to take a Federal voucher, 
choose their own childcare center, and 
help them to financial independence 
through work or continued education 
or training programs. It has been an 
enormously successful program. The 

program has worked for over 20 years 
and was inaugurated in the administration 
of George H.W. Bush and was a bipartisan 
product of Congress. It follows 
the example of other successful Federal 
programs by enabling American families 
to help themselves. 

We follow the same model when we 
deal with Federal Pell grants and loans 
that help students pay for college. Last 
year the Presiding Officer will remember 
we had an agreement in this body 
on huge changes to the student loan 
program. President Obama became involved 
and Secretary Arne Duncan led 
a bipartisan working group to develop 
a solution. The Republican House of 
Representatives came along, and we 
created new rules for the $100 billion of 
loans the Federal Government makes 
to students every year. The result was 
a market-based system that is revenue-
neutral for the taxpayers, and lowered 
the interest rates on student loans to 
undergraduates by about one-half that 
year. We first used the idea of Federal 
vouchers for education with the passage 
of the GI bill in 1944. Recipients 
can take a voucher and then choose 
among educational institutions of their 
choice, such as the University of Notre 
Dame, University of New Mexico, University 
of Tennessee, Vanderbilt University, 
Yeshiva College, or whichever 
accredited college they so choose. This 
idea has worked very well and the GI 
bill may be the most successful piece of 
social legislation ever passed. 

The Child Care and Development 
Block Grant is a good example of the 
government working as an enabler 
rather than simply prescribing mandates. 
The program provides $5.3 billion 
for childcare services for children 
under the age of 13, with plenty of 
flexibility. While it has broad bipartisan 
support, Republican particularly 
appreciate the flexibility the act provides 
to States through block grants. 
States are then able to provide parents 
with vouchers so that they can select a 
provider that best meets their needs. It 
is a model that has proven successful 
since 1944 and one I hope we continue. 

Now we have the chance to move this 
bill forward by voting to end debate. 
The cloture vote that we will have tomorrow 
will reflect that we debated 
the bill fully and that at least 60 of us 
believe it is time to move forward and 
vote yes or no. 

Have we all had our say? I believe so. 
Senator HARKIN, Senator MIKULSKI, 
and Senator BURR, have worked on this 
for several years as well as several others 
of us. It was approved 1 year ago by 
the Senate Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions Committee on a bipartisan 
basis. Then in March of this year, 
2014, the bill was debated and discussed 
in this very chamber over a 2-day period. 


We have had a lot of discussion in the 
Senate about whether we get to offer 
amendments. That concern has come 
from the Senator who is presiding 
today, that concern has come from me, 
it has come from the Senator from 

Oklahoma, who is here. It is not easy 
to be elected to the Senate and it is not 
easy to stay in office. And once elected, 
senators want their voices to be heard, 
whether it is on the Keystone Pipeline 
or the Child Care and Development 
Block Grant. The Child Care and Development 
Block Grant went through a 
model process that began with the Senate 
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions 
Committee, then to the Senate 
floor on March 12 through unanimous 
consent. There was no motion for cloture, 
no filling of the tree, and anyone 
who offered a relevant amendment was 
able to share and debate that amendment. 


Senators offered 50 different amendments. 
Then we considered and agreed 
to 18 of those amendments. This body 
approved 4 by recorded vote and 14 by 
voice vote. Senators ENZI, LANDRIEU, 
FRANKEN, COBURN, BOXER, LEE, 
PORTMAN, TESTER, SCOTT, THUNE, BENNET, 
WARREN, VITTER, and SANDERS all 
had amendments to this bill. They 
were allowed to offer them, speak on 
them, and they were either voted on or 
accepted, and then the bill was passed 
by the Senate. 

The bill then went to the House of 
Representatives, was amended and approved 
and then sent back to us. Again, 
here we have an example of a good 
process. 

I think part of the reason for the 
quality of the process is the bipartisan 
appreciation for early childhood education. 
I think it is time to stop talking 
and vote on the Child Care and Development 
Block Grant. 

I ask our colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to vote for it. 

I think all of us can support the idea 
of early childhood education. I am the 
product of one of the first early learning 
programs in the State of Tennessee. 
When I was a child, my mother 
started one of the two early preschool 
education programs in our county. She 
held class in a converted garage in our 
back yard with 24 3-year-olds in the 
morning and 25 5-year-olds in the afternoon. 
It is hard to imagine a single 
mother dealing with that many children 
all at one time, but she did. As 
her son, I was able to experience kindergarten 
for 5 years. I may be the only 

U.S. Senator who can say that. 
I had an appreciation for early childhood 
education instilled in me by both 
my mother and father. Many of us in 
this chamber have a very similar appreciation. 
We may have different ways 
of trying to get to that goal, but this 
legislation, the Child Care and Development 
Block Grant, provides $5.3 billion 
to families across the country, 
namely mothers, who are going to 
school so they can get a job, or who are 
working so like the young woman in 
Memphis I mentioned earlier, can 
stand on their own two feet. This program 
helps them get started. 

It is an important bill. I congratulate 
Senators HARKIN and BURR and MIKULSKI 
for their hard work on this. I urge 
my colleagues tomorrow afternoon to

for the Child Care and Development 
Block Grant.

KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE 
Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I 
have been on the floor now for a couple 
of hours urging some of our colleagues 
to take heed of one of the clear messages 
from this election. People all 
over the country voted and spoke, and 
spoke clearly and loudly to say let’s 
get to work, let’s work together, let’s 
stop the gridlock and let’s find common 
ground to move our country forward. 
Two hours ago I came to the floor to 
see about one of the most important 
pieces of legislation, the Keystone 
Pipeline, as Chair of the Energy Committee 
in the Senate. I have had the 
great privilege of working in a bipartisan 
manner with the Members of the 
Republican Caucus on this bill led by 
Senator HOEVEN. I am the lead sponsor 
on the Democratic side and there is a 
large group of my colleagues trying to 
convince this body to have a vote, and 
a strong 60-vote margin, which is required 
for passage on the Keystone 
Pipeline. The Senator from West Virginia 
has come down and the Senator 
from North Dakota came down to 
speak and the Senator from Montana 
joined me, and I want to announce we 
have just gotten great word from the 
House of Representatives. Evidently 
they heard us speaking, and they have 
introduced our bill in the House. 
They have introduced our bill in the 
House, and the information we have 
gotten is that they plan to pass it tomorrow. 
Let me just say hallelujah. I 
will say it again—hallelujah—because 
their bill would never have passed this 
body and their bill would not have any 
chance of getting the President’s signature 
because it is Keystone Pipeline 
plus—or it was—but now the House has 
introduced the exact same bill as the 
Hoeven-Landrieu bill. We now have an 
even clearer path to victory. I started 
2 hours ago saying that I could see the 
path. I am not sure everybody else 
could, but it is clear to me now that 
everybody is starting to see it, and I 
could not be happier. 
I don’t have the actual number of the 
House bill. I was just told they introduced 
an identical bill, including the 
private property language, which is absolutely 
essential to secure the 60 votes 
required. That is why I drafted it in the 
bill, that is why Senator HOEVEN insisted 
it be in the bill, and that is why 
we have it in the bill. I thank the 
House for keeping that language, which 
is important for its ultimate passage. 
To me, it looks as though just in the 
last 2 hours lots of people are paying 
attention, and this is wonderful because 
this is an important step. 
I believe I am also a cosponsor of 
Senator ALEXANDER’s bill. No Senator 

has worked harder in either party, and 
that is saying a lot because Senator 
MURRAY and Senator MIKULSKI have 
worked hard on this issue. Senator 
ALEXANDER—a former Secretary of 
Education—has been ceaseless and tireless 
in his effort on behalf of early 
childhood education. He and I worked 
together when President Bush was 
President. I believe and I hope I am a 
cosponsor of his bill, and I look forward 
to helping him move that piece of legislation 
forward for a vote. There 
might be a few things in there other 
Members disagree with, but that is our 
process. This is a critical issue for education 
and job creation as well. We 
have the Keystone Pipeline on one end, 
which is as concrete as steel, and then 
we have the soft issues, which are also 
important issues, such as economic development, 
which begins with early 
childhood education. I am so proud to 
be an advocate of both bills, and I 
thank the Senator for his leadership. 

I urge my Members, who I believe 
have been very supportive on this 
issue—as have the Republican Members—
to give cloture on his bill. 

I yield the floor.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 
Mr. INHOFE. I read with a lot of interest 
about the trip President Obama 
made to China and his meeting with 
President Xi over what they characterized 
as an agreement on greenhouse gas 
emissions. I didn’t hear any kind of 
agreement or anything that was said 
by the President of China, and they 
have been talking about this as a historic 
breakthrough. That is exactly 
what they said in 2009, back when Copenhagen 
was center stage for the big 
annual party. 
Just so people are aware of what goes 
on, the United Nations throws a big 
party to get countries to agree to reduce 
greenhouse gases by a certain 
amount. It is kind of interesting since 
at one of the first ones I went to, I saw 
a good friend of mine from Benin in 
West Africa, and I said: You guys are 
not sucked into this thing—I know 
that for a fact—in terms of any kind of 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. 
What would happen to the economy of 
West Africa if you did that? 
He said: This is the biggest party of 
the year, so we are all going to be here. 
The same thing was true in Copenhagen. 
Before I go into that, let’s take a 
look at what they called a major historic 
breakthrough between the United 
States and China where the President 
pledged to reduce the emissions in the 
United States between 26 and 28 percent 
by 2025. What did China agree to? 
First of all, even if they did agree to 
reduce emissions, we would not believe 
them because they don’t end up doing 
what they say they are going to do in 
these agreements. But China says that 
what they are going to do is stop in


creasing their CO2 emissions by 2030. In 
other words, between now and 2030 they 
are going to continue to increase their 
levels of CO2 emissions, which I agree 
they are going to do that. 

Next year—that is, a year from December—
there is going to be another 
big party that will be in Paris, and it 
will be the one where President Obama 
says he and President Xi from China 
have an agreement. But, of course, that 
is going to be kind of like it was in Copenhagen 
back in 2009. 

I remember 2009 so well. At that time 
I was—and I still am—on the Environment 
and Public Works Committee. We 
had a wonderful lady who was President 
Obama’s appointee to be the Director 
of the EPA, and at that time in 
Copenhagen they already had Congresswoman 
PELOSI, Senator BOXER, President 
Obama, and then-Senator John 
Kerry. All of them were over there 
promising the 191 countries that were 
in Copenhagen that we were going to 
pass some kind of cap and trade. 

After that was over, I went on a 
quick roundtrip to Copenhagen. I always 
remember that trip because I was 
on the ground, after all that travel, all 
of 3 hours, but I think it was the most 
enjoyable 3 hours I ever had because I 
was able to be over there as a one-man 
truth squad and to say to the people attending 
that great meeting there that 
the United States was not going to pass 
any kind of cap and trade. In fact, the 
most votes they could have gotten in 
the Senate at that time—and the Senate 
is changing, as we all know—was 30 
votes. Obviously it took a lot more 
than that to do that. 

I went over as the one-man truth 
squad to tell them that they were not 
telling the truth and that there is no 
way in the world we are going to pass 
it, and the same is true this time. 

I will tell you what that meeting reminds 
me of. It reminds me of the 
meeting that took place in China a 
couple of days ago with our President. 
It reminded me of the meeting that 
took place in Rio de Janeiro. This 
would have been in 1998, which was during 
the Clinton White House. They 
went over there and agreed and signed 
the Kyoto Treaty. They signed the 
treaty knowing for a fact that it would 
not be ratified on this end. We know it 
takes a supermajority to ratify a treaty 
in the Senate. 

We had a resolution that was passed 
at that time called the Byrd-Hagel resolution. 
It said that we would not ratify 
any agreement, such as Kyoto or 
anything like that, that didn’t do two 
things—that were either harmful to 
the economy or didn’t treat all countries 
the same. In other words, we have 
to treat the reductions in China the 
same as they would be in the United 
States. Of course the Kyoto Treaty 
didn’t do that. They knew at the time 
it was not going to be ratified. In fact, 
they were not even going to submit it 
for ratification to this body, and that 
is exactly what did happen. 

Let’s look at what is happening in 
China right now. China is doing pretty 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5897 

well. Between 2005 and 2011, China 
added roughly two 600-megawatt coal-
fired powerplants per week. That is two 
powerplants a week. In 7 years, China 
added more coal capacity to its fleet 
than existed in the entire United 
States. This is not going to be slowing 
down in the years to come. By their 
own admission, they will be increasing 
between now and 2030. China is expected 
to bring a new coal-fired power-
plant online every 10 days to give its 
economy the electricity it demands. So 
China is now the largest consumer and 
importer of coal in the world. 

It is kind of interesting. We are going 
through the shale revolution in this 
country. Wonderful things are happening 
here. If we did not have the resistance 
from the White House, we 
could be totally independent from any 
other nation for the production of energy. 
China, on the other hand, doesn’t 
have the shale or the oil or the gas. 
They don’t have the coal, but they can 
import the coal, and that is exact what 
they are doing, and they will continue 
to do that. Stop and think. If you don’t 
like the arguments, just use logic. Why 
would China ever agree unilaterally to 
reduce its emissions when that is the 
only way it can produce electricity? 

I have talked to them before. I talk 
to people who smile and laugh at us 
and say: Wait a minute. You say you 
believe us when we say we are going to 
reduce our emissions? We applaud the 
United States. We want the United 
States to reduce its emissions. If they 
do that, the manufacturing base has to 
leave the United States and come to 
China. 

So it is to their advantage to increase 
their emissions, and that is exactly 
what will happen. 

We will talking about this a lot. I 
will chair the Environment and Public 
Works Committee. I chaired that several 
years ago when the Republicans 
were in the majority, and the Republicans 
are a majority again. We will 
look at these things logically, and we 
will conduct ourselves in a way that 
will not give the United States of 
America the largest single tax increase 
in history. 

Way back in the beginning, in 2001 
and that timeframe, a lot of us thought 
there was actually some truth to the 
global warming issue, and a lot of people 
are trying to resurrect that now. 
However, at that time people didn’t 
know what the cost was going to be. 
Shortly after that, it was the MIT, 
Charles River Associates, and the 
Wharton School that came out with an 
approximation of what it would cost in 
the way of a tax increase for the American 
people if we were to adopt the 
global warming provisions they wanted 
to adopt, which was between $300 and 
$400 billion a year. 

If you follow that statement with a 
statement not from me and not from 
anyone else on the floor of the Senate 
but from Lisa Jackson, who was the 
Director of the EPA and was appointed 
by President Obama—I asked her this 

question on the record: Let’s say that 
we go ahead and pass one of these resolutions. 


The resolutions have been offered 
since 2002. The first one was offered by 
MCCAIN and Lieberman and the last 
one by my friend Senator MARKEY, who 
was then in the House. 

I said: If we pass any of these—the 
largest increase in history—would this 
have the effect of reducing greenhouse 
gases? 

Her answer—Lisa Jackson, Director 
of the EPA, said: No, it would not. She 
said the problem is in China, India, and 
Mexico, and that would not affect the 
overall world emissions of CO2. 

So for those who really believe there 
is going to be something that comes 
before us in the form of a treaty—as 
our President has said will happen in 
Paris 13 months from now—keep in 
mind that it is something that will not 
happen, the same as it was not going to 
happen in Copenhagen. The American 
people are not ready. They have studied 
this issue. They know the science is 
not there, and what they want to do is 
to avoid any kind of a negative effect 
on our economy, and that is exactly 
what I think will happen. 

I see my good friend is here, and I 
yield the floor.

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in the 
days after the election this year, I 
heard a number of my colleagues— 
many from my State—in the House of 
Representatives and in the Senate talk 
with great exuberance about repealing 
the Affordable Care Act. They call it 
ObamaCare; others call it the Affordable 
Care Act. I am not sure where 
they were over the last month or so, 
but I remember hearing Pope Francis I 
exhort his parish priests to go out and 
smell like the flock. Abraham Lincoln 
used to talk about it. He would say he 
needs to go outside of the White House 
and get his public opinion baths. 
I cite Pope Francis and President 
Lincoln because I think if my colleagues 
had been out talking to real 
people and not going to fundraisers, 
not meeting with rich people at country 
clubs, and not going to the political 
rallies, but out talking to real people, 
they would have seen what the Affordable 
Care Act has done. 
In a moment, I wish to talk about a 
couple of numbers, but more importantly, 
I want to share some stories. 
More than 500,000 people in Ohio—and I 
think New Mexico, the Presiding Officer’s 
State, is proportionately no different—
have health insurance today 
who did not have it 14 months—did not 
have it 1 year ago. An additional 97,000 
young Ohioans—people who are just a 
bit older than the pages sitting here; 
18, 20, 25—are on their parents’ health 
plans. Thousands of Ohioans have been 

protected as patients, as people who 
are insured. When they would get sick 
and their coverage was expensive, they 
would be dropped by insurance companies 
because they were too costly. Now 
they have the consumer protections 
and they can’t be dropped from coverage. 
One million Ohio seniors now 
have gotten—with no copay and no deductible—
free preventive care for 
osteoporosis and physician screenings. 
One million Ohio seniors were able to 
get their screenings at no cost. 

I have to tell a quick story. Every 
Thursday anybody from Ohio can come 
to a coffee we have in our office at 8:30 

a.m. when the Senate is in session. A 
family came by on one of those Thursdays. 
They were pretty conservative. I 
assume they were not really voters for 
me, but it didn’t matter. We were talking 
about a bunch of different issues. 
The mother said: Thank you for the 
Affordable Care Act. See my son over 
there? He is 15 years old. 

I said: Yes. 

He was across the room. She said 
that when he was 7, he was diagnosed 
with diabetes. 

She said: I have counted, since he 
was diagnosed, 34 times that he was 
turned down for insurance. 

My family was turned down for insurance. 
Last week she told me I got insurance 
because of the Affordable Care 
Act, because we don’t allow under Federal 
law now that that be done. 

Let me share for a moment, if I 
could, a handful of letters I have received 
from people who have written 
me because of the Affordable Care Act. 

Rachel from Hamilton County writes 
that since 2008 she and her husband insured 
themselves through individual 
insurance. It had been difficult, and at 
times, we had to go without insurance 
because of the incredibly high cost. I 
had also been denied insurance due to a 
preexisting condition. All of that 
changed since we were able to sign up 
via the healthcare.gov site. But imagine 
my surprise when I heard the D.C. 
Circuit Court struck down subsidies 
people like myself receive. I receive a 
subsidy because health insurance has 
become so expensive that it is 
unaffordable for so many of us. I fear 
we will not be able to afford insurance 
if we lose our subsidy. 

Linda from Madison County, west of 
Columbus, writes: My husband and I 
have personally benefited from the portion 
of the bill that did away with lifetime 
maximum payments. I suspect it 
may have saved our retirement and 
kept us off welfare rolls. My colleague 
benefited from the portion of the bill 
that allowed her son, who suffers from 
a potentially fatal illness, to stay on 
her insurance through age 26, at which 
time he graduated with a master’s degree 
and got a job. 

So this is exactly what this was written 
for—a 23–24-year-old graduating 
from college, going on to get more 
school, getting a master’s degree, preparing 
himself or herself for something 
better in life. That young man could 


S5898 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE November 12, 2014 

stay on his parents’ health insurance 
plan until he got a job at 27, with insurance. 


Chandra in Summit County writes 
that she recently commented to some 
friends about the surprising benefits 
she was receiving under the Affordable 
Care Act, and one of her friends suggested 
she share her story with her 
elected officials. She says: Because of 
the ACA, we were able to switch to my 
husband’s insurance without worrying 
that I would not be covered due to my 
pregnancy being a preexisting medical 
condition. The ACA had a very real financial 
impact on my family. 

The question is, Why do some Members 
of this Congress, all of whom, I believe—
almost all of whom—are receiving 
government-sponsored health insurance 
benefits from a good government 
insurance plan—why do they 
want to deny it to people such as 
Chandra and people such as Rachel and 
others. 

Chandra says: I am not the type of 
individual who one would first think of 
when thinking of beneficiaries of the 
ACA. I have a master’s degree, my husband 
and I both work full-time, and our 
employers also offer a full range of 
medical, prenatal, and optical benefits. 

A few years ago, my husband and I 
decided to begin growing our family. 
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 
there were no copays for my prenatal 
care, suggested immunizations or potential 
well visits. When our son was 
born, I immediately saw the true impact 
of the Affordable Care Act. Babies 
have many well visits and the cost of 
copays and immunizations have been a 
burden to some of my friends. Thanks 
to the ACA, we didn’t have that financial 
burden. Thanks to a combination 
of good insurance and the Affordable 
Care Act, I was the recipient of a very 
nice, double electric breast pump. I 
also became the first employee at my 
job to utilize the provisions of the ACA 
for nursing mothers. A few years later, 
2 months before our second child was 
due, I had the opportunity to take a 
better job. 

She goes on. 

The question again is, Why do they 
want—why do a bunch of politicians 
who have good insurance, paid for by 
taxpayers—why do they want to take 
these benefits away from the 25-year-
old man who now has insurance on his 
parents’ plan before he finishes school 
and goes out in the workplace? Why do 
they want to take away the preventive 
care families now have so when their 
daughter has an earache they can actually 
go to a family doctor because of 
the insurance rather than go to the 
emergency room? All of those things 
just beg the question, Why the politics 
of repealing ObamaCare and repealing 
the Affordable Care Act and taking 
these benefits away from so many 
Americans? 

Five hundred thousand Ohioans have 
insurance, 100,000 more young people, a 
million Ohio seniors getting benefits 
with no copays and no deductibles, pre


ventive care that helps them live 
longer, healthier lives. That is really 
the question. 

I yield the floor.

U.S.-CHINA CLIMATE AGREEMENT 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I rise to 
commend the historic agreement 
reached yesterday between the United 
States and China, the world’s largest 
emitters of carbon pollution. This 
agreement is the latest and perhaps 
most consequential in a string of actions 
President Obama has taken to 
fight climate change. 
Today, we have hope. We have hope 
because this agreement puts the world 
on a path towards solving climate 
change—hope because the world’s two 
largest emitters have found common 
cause in protecting public health and 
economic opportunity for their citizens 
and for the world and hope because we 
are once again reminded what American 
leadership and political will can 
accomplish. 
President Obama and President Xi of 
China recognize that climate change 
threatens our families, our jobs, our 
health, and our way of life. They deserve 
our thanks, as does Secretary 
Kerry, for their tireless work and dedication 
to this cause. 
We can solve this. We know what we 
need to do, and we know how to do it. 
Today we see what political will can 
accomplish. I am now more hopeful 
than ever that we can keep warming 
below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of 
the century. This is the level scientists 
say is necessary to stay below in order 
to avoid catastrophic global consequences. 
Together our two countries account 
for about 40 percent of the world’s 
greenhouse gas emissions. We have a 
responsibility to act early and to act 
together, and this agreement puts us 
on that path. 
The agreement recognizes that the 
United States and China must take 
short- and long-term measures to reduce 
emissions and encourage the development 
of clean energy. This represents 
a major shift for China, which 
had struggled to balance economic 
growth with growing pollution and has 
now agreed to cap carbon pollution for 
the first time ever. It is difficult to 
overstate what an important achievement 
this is, especially a full year before 
the next round of international negotiations 
in Paris. 
As Secretary Kerry said today, this 
is a major signal to other countries 
that they should also put forth ambitious 
emissions reduction goals well 
before international negotiations start 
in 2015. 
In addition, China has agreed to get a 
full 20 percent of its energy from zero 
emission sources by 2030. This means 
China will have to deploy close to 1,000 
gigawatts of new zero emission power-
plants. This is the amount of elec


tricity the entire United States currently 
generates and shows just how 
serious China is about addressing this 
problem. 

American leadership was crucial in 
forging these goals. It wouldn’t have 
been possible without the President’s 
Clean Power Plan, which will reduce 
emissions from the power sector by 30 
percent relative to 2005 levels by the 
year 2030. 

This agreement goes beyond even 
those ambitious targets, and in the 
coming months and years, it will be 
important for this President and the 
next to maintain and strengthen the 
Environmental Protection Agency’s 
ability to protect Americans from 
harmful pollution. 

Despite near universal consensus 
among climate scientists that the 
Clean Power Plan is part of the solution 
to fighting climate change, today 
that plan is under attack in Congress. 
Right after the President announced 
this historic agreement, climate 
deniers in Congress started rolling out 
every tired argument in the book. In 
fact, one of our colleagues here has already 
dubbed this plan ‘‘unrealistic’’ 
and called it an ‘‘ideological war.’’ 

These claims are the last bastion of a 
hopeless cause that ignores what we 
see all around us—from farmers to fishermen 
to small-town mayors. Theirs is 
an untenable position, because poll 
after poll shows that Americans do 
care about this issue. They care about 
it deeply. Americans care because they 
know fighting climate change is really 
about protecting their children’s 
health, protecting economic opportunity, 
and leaving our children a 
world better than our own. 

We are seeing the deniers’ arguments 
collapse around them. One of their favorite 
tropes was to claim that U.S. actions 
are meaningless without action 
from China. Well, it looks as though 
that argument took a fairly big hit 
yesterday. 

In fact, the U.S. did act first by developing 
the Clean Power Plan. The 
rules haven’t even been finalized, but 
they are already giving us the leverage 
to reach major international agreements. 


As excuse after excuse fails, we will 
see climate deniers retreat to tired 
claims that anything we do to reduce 
pollution will hurt the economy. But 
remember that we have heard these 
claims before. They were wrong then, 
and they are wrong now. 

The list is long, so I will mention 
just a few. Taking the lead out of gasoline, 
putting catalytic converters in 
cars, reducing acid rain, all were met 
with panicky claims of economic devastation. 
But what we have learned is 
that keeping our air and our water 
clean actually helps our economy. 

This agreement between the United 
States and China is historic. It is a real 
breakthrough, and it gives us hope that 
we will be able to confront and resolve 
one of the greatest challenges of our 
time. But it is still just an agreement. 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5899 

We need to follow through with action. 
We must listen to the American people 
and amplify their voices as they call 
for action to preserve our health, our 
economy, and our way of life. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
BROWN). The Senator from Louisiana. 

f 

KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE 
Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I was 
on the floor earlier today. I have been 
on the floor since we convened back 
into session—our first session since the 
election—and I am very heartened by 
what I have heard from colleagues such 
as the Senator from Hawaii, who just 
spoke, our colleague from Montana, 
who just spoke, our colleague from 
Tennessee, who spoke; as well as the 
leadership particularly, including 
Leader REID, majority leader-to-be 
MITCH MCCONNELL, and the Senator 
from Texas, Mr. CORNYN, all of whom 
came to the floor and said they heard 
the message of the American people. 
The message is that now is the time to 
stop the bickering, stop the fighting, 
stop the gridlock, and take action on 
issues the American people know are 
the right answers for our country, focusing 
on building jobs and economic 
hope for the middle class, in large 
measure because of this extraordinary 
opportunity for an energy renaissance 
that is underway as we speak—energy 

jobs, petrochemical jobs, manufacturing 
jobs. 
Our unemployment rate in south 

Louisiana is 3.5 percent. Our general 
unemployment rate is much lower than 
the national average and has been for 
many years. But even in my State, 
with these very positive numbers, mid-
dle-class families are seeing their incomes 
stagnate, their way of life not 
progressing, and their economic 
progress not moving forward as it 
should. 

So while people are happy and doing 
well in some parts of the country— 
every leader came to the floor and said, 
we heard the American people. We 
want jobs. We want economic opportunity. 
We want the middle class put 
first. We want gridlock put last, and we 
want you all to roll up your sleeves and 
get the job done. That was the message. 


So I came to the floor at 2 o’clock, 
the first minute we opened, to claim 
the floor to say let’s begin with trusting 
each other, moving forward, and 
passing the Keystone Pipeline which is 
a bill that has enjoyed bipartisan support 
and has the 60 votes on this floor 
for passage. 

There is strong objection from the 40 
Members who have been opposed. Of 
course they have a right to be opposed. 
We debated this for 5 years, but the 
process is let’s vote and let the process 
move forward. I am very encouraged 
that in the 2 hours 15 minutes I have 
been on the floor that the House of 
Representatives has actually heard 
this call and has decided to introduce— 

the Rules Committee will be meeting 
tonight. I understand they want to introduce 
the identical bill to the 
Hoeven-Landrieu bill which will give a 
clear path. It is a stand-alone Keystone 
only with private property rights language 
that is very important to the Republican 
base but it is also very important 
to Democratic Members, for me, 
personally, and my State, but for many 
rural States on the Democratic side. 
We cannot allow international companies 
to expropriate our properties here 
without due process. It cannot happen. 
I am the strongest advocate of building 
pipelines everywhere, but there are private 
property rights that have to be 
followed. 

The language carefully drafted by 
Senator HOEVEN and myself respects 
the private property rights of American 
citizens. I understand the House is 
going to take that language and the 
straight-up, no attachments, no riders, 
no anything—except for the Keystone 
language as it is written in this file 
that is pending and pass that out of the 
House. 

We have already made some progress 
in getting the Keystone project built or 
moving forward. I want to put into the 
record a couple of headlines of magazines 
and articles that I think help to 
underline or underscore what I am trying 
to say. 

The ‘‘Science’’ magazine editor-in-
chief says, ‘‘Time to move forward on 
Keystone Pipeline.’’ 

LABI: ‘‘Twenty Louisiana Chambers 
of Commerce support Keystone Pipeline.’’ 
This is the Louisiana Association 
of Business Industry. It is a recent 
headline. 

The Washington Post: ‘‘On the Keystone 
XL pipeline, put policy ahead of 
politics.’’ That is what we are doing 
today. 

Illinois Review—this is one of the 
most important. ‘‘AFL–CIO says Keystone 
XL is not just a pipeline but a 
life line.’’ 

The largest labor unions in our country 
have rolled up their sleeves. They 
are in this fight. They are telling us, 
Democrats and Republicans, but mostly 
to the Democratic Caucus, because 
they are part of our base, vote for the 
pipeline. This is jobs for average mid-
dle-class working people that we need. 
We deserve them, they say, in States 
such as yours, Mr. President, Ohio, Illinois, 
Pennsylvania, and in States such 
as Colorado, New Mexico, New York. I 
could go on and on. In West Virginia. 

Remember, my State—not that we 
don’t need good jobs but our unemployment 
rate is very low. We have jobs 
and opportunities pouring into Louisiana 
and Texas, the energy coast of 
America. We are proud of it. 

We are proud not only to produce 
these jobs and this energy but we are 
helping to fuel a renaissance of manufacturing 
in the Midwest. We are exceedingly 
proud of this. We are not just 
creating jobs for ourselves, we are creating 
jobs for the Midwest, for the 
manufacturing renaissance of America. 

We are allowing for the expansion of 
the economy on the east coast and providing 
help for the west coast. It is 
what we do. It is what America’s energy 
coast does. No coast does it better 
than we do. 

We are connecting to a partner, Canada, 
which is better for us in many 
ways than Venezuela or even some of 
our friends in the Mideast, and we 
don’t—not every friend is our friend in 
the Mideast. We are getting oil from 
our best friend, our best trading partner, 
our best ally, that has equal economic 
standards as we do and even 
some higher environmental standards 
than we do to create economic opportunity 
for our country. 

I wanted to submit this for the 
record. There are no other Senators to 
speak. I am going to yield the floor in 
a minute. 

We are still in a time of morning 
business until votes at 5:30. 

I suggest the absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 

Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be able to 
show a device in the course of my presentation 
about exploding airbags. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

f 

AIRBAGS 
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, there 
has been quite a bit in the press about 
defective exploding airbags. This is a 
part of a steering wheel with the airbag 
deployed. In the steering wheel, the 
driver would be like this with their 
hands on the steering wheel. When the 
impact occurs and the airbag is deployed, 
instantly, if you have seen that 
kind of impact on the airbag, because 
of the chemicals inside of the steering 
wheel, it causes an explosion that 
comes out of already existing holes in 
the metal that contains the airbag and 
it deploys the airbag like this so that 
the—in this case, the driver—in the 
case of the passenger, the same, but it 
is not a steering wheel like this. That 
protects and has saved countless, thousands 
and thousands of lives. The fact 
is that we now know there are four 
people in this country who are dead. 
There are a hundred who are injured. 
That is not including the international 
office, because of the defective airbag 
that has been manufactured by a Japanese 
manufacturer. What its defect is 
is that instead of the chemicals exploding 
to inflate the airbag, it explodes 
with such force for all of this that is 
contained within the steering wheel before 
it explodes. There is metal. 
When the chemical explosion occurs, 
it is supposed to go through the air-
holes and fill the bag. Instead, what 


S5900 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE November 12, 2014 

has happened in the explosion, it is 
with such force that some of the metal 
becomes shrapnel and comes through 
the bag and in effect becomes lethal 
projectiles that harm either the driver 
or the passenger. 

For example, on this exploded airbag, 
I want you to see the size of the hole 
that was ripped in this bag here. Here 
is another one. A hole that was ripped. 
There are holes in other parts of the 
bag. Obviously this isn’t supposed to 
occur. 

As a matter of fact, I visited with a 
constituent from central Florida. This 
is a firefighter with a young wife and a 
young child. A piece of shrapnel, in 
this particular constituent’s case, 
came into his eye. 

Therefore, in his occupation as a firefighter, 
he will not be able to fulfill the 
financial support for his family as a 
firefighter. Four people in this country 
are confirmed dead, and 100 are injured. 

We have a Federal agency that is 
supposed to be protecting us. It is 
called the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration. 

Recently, because of the attention 
brought to this matter, they have come 
out and said they want these recalls, 
but the recalls first started out at 
about 4.7 million. It has been doubled 
to 7.8 million. It is increasing all the 
time, and it is expected that it will be 
in the range of 11 million in this country 
and 16 million recalls worldwide. 

Normally, if you could get the recalls 
done, once it occurs—once the defect is 
known—then the public is protected. 

But it seems like, similarly to some 
dragging of the feet of automobile 
manufacturers and their parts manufacturers 
in the past, that is what is 
occurring here. What we are also seeing 
is a Federal agency that in this Senator’s 
opinion has not been right up 
front, forward leaning, and aggressive 
to protect the public. 

Thus, I have requested of the Secretary 
of the Department of Transportation 
to get in this and to do several 
things: First, to make sure that all 
these recalls are happening, and, secondly, 
if you are a person who knows of 
the recall because the automobile manufacturer 
has sent you a letter, are you 
going to be wanting to drive around if 
they tell you they can’t fix it immediately? 
Are you going to be wanting 
to drive around in an automobile that 
could suddenly explode and cover you 
with metal shrapnel, severely injuring 
or killing you? Of course not. 

So where is the automobile manufacturer 
with regard to giving a loaner 
until that air bag can be replaced with 
a safe one or where are they with regard 
to providing a rental car? 

For the automobile company to say 
we will disable the airbag until we can 
get the proper replacement, that is not 
a solution because often the seatbelt 
and the airbag are designed to work in 
conjunction with each other to protect 
the safety of the driver and the passenger. 
So driving around in a disabled 
airbag is not a solution. The solution is 

prompt replacement of the defective, 
lethal airbags or, until they can be replaced, 
to give the customer another 
automobile that is safe. 

Along the way, someone came up 
with the brilliant idea in the Federal 
agency that they were going to issue 
just regional recalls under the assumption 
that highway humidity, in fact, is 
one of the causes. They don’t know 
that, but that is one of the suspicious 
causes. But what does a regional recall 
do for the protection of the public? 
Aren’t we a mobile society? If you say 
we have high humidity in my State of 
Florida, in Texas and in other Southern 
States, aren’t we a mobile society 
in which people in other parts of the 
country who own automobiles come to 
our States? Of course we are. 

Oh, by the way, how about some 
States in the north that have high humidity 
in the summer—if, in fact, that 
is the cause. So to say that a solution 
to the problem is a regional recall is 
totally ridiculous and the Federal regulatory 
agency should not be issuing 
these kinds of edicts if we are serious 
about protecting the public. 

I have recommended, in a letter that 
has been signed by several of our colleagues 
to the Secretary of Transportation, 
Secretary Foxx, that he start 
imposing the maximum fine allowed by 
law per day against the automobile 
manufacturers for any days that are 
missed in replacing the defective airbags 
so that people will not have to 
drive around in cars with this defect. 

While we were home over this recess 
during the election, I had an airbag explode 
and demonstrate its force. It is 
severe, and it is quick, as it has to be 
in order to protect the passenger in an 
automobile accident. 

But if that airbag is defectively constructed 
so that the explosive force becomes 
like a hand grenade exploding 
and sending pieces of a metal into the 
human body which the very device is 
supposed to protect, then it is time for 
action. I hope the folks who are manufacturing 
and installing these defective 
airbags indeed are hearing these words 
of warning. 

I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 

Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

f 

TAXPAYERS RIGHT TO KNOW ACT 
Mr. COBURN. I wish to spend a few 
minutes talking about a bill that 
passed the House that has 37 bipartisan 
cosponsors in the Senate that came out 
of my committee. It is an important 
transparency item for the American 
taxpayers called the Taxpayers Right 
to Know Act. 
What most Americans don’t realize is 
there is only one agency that knows 

how many programs it has—only one. 
None of the rest of the Federal agencies 
know how many Federal programs 
they are running. They can’t put them 
down, can’t list them on a piece of 
paper. 

The GAO has recommended for a long 
period of time—starting about 3 or 4 
years ago—that we should be putting 
this down when we have the truth in 
transparency and the truth in accountability 
act and the transparency act 
with President Obama. We started this 
process where the GAO would look for 
duplication and report it to Congress. 

We have a bill that has passed unanimously 
in the House. It is a bipartisan 
bill that came with a voice vote out of 
our committee. All it says is that 
every agency ought to have to list 
their programs every year so we can 
know what they are doing. GAO says 
that will help immensely in terms of 
eliminating this $200 billion to $300 billion 
a year in duplication. 

We are going to have some unanimous 
requests later today, and we will 
have a bill that is on the floor for 
which the majority leader has once 
again filled the tree, which allows no 
amendments whatsoever on the bill. 

This bill should be on the floor, 
should be standing on its own, and 
should be passed because nobody can 
honestly object to the agencies not 
knowing what programs they run, not 
having a complete list. 

I mean, it is counterintuitive that 
anybody would vote against it. It 
makes no sense that we don’t know 
that, and we know we need to have it. 
It is an easy vote for everybody, and 
the majority leader isn’t going to allow 
an amendment. 

So we are not at a new day yet with 
this present majority leader. This is 
something that helps every American— 
Democrat or Republican. It helps us 
run our government more efficiently, 
more effectively. It is a good-government 
amendment, and yet it is not 
going to be allowed. 

I am disheartened that at the end of 
the year we could actually do some 
things together that would actually 
allow us to accomplish real things for 
the American people that will make a 
real difference in the long run, but we 
won’t because we don’t want to have 
what was guaranteed to the minority 
when the Senate was set up—the right 
to offer amendments. 

I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll.

roll.

November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5901 

LEIGH MAY, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE 
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, one of 
the great honors of being a Member of 
the Senate is the participation and the 
confirmation process the Constitution 
dictates to us on Federal judges and 
other critical appointees, such as Cabinet 
members of the President. 
I have today a distinct honor and 
privilege to recommend to all of my 
colleagues in the Senate a Georgia lawyer 
who has been nominated by the 
President of the United States, with 
the approval of Senator CHAMBLISS and 
myself, to the Northern District Court 
of Georgia. Her name is Leigh May. 
She is an unbelievably exciting, unbelievably 
knowledgeable, unbelievably 
accomplished individual. 
She graduated from the Georgia Institute 
of Technology, one of the top 
three engineering schools in the United 
States of America, with honors, in 1993. 
Then, in 1998, she graduated from the 
University of Georgia Law School with 
a juris doctorate degree, magna cum 
laude in her class. 
From 1998 to 2000, she served as a law 
clerk to Judge Dudley H. Bowen, Jr., of 
the U.S. District Court for the Southern 
District of Georgia. She is a partner 
in the Atlanta office of Butler, 
Wooten & Fryhofer, LLP, one of the 
leading law firms in our State. Her 
practice focuses on complex civil litigation 
in both the State and Federal 
courts, and she is currently vice chair 
of the litigation section of the Atlanta 
Bar Association. Her ABA rating is 
unanimously very ‘‘qualified.’’ 
She is a very talented, very deserving 
person. I thank the President for his 
nomination. I thank Kathy Ruemmler, 
who was his leading advisor at the 
time, for her cooperation in this nomination. 
I close my recommendation to my 
colleagues by telling them this: Please 
vote for the cloture motion today so we 
can vote for confirmation tomorrow. 
This May, I was asked to address the 
University of Georgia’s graduation 
ceremony in Athens, GA. After the 
speech I made, I went back to the 
dressing room in the green room, and 
the dean of the law school came up to 
me and said: I just want you to know, 
Mr. ISAKSON, you nominated one of the 
smartest people to ever graduate from 
the law school of the University of 
Georgia when you nominated Leigh 
May. 
I can’t think of a higher or a better 
recommendation, and I commend Leigh 
May to my colleagues of the Senate 
with my highest recommendation in 
the hopes that folks will vote today to 
go to cloture and vote for the confirmation 
tomorrow to confirm Leigh 
May to the Northern District of Georgia. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will resume 
executive session. 
Under the previous order, there will 
be 2 minutes of debate equally divided 
prior to a vote on the motion to invoke 
cloture on the Moss nomination. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we return 
from recess for the remaining 
days of the 113th Congress, I begin by 
congratulating my friend Senator 
CHUCK GRASSLEY who will become 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee 
beginning in the 114th Congress. We 
have a very good working relationship, 
and I hope this will continue when he 
assumes the chairmanship in January. 
We still have several weeks left in 
this Congress with much work left to 
be done. As history shows, when both 
sides work together, the lameduck session 
can be a productive one for filling 
vacancies on our courts. In 2002, after 
the midterm elections, Senate Democrats 
worked to confirm 20 of President 
Bush’s judicial nominees—all but one 
by voice vote. In the 2006 lameduck session, 
after Senate Democrats won the 
majority in the elections, Democrats 
agreed to confirm the 14 judicial nominations 
pending on the floor, but this 
package was blocked by a Republican 
Senator. In the most recent lameduck 
sessions, in 2010 and 2012, a total of 32 
judicial nominees were confirmed. 
With the 2014 midterm elections behind 
us, I hope we will, as the incoming majority 
leader suggests, ‘‘clear the 
decks’’ on pending business so that we 
can start fresh next year. 
Currently, there are 16 district court 
nominations that have been pending 
before the full Senate for months and 
another eight district court nominations 
and one Court of International 
Trade nomination that will be reported 
out of the Judiciary Committee before 
the end of the month. There are also 
six nominees pending before the Senate 
to fill vacancies on the U.S. Court of 
Federal Claims, two nominees to fill 
vacancies on the Superior Court of the 
District of Columbia, and three nominees 
to fill vacancies on the U.S. Tax 
Court. 
Today, we will vote to overcome the 
needless filibuster of just two of the 
district court nominations that have 
been pending before the full Senate 
since June, one of which will fill a judicial 
emergency vacancy in Georgia. 
Randolph Moss is nominated to serve 
on the U.S. District Court for the Dis


trict of Columbia. The ABA Standing 
Committee on the Federal Judiciary 
unanimously rated Mr. Moss ‘‘well 
qualified’’ to serve on that court—its 
highest rating. Since 2001, he has been 
a partner at the law firm of Wilmer, 
Cutler, Pickering, Hale and Dorr LLP. 
He has also served in various capacities 
for the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Upon graduating from Yale Law 
School, Mr. Moss clerked for Judge 
Pierre N. Leval on the U.S. District 
Court for the Southern District of New 
York and for Justice John Paul Stevens 
on the U.S. Supreme Court. 

Leigh May is nominated to serve on 
the U.S. District Court for the Northern 
District of Georgia. She is currently 
a partner at the law firm of Butler, 
Wooten & Fryhofer, LLP, in Atlanta, 
GA, where she has practiced 
since 2000. After graduating magna 
cum laude from the University of Georgia 
Law School, she served as a law 
clerk to the Honorable Judge Dudley 

H. Bowen, Jr., of the U.S. District 
Court for the Southern District of 
Georgia. 
We still have much work to do to fill 
the 64 current judicial vacancies and 27 
known upcoming vacancies on our Federal 
district and circuit courts. Before 
the end of this Congress we could cut 
the number of vacancies on our district 
and circuit courts by one-third. To get 
this done, however, we must stop delaying 
for delay’s sake votes for consensus 
nominees. Unless there is cooperation 
from Republican Senators, 
we will not have time to clear the Executive 
Calendar before adjournment. 
At the very least, I would hope that the 
Republican Senators who recommended 
many of the pending judicial 
nominees to the President will 
work within their caucus to get consent 
to confirm their nominees. 

I hope all Senators will vote to put 
an end to the filibuster of these nominations. 


Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The assistant legislative clerk proceeded 
to call the roll. 

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—S. 2280 

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that following the 
leader’s remarks on Tuesday, November 
18, the Senate proceed to consideration 
of Calendar No. 371, S. 2280, a bill 
to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline; 
that there be up to 6 hours of debate 
equally divided between opponents and 
proponents; that upon the use or yielding 
back of time, the bill be read a 
third time and the Senate proceed to 
vote on passage of S. 2280; that no 
amendments, motions, or points of 
order be in order to the bill prior to the 
vote on passage; that the vote on passage 
be subject to a 60 affirmative-vote 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5903 

threshold. And I will include something. 
I ask that unanimous consent as 
in legislative session. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 

objection? 

The Senator from Texas. 

Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to 
object. 

Mr. President, we have been trying to 
get the Keystone Pipeline approved and 
on the President’s desk since 2012. The 
leader on our side has been the Senator 
from North Dakota, Senator HOEVEN. 
We have all supported this effort because 
we believe the State Department 
estimate that roughly 42,000 jobs would 
be created once the pipeline is approved. 
If the oil doesn’t come to the 
United States and is not turned into 
fuel here, it will be shipped to China. 

Unfortunately, the majority has 
blocked this pipeline several times. It 
has been stalled for way too long, so I 
am glad to see some progress is being 
made, albeit at this late date, after a 
dramatic election on November 4. 

I ask the Senator to modify her request 
so that if the Senate passes S. 
2280 and receives a bill from the House 
that is identical to S. 2280, then the 
House bill will be read three times and 
passed with no intervening action or 
debate, and thus we can send this bill 
directly to the President without further 
action. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator wish to modify the request? 

Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right 
to object. 

I thank the Senator from Texas engaging 
on this matter today. I appreciate 
it. Most importantly, I appreciate 
the comments he made earlier on the 
floor about rolling up our sleeves and 
getting to work. He was one of the first 
speakers this morning when our Senate 
convened, and I was here when he 
spoke. I wish to thank him for his very 
insightful and courageous words that 
said we should roll up our sleeves and 
get to work. 

He knows very well that I, and about 
12 to 15 Members on our side, have been 
working very hard with him and his 
leadership and all the Members of the 
Republican side to move the Keystone 
Pipeline bill forward. 

I think the Senator also knows the 
bill that Senator HOEVEN and I drafted 
respects this process, wanted to see the 
process complete, and acknowledges 
that the process is now complete and it 
is time to move. 

So because the House heard these 
words today and has decided to introduce 
the identical language in the 
Hoeven-Landrieu bill—and I think the 
Senator will agree with me it is good 
news—it looks to me as if they are prepared 
to pass it. I can see no reason to 
object to what the Senator from Texas 
is asking for, and I consider it extraordinary 
progress. 

I am very happy that I came to the 
floor at 2:00 p.m. to get the ball rolling 
and that I was here in time to hear the 
Senator’s remarks: Let’s get to work. 

So let’s get it done. We can get it 
done in the lameduck session, and I 
will accept the Senator’s counter. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request 
has been modified. 

Is there an objection to the modified 
request? 

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, a point 
of clarification. It is my understanding 
the Senator from Louisiana is not objecting 
to my amended request and has 
not posed another modification. I believe 
the question is, is there an objection 
to my modified request? 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Louisiana. 

Ms. LANDRIEU. I will clarify. I want 
the record to reflect my remarks. The 
Senator from Louisiana has absolutely 
no objection to the House of Representatives 
taking the exact language from 
my bill with Senator HOEVEN and passing 
it. Why would I object? I have been 
working on this for 4 years. Why would 
I object to that? The record should reflect 
that. The Senator from Louisiana 
has no objection whatsoever—and I am 
encouraged that the House is taking 
the exact language of the bill that I 
carefully drafted with Senator HOEVEN. 
He is the lead on this bill. I am not. It 
is his bill. He is the lead. I am just the 
Chair of the energy committee. 

I wish to thank Senator TESTER and 
others who helped to craft a bill that 
the House would accept, and so I have 
no objection to that. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modified request? 

Without objection, it is so ordered.

REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY 
WITH RESPECT TO IRAN THAT 
WAS DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE 
ORDER 12170 ON NOVEMBER 14, 
1979—PM 54 

The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before 
the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Committee 
on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs: 

To the Congress of the United States: 

Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), provides 
for the automatic termination of a national 
emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect beyond 
the anniversary date. In accordance 
with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the national 
emergency with respect to Iran 
that was declared in Executive Order 
12170 of November 14, 1979, is to continue 
in effect beyond November 14, 
2014. 

Because our relations with Iran have 
not yet returned to normal, and the 
process of implementing the agreements 
with Iran, dated January 19, 
1981, is still under way, I have determined 
that it is necessary to continue 
the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 12170 with respect to 
Iran.

definition of ‘‘widow’’ and ‘‘widower’’, 
and for other purposes; to the Committee 
on the Judiciary. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the 
past few years we have seen remarkable 
progress in one of the defining 
civil rights issues of our era—ensuring 
that all lawfully married couples are 
treated equally under the law. In 2011, 
when I chaired the first Congressional 
hearing to repeal the Defense of Marriage 
Act, only five states, including 
Vermont, recognized same-sex marriage. 
Following the Supreme Court’s 
historic decision last month to not review 
decisions from several circuits 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5921 

striking down same-sex marriage bans 
as unconstitutional, same-sex couples 
in 35 States and the District of Columbia 
are, or will soon be, able to marry. 
This is welcome progress. In modern 
America, no person should face discrimination 
based on the one they love. 

Despite this’ tremendous progress, 
there is still more to be done. As I said 
when the Supreme Court struck down 
Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage 
Act, ‘‘All couples who are lawfully 
married under state law, including in 
Vermont, should be entitled to the 
same Federal protections afforded to 
all other married couples.’’ Court challenges 
will continue in the remaining 
states that do not recognize marriage 
equality. In Congress, there are several 
steps we can take immediately to help 
ensure our federal laws treat all marriages 
equally. 

Surprisingly, the Copyright Act, 
which protects our Nation’s diverse 
creative voices, still bears vestiges of 
discrimination. A provision in the Act 
grants rights to surviving spouses of 
copyright owners only if the marriage 
is recognized in the owner’s state of 
residence at the time he or she dies. 
This means that a writer who lawfully 
marries his or her partner in Vermont 
or California is not a ‘‘spouse’’ under 
the Copyright Act if they move to 
Florida, Georgia, or one of the other 
states that do not currently recognize 
their marriage. 

Congress should close this discriminatory 
loophole to ensure our federal 
statutes live up to our Nation’s promise 
of equality under the law. It is 
wrong for the federal government to 
deny benefits or privileges to couples 
who have lawfully wed. 

Today I am introducing the Copyright 
and Marriage Equality Act in the 
Senate to correct this problem. The 
bill, a version of which was introduced 
in the House of Representatives by 
Representatives DEREK KILMER, ILEANA 
ROS-LEHTINEN, and JARED POLIS, 
amends the Copyright Act to look simply 
at whether a couple is lawfully 
married—not where a married couple 
happens to live when the copyright 
owner dies. It will ensure that the 
rights attached to the works of our Nation’s 
gay and lesbian authors, musicians, 
painters, photographers, and 
other creators pass to their widows and 
widowers. Artists are the creative lifeblood 
of our Nation, and our laws 
should protect their families equally. 

Statutes like the Copyright Act, or 
laws governing the Social Security Administration 
and Department of Veterans 
Affairs which also contain remnants 
of discrimination, are no place 
for inequality in our country. It is time 
to fix these outdated laws once and for 
all. I urge the Senate to pass this important 
piece of legislation. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the text of the bill be printed 
in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 

S. 2919 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the United States of America 
in Congress assembled, 

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Copyright 
and Marriage Equality Act’’. 

SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF WIDOW AND WIDOWER IN 
TITLE 17, UNITED STATES CODE. 

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 101 of title 17, 
United States Code, is amended by striking 
the definition of ‘‘‘widow’ or ‘widower’’’ and 
inserting the following: 
‘‘An individual is the ‘widow’ or ‘widower’ 
of an author if the courts of the State in 
which the individual and the author were 
married (or, if the individual and the author 
were not married in any State but were validly 
married in another jurisdiction, the 
courts of any State) would find that the individual 
and the author were validly married 
at the time of the author’s death, whether or 
not the spouse has later remarried.’’. 

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment 
made by subsection (a) shall apply with respect 
to the death of any author that occurs 
on or after the date of the enactment of this 
Act.

TITLE XXXVI—VESSEL INCIDENTAL 
DISCHARGE 
SEC. 3601. SHORT TITLE. 

This title may be cited as the ‘‘Vessel Incidental 
Discharge Act’’. 

SEC. 3602. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following 
findings: 
(1) Beginning with enactment of the Act to 
Prevent Pollution from Ships in 1980 (22 
U.S.C. 1901 et seq.), the United States Coast 
Guard has been the principal Federal authority 
charged with administering, enforcing, 
and prescribing regulations relating to the 
discharge of pollutants from vessels engaged 
in maritime commerce and transportation. 
(2) The Coast Guard estimates there are 
approximately 21,560,000 State-registered 
recreational vessels, 75,000 commercial fishing 
vessels, and 33,000 freight and tank 
barges operating in United States waters. 
(3) From 1973 to 2005, certain discharges incidental 
to the normal operation of a vessel 
were exempted by regulation from otherwise 
applicable permitting requirements. 
(4) Over the 32 years during which this regulatory 
exemption was in effect, Congress 
enacted statutes on a number of occasions 
dealing with the regulation of discharges incidental 
to the normal operation of a vessel, 
including— 
(A) the Act to Prevent Pollution from 
Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) in 1980; 
(B) the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance 
Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 
4701 et seq.); 
(C) the National Invasive Species Act of 
1996 (110 Stat. 4073); 
(D) section 415 of the Coast Guard Authorization 
Act of 1998 (112 Stat. 3434) and section 
623 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation 
Act of 2004 (33 U.S.C. 1901 note), 
which established interim and permanent requirements, 
respectively, for the regulation 
of vessel discharges of certain bulk cargo 
residue; 
(E) title XIV of division B of Appendix D of 
the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 
(114 Stat. 2763), which prohibited or limited 
certain vessel discharges in certain areas of 
Alaska; 
(F) section 204 of the Maritime Transportation 
Security Act of 2002 (33 U.S.C. 1902a), 
which established requirements for the regulation 
of vessel discharges of agricultural 
cargo residue material in the form of hold 
washings; and 
(G) title X of the Coast Guard Authorization 
Act of 2010 (33 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.), which 
provided for the implementation of the 
International Convention on the Control of 
Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, 
2001. 
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this title is 
to provide for the establishment of nationally 
uniform and environmentally sound 
standards and requirements for the management 
of discharges incidental to the normal 
operation of a vessel.

marked a pivotal moment in the history of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, when Marian 
Deleon Guerrero Tudela was sworn in not only 
as the first female mayor of Saipan, but the 
first female mayor of any of our municipalities. 
Mayor Tudela assumed this position by operation 
of law upon the untimely death of Mayor 
Donald Glenn Flores. Though residing at the 
time in the mainland United States, she honorably 
agreed to serve her community through 
the remainder of his term, and returned to 
Saipan. 

With over 21 years in the private sector and 
over 10 years in government service, Mayor 
Tudela has a long and rich professional history. 
And this is not her first time to answer to 
the people directly. From 1994 to 1998 and 
from 2006 to 2008, Mayor Tudela was a member 
of the Saipan and Northern Islands Municipal 
Council. She has also served on the 
boards of the Northern Mariana Islands Retirement 
Fund and the Commonwealth Ports Authority. 


As mayor, Ms. Tudela oversees a staff of 
approximately 40 hard-working members of 
our community. Her office undertakes programs 
and projects that range from improving 
local infrastructure to fostering better relations 
with our tourism partner countries. For example, 
each year, the mayor’s office sponsors 
exchange programs among our high school 
students and students from Japan and Korea. 
And on any given day, you can find her employees 
trimming trees to make our beautiful 
lagoon more visible to tourists traveling on 
Beach Road, patching potholes on secondary 
roads or catching stray dogs that roam the 
streets. Couples intending to wed visit the 
mayor’s office to obtain their marriage license, 
and those who do not drive but desire identification 
cards can receive those through her 
office. The mayor’s office also spearheads the 
annual Liberation Day festivities on Saipan, 
which celebrates the freeing of our islands 
from occupying Japanese forces by the American 
military in 1944. 

Mayor Tudela is now one of the highest-
ranking female officials ever to hold office in 
the Northern Mariana Islands. And as such, 
she serves as a role model and a reminder to 
all women that they have come of age in our 
local political arena. But championing women’s 
issues is nothing new to Mayor Tudela. She 
formerly served as a Governor’s Special Assistant 
for Women’s Affairs, and over the 
years has participated in numerous symposia 
addressing issues of import to women in the 
Pacific region. 

Marian Deleon Guerrero Tudela’s willingness 
to step into this position so unexpectedly, 

serve so unassumingly and carry on the fine 
tradition not only of her predecessor but of the 
mayors of all our islands should serve as an 
inspiration for women, but more, should serve 
as a model for all people who aspire to serve 
their communities.

A TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER 
GENERAL JAMES DEREK HILL 

HON. TOM LATHAM 

OF IOWA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. LATHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the retirement of Brigadier General 
James Derek Hill of the Iowa Air National 
Guard and to congratulate him on his illustrious 
29-year military career. 

General Hill began his military service in 
1985 upon receiving his commission through 
Direct Appointment. Eighteen years later, General 
Hill joined the Iowa Air National Guard as 
a Lieutenant Colonel and has faithfully devoted 
the following decade to guiding our 
state’s men and women in uniform. General 
Hill retired as the Iowa Air National Guard’s 
Deputy Adjutant General where he served as 
principal advisor to Iowa’s Adjutant General 
while organizing, manning, equipping, and 
training more than 1,800 airmen to accomplish 
missions assigned at both the state and national 
level. General Hill’s unfailing leadership 
has proven to be instrumental in preparing the 
men and women of the Iowa Air National 
Guard for numerous successful deployments 
in an often chaotic and unpredictable environment. 


Throughout nearly three decades of selfless 
service, General Hill has earned numerous 
decorations for his consistent leadership and 
uncompromising standards. Most recently, 
General Hill was nominated by Iowa’s Adjutant 
General Timothy Orr to receive the hallowed 
Legion of Merit for his ‘‘exceptionally meritorious 
conduct’’ as Iowa’s Assistant Adjutant 
General over the past four years. I believe it 
goes without saying that the Iowa Air National 
Guard’s world-renowned 21st century capabilities 
would not be possible without the positive 
and professional guidance expertly offered by 
General Hill over the past decade. 

Mr. Speaker, our country owes Brigadier 
General James Derek Hill a great debt of gratitude 
for his decades of selfless service and 
sacrifice. His unwavering commitment to his 
country and fellow Americans is a testament 
to our nation’s service members and our great 
state. I know my colleagues in the United 
States House of Representatives will join me 
in thanking General Hill and congratulating 
him on a truly stellar career. In retirement, 
General Hill leaves behind a grateful state and 
nation and I wish him, and his wife Rhonda, 
the very best as they begin a new chapter in 
their lives. 

IN MEMORY OF DEPUTY DANNY 
OLIVER 

HON. TOM McCLINTOCK 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
along with Representative AMI BERA, Representative 
DORIS MATSUI, and Representative 
DOUG LAMALFA, in honor of the service and 
sacrifice of Sacramento County, California, 
Sheriff Deputy Danny Oliver. 

Danny Oliver grew up in the Del Paso 
Heights neighborhood of Sacramento, where 
he graduated from Grant High School. During 
his youth, Danny experienced parts of the 
community that he was determined to improve. 
This drove his desire to work in law enforcement, 
even though he came from a family 
of firefighters. 

Danny finished the academy at the top of 
his class and served with the Sheriff’s Department 
for fifteen years. In keeping with the life-
long goal of cleaning up his community, Deputy 
Oliver worked on a highly competitive 
team of problem-oriented policing officers. 

Tragically, Deputy Oliver was killed in the 
line of duty on October 24, 2014, during a violent 
crime spree that would later take the life 
of another officer, Detective Michael David 
Davis, Jr. Deputy Oliver died for his love of 
and devotion to his community. 

Danny loved going into his job an hour early 
every morning, knowing he was putting his life 
on the line to make a difference in Sacramento 
County. While his sacrifice is to be 
honored, this is not his legacy. Rather, 
Danny’s legacy is the memory of the man he 
lived his life as: a devoted husband to his wife 
Susan, a father who guided and supported his 
two children, and a dedicated officer. 

Mr. Speaker, Deputy Danny Oliver will be 
deeply and sorely missed not only by his family, 
but also by the community that he tirelessly 
worked to better. The State of California 
is particularly blessed to have such men of 
character and heroism protecting our citizens. 

Danny was known for influencing his children 
to do what they love, just as he did. We 
can all learn from his heart and strength of 
character. It is my privilege to rise in recognition 
of his sacrifice and to honor his memory.

Mr. DESJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today

Alexis for her project on raising awareness 
about Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Additionally, Alexis 
also earned the Girl Scout Journey Award and 
completed over 50 hours of work and planning 
devoted to this cause. 

In the spring of 2013, Alexis began to research 
CF, a disease her sister has been diagnosed 
with. Shortly thereafter, she compiled 
a learning board exhibit which detailed the effects 
caused by CF. 

Over the next several months, Miss Hardrick 
traveled to various events around Lewisburg, 
Tennessee, discussing her learning board and 
arranging activities to promote a greater understanding 
of CF. Moreover, during the fall of 
2013, Alexis enlisted the help of her Girl Scout 
Troop to host CF Awareness Day and from all 
accounts was a great success. 

On behalf of the people of Tennessee’s 
Fourth Congressional District, I want to congratulate 
Alexis on receiving the Silver Award 
and thank her for her dedication and hard 
work in raising awareness for Cystic Fibrosis.

CONGRATULATING THE JOHN F. 
KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS 
VOLLEYBALL TEAM FOR WINNING 
THE CHICAGO CITY CHAMPIONSHIP 


HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the John F. Kennedy High School Girls 
Volleyball team. On October 17, the Crusaders 
won the Chicago Public League Championship 
and became the first non-selective 
enrollment school to win in nearly a decade. I 
appreciate all of the incredibly hard work and 
dedication everyone on the team puts into 
their sport and would like to congratulate them 
on this tremendous achievement. 

The 25–21, 22–25, 25–20 win over Whitney 
Young Magnet School was a monumental victory 
for neighborhood schools. Coached by 
Tim Laughlin and Kimberly Thinnes, the Crusaders 
finished the season with a 16–1 
record, securing the top seed in the tournament. 
To get to the championship, the Crusaders 
had to get through Young High School 
and Payton High School, who between them 
have won 7 city championships. The Crusaders 
are composed of seniors Grace 
Jurevis, Nebal Algoleh, Dana Majerczy, Sydney 
McCarthy, Melissa Mazur, and Morgan 
Paske, along with freshman Johanna Hoefling. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing this impressive accomplishment 
made by the John F. Kennedy High School 
Girls Volleyball team and to congratulate them 
on their city championship win.

RECOGNIZING DR. SHAFI AHMED 
FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND 
SERVICE AS PRESIDENT OF THE 
GENESEE COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY 


HON. DANIEL T. KILDEE 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I ask the United 
States House of Representatives to join me in 

recognizing Dr. Shafi Ahmed, President of the 
Genesee County Medical Society, for his outstanding 
service and unwavering commitment 
to community. 

Dr. Ahmed lived in several countries before 
moving to the United States of America, where 
he now practices internal medicine at Court 
Street Family Medicine. Dr. Ahmed is a kindhearted 
individual who has lived a broad life. 

After graduation from medical school, he 
worked in the capital of Bangladesh and completed 
two years of surgical residency. He 
then went to Algeria to practice in a government 
clinic for four years. He was recruited to 
Saudi Arabia, Libya and Iran but political 
chaos eventually landed him in Algeria. 

Dr. Ahmed’s wife, Ruqsana, became pregnant 
while the Ahmeds were living in Algeria. 
She returned to Bangladesh to stay with his 
parents and joined Dr. Ahmed eight months 
later in the United States where he had begun 
studying for Masters in Public Health in Dallas. 
Dr. Ahmed then switched to a research associate 
position in a cancer research institute in 
Dallas for three years. His ‘‘big break,’’ as he 
refers to it, occurred when Dr. Norwood Hill 
took him under his wing along with a Pakistani 
oncologist, Dr. Amanullah Khan, helped him 
get a permanent visa and a residency at Hurley 
Medical Center in Flint, MI. 

Dr. Ahmed decided to stay in Michigan to 
raise his family and make a living practicing 
medicine. He is honored to be a resident of 
Genesee County, and we are grateful to have 
him. Our community is made better because 
of people such as him. 

Mr. Speaker, I applaud Dr. Shafi Ahmed for 
his resilience, strong leadership, and unwavering 
commitment to our community.

RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBU


TIONS OF HENRY ERNEST 

LOWENSTEIN 

HON. DIANA DeGETTE 

OF COLORADO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of one of Colorado’s most respected 
and honorable residents, Mr. Henry Ernest 
Lowenstein, who passed away October 7 at 
age 89. This remarkable man merits both our 
recognition for decades of work in the theater 
and gratitude for his unwavering efforts to improve 
our community. He leaves behind an 
impressive body of theatrical work as well as 
his legacy of encouragement and mentorship 
not just in the arts, but for social justice as 
well. He made an enormous impact on scores 
of lives and is widely considered one of the 
most important people in the shaping of Denver. 


Henry Lowenstein was born in Berlin on the 
4th of July in 1925, to parents Max and Maria 
Lowenstein, whose home became a magnet 
for that city’s arts scene. In fact, Henry often 
told the story of listening to Kurt Weill compose 
the now classic Three Penny Opera in 
his parent’s apartment. But Berlin in the 
1930’s was no place to raise a Jewish family. 
Fearing for the safety of their son following the 
harrowing Kristallnacht in 1938, Henry would 
become part of history himself as a child of 
the Kindertransport program, which saved the 
lives of thousands of children before the out


break of World War II. Miraculously, the 
Lowenstein family was reunited after the war 
and was able to immigrate to America in 1947. 
Consistently fighting against discrimination in 
any form, Henry held a deep compassion for 
artists and outcasts. This passion, born from 
the horrors of Nazi Germany, would shape the 
artist he would become. 

After working for years as a foundry man 
and a gravedigger, Henry joined the U.S. Air 
Force, where he worked as an illustrator before 
attending Yale University. While at Yale 
he studied theatrical design and worked as a 
stagehand on Broadway. It was during that 
time he received a call from the Denver Post 
publisher, Mrs. Helen Bonfils, who was the 
wife of theater producer George Somnes. That 
1956 request to run what would become the 
nationally recognized Bonfils Theatre changed 
not only Henry’s life but the lives of hundreds 
of artists over the next five decades. Henry 
earned the nickname ‘‘Father of Denver Theater.’’ 
The Bonfils Theatre produced more than 
400 plays, operas, ballet, children’s theater, 
and touring productions until it closed in 1986 
by which time it had been renamed the 
Lowenstein Theater. It was then that Mr. 
Lowenstein retired—for the first time. The next 
stage in Mr. Lowenstein’s theatrical life was to 
found the Denver Civic Theater which he ran 
until his second retirement in 1995, although 
Henry never fully retired. He was a prolific 
scenic and costume designer and contributed 
designs into the early 2000’s. 

Mr. Lowenstein’s passion for theater was 
equaled by his commitment to human rights. 
Henry was a prolific mentor, particularly for 
women and people of color. His hiring practices, 
like his theatrical productions, consistently 
broke down racial and societal barriers. 
His work was so important to the theatrical 
community that the Colorado Theater Guild’s 
annual theater awards were renamed ‘‘The 
Henry’s’’ in his honor in 2008. In his later 
years, Mr. Lowenstein was also actively involved 
in the historical preservation of personal 
artifacts related to his family’s experience 
in Nazi Germany. 

Mr. Lowenstein is survived by his wife, 
Deborah Goodman Lowenstein and sons 
David, Daniel and Joshua by his late wife, 
Doris Brewer, and his granddaughters Sarah 
and Nyssa. 

Please join me in commending Mr. Henry 
Lowenstein for his leadership in the search for 
justice, equality and beauty through the vehicle 
called theater; which dares to show us our 
humanity. Henry’s generosity of spirit, kindness 
and compassion continues to enhance 
our lives and builds a better future for us all.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF MR. 
VERNON H. HUKLE JR.

Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize 
an outstanding individual, Mr. Vernon 

H. Hukle Jr. of Winchester, Kentucky, for his 
distinguished military service during World 
War II. Mr. Hukle served our nation in uniform 
from October 20, 1942 to November 20, 1945. 
As a young man, Mr. Hukle began his service 
in the United States Marine Corps as a 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1511 

Corporal within the 2nd Marine Division—8th 
Regiment—1st Battalion—Company C 182. 
He entered the war against the Axis Powers 
by storming the deadly beaches of Okinawa 
and fought valiantly, sustaining serious injuries 
during combat. 

On June 20, 1945, Mr. Hukle received two 
separate bullet wounds to his arm and leg. 
Throughout the heated battle, Mr. Hukle witnessed 
many of his comrades killed in action 
including the 10th Army Commander, Lieutenant 
General Simon Bolivor Buckner Jr. The 
battled raged on for two more days until Allied 
Forces were able claim victory in controlling 
the island on June 22, 1945. Mr. Hukle received 
two Purple Hearts for being wounded 
in action by an enemy of the United States. 

Mr. Hukle embodies the best of America’s 
ideals, values, and work ethic. He served this 
nation proudly, answering the call to prevent 
the Axis Powers threat from arriving on our 
shores. 

Mr. Hukle’s bravery and that of his fellow 
men and women in uniform protected our 
American freedoms for future generations. He 
is truly an outstanding American and an inspiration 
to us all.

HONORING ST. JANE DE CHANTAL 

PARISH ON ITS 60TH ANNIVER


SARY 

HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor St. Jane de Chantal Parish on its 60th 
anniversary as a Catholic community of faith 
in Chicago, Illinois. St. Jane de Chantal embodies 
the core pillars of the Roman Catholic 
Church and its congregation upholds the values 
and practices of Catholicism through their 
devotion to charity and spiritual development. 
From humble beginnings in 1954, Father John 
Ward organized the first Mass at the Mark 
Twain Public School, which he rented for $96 
on a Sunday. Today, the parish celebrates 60 
years of faithful service to God and to the Garfield 
Ridge community and to the 3rd District 
of Illinois. 

St. Jane de Chantal Parish is currently led 
by Fr. Ed Cronin, with Fr. Joe Mol in residence 
and Fr. John Wachala as the Polish Associate. 
As part of the Archdiocese of Chicago, 
the parish offers daily masses, community-
building events, and countless fundraising 
and community-outreach events. The Parish 
hosts blood drives on Saturdays and food 
drives on the weekends. In November, they 
run a Hungry and Homeless Turkey Tree program 
in which families from the Parish sponsor 
needy families from the community and 
provide them with Thanksgiving meals. 

The Polish Ministry of St. Jane de Chantal 
supports the Polish community by offering five 
services a week as well as other special 
Masses and events. The school, led by Principal 
Nancy Andrasco, provides a Catholic 
education for children starting in pre-school up 
to the eighth grade. Children are taught the 
Catholic ideals of love, sacrifice, and charity 
while receiving an outstanding education in a 
compassionate and supportive environment. 

I am happy to join with St. Jane de Chantal 
Parish and help commemorate its 60th anniversary. 
I am confident that they will continue 
to perpetuate Catholic ideals by providing spiritual 
nourishment through worship and service 
to their community. Mr. Speaker, St. Jane de 
Chantal is an exemplary Catholic parish and I 
ask my colleagues to join me as I extend my 
blessings to all the parishioners on this significant 
milestone.

SARY OF EDGEWATER BEHAV


IORAL HEALTH SERVICES 

HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I recognize 
Edgewater Behavioral Health Services as the 
organization celebrates its 40th anniversary. In 
honor of this momentous occasion, the organization 
is hosting a celebratory event on Friday, 
October 17, 2014, at the Radisson Hotel 
at Star Plaza, in Merrillville, Indiana. 

The growing need for quality mental health 
care in the United States led to Congress 
passing the Community Mental Health Act of 
1963. The Gary Community Mental Health 
Center was one of the original facilities set up 
in Indiana after the passage of this bill. In 
1974, due to the hard work of many leaders 
in Gary at the time, the center was incorporated 
as a not-for-profit organization. Over 
the years, the organization continued to grow, 
expanding its range of services and leadership. 
Under the direction of current president 
and chief executive officer, Dr. Danita Johnson 
Hughes, the center’s name was changed to 
Edgewater Systems for Balanced Living, Inc. 
and, in 2014, began doing business under the 
name Edgewater Behavioral Health Services. 
Edgewater provides services ranging from crisis 
intervention and addiction services to day 
treatment, out-patient programs, and residential 
services, to name a few. Due to the outstanding 
leadership of Dr. Johnson Hughes 
and the entire staff, Edgewater currently provides 
services for over 30,000 clients each 
year. The organization also provides over $3 
million in services to charity cases. 

Edgewater partners with other service providers, 
groups, and organizations in order to 
meet the needs of each person that walks 
through its doors. This year, Edgewater is 
honoring Dr. Daniel Lowery, Ph.D., president 
of Calumet College of Saint Joseph, with the 
Commonweal Award for Personal and Professional 
Leadership. This award recognizes distinctive 
contributions made by individuals who 
hold the value of the common good over personal 
gain. The Sojourner Truth House, a ministry 
for women and children in Gary, will be 
honored with the Commonweal Award for Institutional 
Leadership. This award recognizes 
institutional and organizational leadership that 
promotes the common good within communities 
faced with long-term, difficult challenges. 
For their exceptional commitment to the community 
of Northwest Indiana, and for touching 
the lives of countless individuals, each recipient 
is worthy of the honors bestowed upon 
them. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished 
colleagues join me in honoring 
Edgewater Behavioral Health Services as the 
organization celebrates its 40th anniversary. 
Edgewater has played an important role in enriching 
the quality of life in Northwest Indiana. 
As a community we are grateful and proud to 
have had its support during the past 40 years. 
For its remarkable leadership, devotion, and 
compassion shown in its service to so many in 
need, Edgewater is worthy of the highest 
praise.

Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Jasmine Babers of Rock Island, 
Illinois, who is one of ten individuals nationwide 
to receive the USA Network’s Characters 
Unite award this year. 

Jasmine Babers, at a very young age, has 
shown an amazing amount of dedication, hard 
work, and drive. She is the founder and publisher 
of Love, GIRLS, a magazine that strives 
to build confidence and self-esteem in teenage 
girls. Jasmine’s hard work has paid off as she 
was able to publish the first issue in 2012. 
Love, GIRLS has expanded its distribution 
over the past two years from Illinois to include 
Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, as well as 
the District of Columbia, reaching more than 
5,000 young girls. Jasmine also has led local 
events, in conjunction with her magazine, that 
help bring attention to bullying and the dangerous 
effects that it can have on our youth. 

The Characters Unite award is presented 
annually to ten individuals who through extraordinary 
efforts are able to combat hate, intolerance, 
and discrimination, as well as make 
significant contributions towards promoting 
greater tolerance, respect, and acceptance in 
their communities. 

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to know that individuals 
like Jasmine Babers are making a difference 
in our communities. Once again I 
would like to congratulate her on her momentous 
achievement and wish her luck with her 
ongoing efforts, as well as her upcoming collegiate 
career.

HONORING PARK LABREA NEWS 
AND BEVERLY PRESS 

HON. HENRY A. WAXMAN 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the Park Labrea News and Beverly 
Press. 

Park Labrea News and Beverly Press has 
been a local paper and critical presence in 
Miracle Mile, Hancock Park, Hollywood and 
West Hollywood since 1946. Park Labrea 
news and Beverly Press have a long and important 
history in our community. Residents of 
Park Labrea began distributing a newsletter 
throughout the apartment complex in 1946 
and within a few months ‘‘Parklabrea News’’ 
was born. 

In 1948, Joseph Duplain took over the 
newsletter and converted it into a newspaper. 
In the 1950s, Nan Dayhoff became editor and 
ran the paper for the next twenty years, publishing 
twice a month. In the 1970s veteran TV 
newsman Charles ‘‘Chuck’’ Riley acquired the 
paper. 

In 1990, the newspaper was sold to the current 
publishers, Michael and Karen 
Villalpando. By June 1990, the Villalpandos 
had expanded the paper to a weekly installation 
that reaches more than 5,000 homes in 
neighborhoods in Los Angeles. In 1991, the 
circulation was expanded again and the name 
Beverly Press was added to the original Park 
Labrea News masthead. 

Michael and Karen Villalpando have been 
the publishers for the last twenty-five years 
and have transformed the paper from a 3,000

IN RECOGNITION OF RALPH 
LESLIE BUDDY COLE, JR. 

HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Ralph Leslie Buddy Cole, Jr. for a 
noteworthy life dedicated to public service. Mr. 
Cole passed away at the age of 80, having 
lived a selfless life as a veteran of the Texas 
Air National Guard, public servant, and civic 
leader. 

Buddy was born on August 19th, 1934 and 
grew up picking cotton in Krum, Texas. His 
commitment to public service and civic leadership 
started at a young age, notably when he 
founded the Krum Young Citizens Club and 
subsequently served as its first president. 
Buddy’s public service career included serving 
on Pilot Point’s City Council, first by election in 
1981 and again by appointment in 1986. Additionally, 
he served as Denton County Judge 
for 4 years after being elected in 1982 and 
then served as Denton County Commissioner 
for Precinct 1 after winning election in 1986. 
Buddy is deserving of recognition not only for 
his continuous dedication to civic leadership 
and public service, but also for the example 
he demonstrated in his personal life and character. 
Buddy was regarded throughout the 
community as a pragmatic problem solver, 
something that no doubt contributed to his 
success in public office. 

Buddy is survived by his wife, Norma, his 
sons Alan and Leslie, eight grandchildren and 
five great grandchildren. I join his family and 
the community of lives he touched in celebrating 
the accomplishments of Buddy Cole. It 

is my privilege to represent the 26th District of 
Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives.

RECOGNIZING THE 2014 DISTIN


GUISHED CITIZENS AWARD RE


CIPIENTS 

HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great respect that I take this time to recognize 
the 2014 Distinguished Citizen Award recipients, 
presented annually by the Boy Scouts of 
America Calumet Council. To commemorate 
this special occasion, the organization hosted 
a celebratory event on Monday, November 3, 
2014, at the Center for Visual and Performing 
Arts in Munster, Indiana. 

Since 1992, the Boy Scouts of America Calumet 
Council has presented the Distinguished 
Citizen Award to individuals who have made a 
significant positive impact on the community in 
Northwest Indiana and across the state. This 
year, the Boy Scouts of America Calumet 
Council honored Michael and Jill Schrage. 

Michael Schrage, president and chief executive 
officer of Centier Bank, is a truly innovative 
business leader. Mike became the fourth 
generation of his family to own and operate 
the First Bank of Whiting, which was renamed 
Centier Bank years later. This family-owned 
bank has grown throughout the years, and 
today Centier includes over fifty branches in 
Indiana. Under Mr. Schrage’s leadership, an 
award winning lender division was established, 
a financial literacy program was introduced, 
and the company has been named one of Indiana’s 
best places to work for the past eight 
years. This is unquestionably due to Mike’s 
value-based work ethic, and the importance 
he places on Centier’s most important resource: 
its employees. Additionally, Mike gives 
much of his time and efforts to charitable endeavors, 
including the Saint Jude House, the 
American Red Cross, the YMCA, and the Boy 
Scouts of America, to name a few. 

Jill Schrage is a true humanitarian in every 
sense of the word. She gives selflessly and 
passionately of her time and efforts to various 
organizations and civic activities throughout 
Northwest Indiana and beyond, including the 
American Heart Association, the American 
Cancer Society, TradeWinds, Speaking of 
Women’s Health, the Girl Scouts of America, 
the Women’s Association of the Northwest Indiana 
Symphony, Opportunity Enterprises, and 
the Valparaiso Art Advisory Committee, 
among others. For her truly exceptional devotion 
to such worthy causes, Jill serves as an 
inspiration to us all. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other 
distinguished colleagues join me in honoring 
the Boy Scouts of America Calumet Council 
and its 2014 Distinguished Citizen Award recipients, 
Michael and Jill Schrage. For their 
lifetime of leadership and outstanding dedication 
to serving those in need, Mike and Jill are 
worthy of the highest praise.

IN HONOR OF BEVERLY ANN 
NEWELL 

HON. SAM FARR 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and memory of Beverly Ann 
Newell, a truly remarkable woman who enriched 
us all. Beverly’s recent death has left 
her family and friends with a deep sense of 
grief, though the memory of her life still shines 
brightly. 

Beverly was born in December, 1936 in Albuquerque 
N.M., the descendant of New Mexico 
and Colorado pioneers. She moved with 
her family to Seattle where she grew into a vibrant 
young woman. Beverly attended the University 
of Washington where she began her 
lifetime career in physical therapy. She quickly 
followed with a masters degree in physical 
therapy from Stanford University. Then in 
1961, she found herself in Switzerland where 
she met a young traveling American student 
named Roger Newell. 

In 1965, Beverly and Roger married and 
began a long honeymoon on the Newell family 

ranch in Big Sur. After living in the San Francisco 
Bay Area for a few years, they returned 
to Big Sur to raise their children Mark, Jonathan, 
and Annika. At the same time, Beverly 
became an integral part of the Big Sur community. 
She took active roles with the Big Sur 
Volunteer Ambulance Service and the Big Sur 
Historical Society. And in an effort that has 
had tremendous long term value, Beverly 
helped co-found the Big Sur Land Trust, which 
has played a pivotal role in the intervening 
years in preserving Big Sur’s incomparable 
natural landscape. 

As their children entered high school, Beverly 
and Roger moved up the coast to the 
Monterey Peninsula. Beverly became active 
with her church, Mayflower Presbyterian, 
where her deep faith helped her serve many 
years as a deacon. As her children grew and 
moved away, Beverly returned to her professional 
life as a physical therapist working with 
elderly patients in local nursing homes as well 
as people suffering from cerebral palsy. She 
also devoted herself to the lives of her grandchildren: 
Kyler, Micaela, Ohanapecosh, and 
Tole. 

Beverly was the sort of person who had a 
tremendous influence on the lives of the people 
around her. She was invariably kind and 
loving. People’s lives were enriched from the 
simple joy of being with her. She was also 
inexhaustibly creative. She was a phenomenal 
pianist who could play just about anything 
from ear. She also loved creating beauty with 
her hands whether through weaving, sewing, 
ceramics, gardening, or many other ways. 

Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for the whole 
House in offering our condolences to Beverly’s 
family and friends. While we mourn her death, 
we celebrate the gift that her life was to all of 
us. The world is a far better place because 
Beverly lived her life with her own particular 
style of love and joy.

HONORING DR. FRANCIS X. VAN 
LIESHOUT 

HON. REID J. RIBBLE 

OF WISCONSIN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. RIBBLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Dr. Francis X. Van Lieshout on his 87th 
birthday, which he celebrated on October 11, 
2014. Dr. Van Lieshout has been an integral 
member of the Fox Valley community and I 
am proud to recognize his dedicated service 
to the people of Wisconsin. 

Dr. Van Lieshout was born in Kimberly, Wisconsin 
on October 11, 1927. After graduating 
from Kimberly High School in 1945, Dr. Van 
Lieshout served for three years overseas in 
the U.S. Navy. Upon returning to the United 
States, he received his undergraduate and 
medical degrees from Marquette University. 

Dr. Van Lieshout returned to Little Chute 
with his wife Josephine after graduating from 
medical school. There, he and his wife raised 
seven children. He practiced family medicine 
in Little Chute for 42 years, working long 
hours at the hospital and making house calls 
following work. After retiring from medicine, he 
dedicated his time to volunteering in the community, 
working at St. Vincent de Paul and St. 
Bernadette’s parish in Appleton, WI. 

He has received multiple awards for his 
service to the community, dedication to Catho


lic education, and service to the poor. In 1999, 
Van Lieshout Park was named in his honor in 
Little Chute. 

Today, Dr. Van Lieshout and his wife live in 
Appleton, where he enjoys volunteering, 
spending time with his family and friends, and 
fishing. It is truly an honor to represent an extraordinary 
citizen who has dedicated his life 
to serving the people of the Fox River Valley 
in Northeastern Wisconsin. 

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 8th district of 
Wisconsin, I congratulate Dr. Van Lieshout on

HONORING JERRY HANAS 

HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I stand before you today to 
honor Jerry Hanas and to wish him well upon 
his retirement as General Manager of the 
Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation 
District. Mr. Hanas’s many years of service 
and expertise in his field have been a remarkable 
asset to the community of Northwest Indiana 
and beyond. In honor of Jerry’s retirement, 
a celebratory reception was held on 
Wednesday, November 5, 2014, at Sand 
Creek Country Club in Chesterton, Indiana. 

Northwest Indiana’s extensive transportation 
network earns this region’s reputation for 
being the crossroads of America. Interstates 
80, 94, 90, and 65 traverse our landscape, as 
do the railroad tracks servicing the Norfolk 
Southern, Canadian National, and CSX rail 
lines, connecting travelers and business interests 
alike from the East to West Coasts. Most 
notably, the South Shore Rail Line, a passenger 
rail service offered by the Northern Indiana 
Commuter Transportation District 
(NICTD), provides riders access to the environs 
of Chicago and its $500 billion economy. 
Under Mr. Hanas’s direction, NICTD and the 
South Shore Rail Line have flourished. 

Established in 1908, the South Shore Rail 
Line provided passenger service to the city of 
Chicago as well as to the recreational opportunities 
found in Northwest Indiana, given its 
proximity to Lake Michigan and South Bend. 
With the advent of the interstate system, and 
the newfound ability to travel between neighboring 
communities with ease, ridership along 
the South Shore Rail Line began to decline. In 
order to prevent the complete loss of this 
asset, the state of Indiana created NICTD for 
the sole purpose of maintaining and operating 
the passenger line. Jerry Hanas was hired as 
the General Manager of NICTD upon its creation 
in June 1977, and it is here where he 
has served the railroad for 37 years. 

NICTD’s success is due to Jerry’s competence, 
hard work, and dedication to a long-
term vision in which passenger rail service is 
improved and expanded throughout the region. 
He effectively coordinated NICTD’s purchase 
of the South Shore railroad and passenger 
assets, resulting in a stable and reliable 
relationship between the passenger and 
freight services. This acquisition required a 
steadfast commitment to a series of strategic 
investments to ensure the line’s continuation. 
To that end, under Jerry’s leadership, since 
1977, over $500 million has been dedicated to 
upgrading the rolling stock, stations, track, catenary, 
bridges, and signals associated with 
the line in order to enhance safety and to 
make much needed capacity-related track improvements. 


Currently, NICTD is in the process of conducting 
the appropriate environmental studies 
as part of its effort to expand services to the 

suburban areas in Northwest Indiana. This expansion 
is a key component to capitalizing 
upon our region’s transportation network and 
maximizing economic development opportunities. 
Although Jerry Hanas retires this fall, he 
leaves a completely rebuilt and vibrant South 
Shore Rail Line to serve as his legacy and a 
well-established corporate vision to keep the 
momentum going for future generations. 

Jerry’s commitment to his career and to the 
community of Northwest Indiana is exceeded 
only by his devotion to his family. He and his 
wonderful wife, Nancy, have a daughter, Melissa, 
son-in-law, Tom, and one beloved 
grandson, Donovan. They also have one son, 
Roger, whose fiance´e, Annie, will be joining 
Jerry’s exceptional family. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other 
distinguished colleagues join me in commending 
Jerry Hanas for his lifetime of leadership, 
service, and dedication to the Northern 
Indiana Commuter Transportation District. Jerry’s 
impact on the region will be evident for 
generations to come, and he is worthy of the 
highest praise. I ask that you join me in wishing 
him well upon his retirement.

IN MEMORY OF DETECTIVE 
MICHAEL DAVID DAVIS, JR. 

HON. TOM McCLINTOCK 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
along with Representative DOUG LAMALFA, in 
honor of the service and sacrifice of Placer 
County, California, Sheriff Detective Michael 
David Davis, Jr. 

A long-time resident of Roseville, Detective 
Davis was a man of integrity and compassion. 
He cared about the community and took initiative 
to protect and better it. Such an example 
would be when Michael organized a funeral 
for an abandoned baby. 

On October 24th, Detective Davis displayed 
immense courage and gallantry during a manhunt 
for the murderer of a fellow officer, Sacramento 
County Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver. 
Detective Davis was killed in the line of duty, 
just as his father was struck down 26 years 
prior to the day. 

Detective Davis faithfully and honorably 
served the Placer County community, joining 
the Sheriff’s office in 1996. For the past fifteen 
years, Michael contributed to his family’s legacy 
of law enforcement, just as his father did 
before him. Michael tirelessly worked as a 
homicide investigator, but he will be remembered 
for much more. 

His bravery and kind soul will never be forgotten. 
He was a family man, devoted to his 
loving wife and four children. Michael is also 
survived by his four siblings, mother and step-
father. 

Mr. Speaker, Detective Michael David 
Davis, Jr. will be deeply and sorely missed not 
only by his family, but also by his community. 
The State of California, and particularly the 
Fourth Congressional District, was blessed to 
have had such a man of character and 
heroism protecting our citizens. 

Michael’s legacy will live on in the lives that 
he touched. Just as he served, he died embodying 
the virtues that form the foundation of 
this great nation. It is my privilege to rise in 

recognition of his sacrifice for Placer County 
and to honor his memory.

life as a lifelong resident of Chicago and 
has lived in my district for over 60 years. 

Virginia Wood has devoted much of her 
time as a High School Physical Education 
Teacher for the Chicago Board of Education, 
teaching at several schools including South 
Shore High School and Bogan High School. 
Ms. Wood was then promoted to Coordinator 
of girl’s athletics for the Chicago Board of 
Education, eventually retiring with over 26 
years of service. Even after retirement, she remained 
an active supporter of girls high school 
sports. 

Ms. Wood has enjoyed a very active life, 
continuing to swim and bowl until she reached 
the age of 96. She has never missed voting in 
an election, and became involved with the 
neighborhood watch program for the Chicago 
Police Department. She is a model participant 
in her community, and we should all try to 
emulate her outstanding service. 

Ms. Wood has led an extraordinary life that 
has given so much to others. I join her many 
family members and friends in celebrating this 
event and I wish her more years of happiness, 
fulfillment, and health. Congratulations to Ms. 
Wood on her centennial birthday milestone.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF REGIS 
GROFF 

HON. DIANA DeGETTE 

OF COLORADO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor 
the life of one of Denver’s most respected 
residents, former Colorado State Senator 
Regis Groff, who passed away on October 5 
at age 79. This remarkable man merits both 
our recognition and gratitude for his unwavering 
efforts to stand for what’s right. He leaves 
behind an impressive record of leadership in 
social justice and education, and he made an 
enormous impact on many lives. 

Regis Groff wasn’t afraid to fight the tough 
battles when he knew he was standing up for 
others. He worked to strengthen education 
and to ensure a fair system for everyone. He 
was an educator, a state senator and a community 
servant. We in Colorado are fortunate 
to have had Mr. Groff laboring for equality in 
our community. The legacy that he leaves behind 
should inspire us all to continue his fight 
with a measure of dedication with which he 
worked. 

Born in a small town in Illinois, Regis Groff 
first came to Denver while serving in the 
United States Air Force, where he was stationed 
at Lowry Air Force Base for several 
months. He returned to Illinois and attended 
Western Illinois University earning a BA in 
1962. When it came time to settle down and 
raise a family, he chose to make Denver 
home. He taught at Smiley and Lake Junior 
High Schools before starting an African-American 
history class at East High School. Later 
he earned a master’s in Education from the 
University of Denver in 1972. 

A long-standing interest in politics led him to 
run for the Colorado State Senate. He was 
successful in his bid and served from 1974 to 
1994. During those twenty years, he demonstrated 
time and again his willingness to 
fight for fairness and justice, including an effort 
to divest Colorado from South Africa’s apartheid 
government. He cites the highlight of his 
time in the Senate as passing legislation that 
established a holiday for Martin Luther King, 
Jr. in Colorado. His colleagues recognized his 
leadership and elected him the first African-
American Minority Leader of the Colorado 
State Senate. His efforts were also rewarded 
with numerous awards from the community, 
including Legislator of the Year from the Associated 
Press. 

Roy Romer appointed Regis as the first Director 
of the new Youthful Offenders System. 
His dedication to community service then continued 
in his role as Executive Director of the 
Metro Black Church Initiative. He was selfless 

to the end. As a teacher, Mr. Groff had an impact 
on countless students. I hope some of 
them are as inspired by him as I am and will 
carry on his work to fight the good fight. His 
talents and perseverance are an example for 
us all. 

Please join me in commending Regis Groff. 
His leadership in the search for justice and 
equality enriches our lives and builds a better 
future for everyone living in Colorado.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize

Roscoe R. Cassidy of Preston, Kentucky. Mr. 
Cassidy served our nation in military uniform 
from June 3, 1942 to October 9, 1945 and recently

As a young man, Mr. Cassidy began his 
service in the United States Army as a Private 
First Class assigned to Company E, 335th Engineering 
Regiment, Duty Soldier 188. During 
the United States’ campaign to achieve victory 
over the Axis Powers, Mr. Cassidy fought his 
way from Tunisia, Africa, up through southern 
France, across Italy and did not stop until the 
Allies achieved victory in Germany. 

Mr. Cassidy’s valiant performance fighting in 
four major campaigns earned him great distinction, 
and for his actions he received the 
European Middle Eastern Campaign Ribbon, 
four Bonze Stars, and a Good Conduct Medal. 

After victoriously returning to his home in 
Preston, Kentucky, Mr. Cassidy began his career 
of farming and working for the Bath 
County Road Department. Mr. Cassidy enjoyed 
life and loved to dance while listening to 
country and bluegrass music. 

Mr. Cassidy’s bravery and that of his fellow 
men and women in uniform protected our 
American freedoms for future generations. He 
was truly an outstanding American, a protector 
of freedom, and an inspiration to us all.

members stationed overseas. For her efforts, 
she is being honored by her family, 
friends, and the members of the Omni Club for 
her tireless and selfless service to our armed 
forces. 

Ms. Sissel has made her care packages, or 
love boxes as she prefers to call them, a personal 
mission to show each service member 
that someone back home is thinking of them 
and cares about their well being. Although 
fourteen years is a long time, her service did 
not start in 2002. Ms. Sissel started her mission 
during the Vietnam War. Through the 

years, she has sent at least one package per 
week at her own expense. As a token of remembrance, 
Ms. Sissel has created scrap 
books containing every letter that she has received 
from recipients of her care packages. 

However, her efforts did not stop at her front 
door. Ms. Sissel has also led many Odessa 
organizations to join her mission in showing 
our armed service members that they are in 
our thoughts and prayers back home. She has 
brought together the VFW and local churches 
to help in running community care package 
drives. These care package drives allow people 
to donate goods or their time to help fill 
care packages for our veterans. 

Clara Sissel’s selflessness and determined 
dedication embody the American spirit and 
has lifted the hearts of thousands of service 
members worldwide. Her weekly token of appreciation 
reminds our service members that 
their daily sacrifices are not taken for granted, 
and I am sure they are thankful for Ms. 
Sissel’s support. I am honored to recognize 
her as a true patriot in our community and to 
share her story with you all today.

IN HONOR OF BOB LEE 

HON. SAM FARR 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the memory of Bob Lee, a champion for 
justice who committed his life to public service 
and worked tirelessly to assure that the Central 
Coast of California is a safe place to live 
for all. 

Bob launched his career in 1985 as a prosecutor 
in Monterey County before joining the 
Santa Cruz County District Attorney’s Office in 
1988, where he served as Assistant District 
Attorney for fourteen years. Bob was a notably 
gifted trial attorney, having never lost a case 
in Santa Cruz County. 

Bob was elected Santa Cruz District Attorney 
in 2002. As District Attorney, he made significant 
structural improvements to the District 
Attorney’s Office. He led efforts in developing 
and strengthening specialized units that prosecuted 
gang members, violent criminals, sex 
offenders, and cases involving environment 
and consumer protection abuses. Bob also 
played a pivotal role in establishing the Santa 
Cruz County Gang Task Force, which centered 
on the containment of gang activity and 
prosecution of gang members. 

A native of Santa Cruz, Bob was the youngest 
of four brothers. He earned a Bachelor’s of 
Science Degree in Public Administration from 
California State University of Sacramento in 
1980. His Juris Doctorate was obtained only 
four years later from the University of Santa 
Clara. 

After a long and brave battle with cancer, 
the Central Coast of California mourns the 
loss of one of its strongest leaders. Bob will 
be remembered for his incredible achievements 
in building a safer and more thriving environment 
in Santa Cruz County. He gave his 
life to his service and his fervor for justice will 
forever remain unmatched. The District Attorney’s 
office will certainly cherish Bob’s unforgettable 
dedication and will continue to carry 
out his resolute spirit in future pursuits. Bob 
was also an amazing family man, and is survived 
by his wife, Barbara Lee. 


E1516 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks November 12, 2014 

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory 
of an accomplished seeker of justice and 
loving husband, District Attorney Bob Lee. His 
life, legacy, and service to Santa Cruz County 
will never be forgotten.

HONORING THE RESIDENTS OF 
THE VILLAGE OF PALOS PARK 
ON THE VILLAGE’S CENTENNIAL 
ANNIVERSARY OF ITS INCORPORATION 


HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the residents of the Village of Palos 
Park as they celebrated the 100th anniversary 
of the village’s incorporation on October 31, 
2014. 

European settlers first came to the area 
around the village in 1834. Not long after, the 
building of the Illinois-Michigan Canal—completed 
in 1848—brought an influx of laborers, 
blacksmiths, and woodcutters to join the local 
farmers. A township was organized in 1850 
and named Trenton, but that name was soon 
changed to Palos by the recommendation of 
the first Postmaster, M.S. Powell. 

In the late 1800s the Wabash Railroad was 
extended into the area, allowing people to live 
in along the rail route and commute to work in 
Chicago. The resulting increase in population 
led to the incorporation of the Village of Palos 
Park in 1914. The village attracted many artists, 
writers, and intellectuals and became 
known as a country retreat outside of Chicago. 

Today, Palos Park, under the leadership of 
Mayor John Mahoney, has a little over 4800 
residents who enjoy a residential area nestled 
within beautiful forest preserves. One of the 
special places in Palos Park is the McCord 
Gallery & Cultural Center, which is a learning 
center for the arts and cultural history which 
also showcases artworks of local and regional 
artists. Among the many special events that 
occur in the village every year, I especially 
enjoy participating in the Autumn in the Park 
Festival and Parade in September. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in honoring the residents of Palos Park as 
they celebrate the 100th anniversary of their 
village and to wish them continued success.

SCHOOL MARCHING BAND 

HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the Argyle High School Band from 
Argyle, Texas for their recent outstanding 
achievement in winning the 2014 Class 4A 
UIL Texas State Marching Band Championship. 


Argyle High School’s Band decisively won

’’Alleluia’’ earned the top award and allowed 
them to retain the state title they have held 
since 2008. The accomplished members of 

the Argyle High School Band deserve praise 
for their hard work and commitment. 

I commend the staff and students of Argyle 
High School for their tremendous support of 
the Eagle Band under the dedicated leadership 
of Band Director Kathy Johnson, Associate 
Band Director Michael Lemish, Superintendent 
Telena Wright, and Principal Jeff 
Butts. It is my privilege to represent the administrators, 
teachers, staff and students that 
comprise the Argyle Independent School District 
in the U.S. House of Representatives.

RECOGNIZING THE ASIAN AMER


ICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION 

AND HONOREE BETH WROBEL 

HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with sincere 
admiration that I recognize the Asian 
American Medical Association, which will host 
its 38th Annual Gala on Saturday, November 
15, 2014, at Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana. 
Each year, the Asian American Medical 
Association pays tribute to prominent, outstanding 
citizens and organizations for their 
contributions to the community. In recognition 
of their efforts, these honorees are awarded 
the prestigious Crystal Globe Award at the annual 
banquet. 

The Asian American Medical Association 
has always been a great asset to Northwest 
Indiana. Its members have generously devoted 
themselves to providing superior medical 
services to the residents of Northwest Indiana 
and have always demonstrated exemplary 
service through their many cultural, academic 
and charitable endeavors. 

At this year’s Annual Gala, the Asian American 
Medical Association will present the Crystal 
Globe Award to one of Northwest Indiana’s 
finest citizens, Beth Wrobel. Mrs. Wrobel is to 
be commended for her exceptional contributions 
to her field and her community. 

In 1979, Beth graduated from Valparaiso 
University where she majored in Mechanical 
Engineering. Mrs. Wrobel’s engineering career 
includes twenty years of service with 
NiSource, Inc. Subsequently, in 2007, she 
also earned her Healthcare Executive Certificate 
from the University of California, Los Angeles, 
Anderson School of Business. 

Beth has been the chief executive officer of 
HealthLinc, Incorporated since 2002. She has 
since advanced the organization from a free 
medical clinic serving only adults to a Federally 
Qualified Health Center that provides 
medical services to over 4,000 uninsured or 
underinsured patients, through all life cycles, 
from prenatal to seniors. HealthLinc provides 
comprehensive, quality and affordable care 
that includes medical, dental, optometry and 
behavioral health services at six locations and 
one mobile van in Northern Indiana. 

In 2013, Beth was honored by Northwest Indiana 
Business Quarterly as top not-for-profit 
chief executive officer in Northern Indiana due 
to her success improving and expanding 
HealthLinc from a one-location, small organization, 
known as Hilltop Community Health 
Center, with a budget of less than $350,000 in 
2001, to the multi-location organization that is 
known today, with a budget of $20 million and 

a staff of more than 200 employees. Beth has 
also earned distinction as Porter County Community 
Foundation’s 2012 Outstanding Executive 
and was honored by Porter County United 
Way as an Outstanding Agency Professional 
in 2014. 

Among her many accomplishments, Beth is 
a member of the Indiana Primary Healthcare 
Association Board and has previously held the 
position of president. She also serves as an 
adviser to many medical groups, including Indiana 
University Northwest Medical School, 
and has presented at many conferences, both 
at the national and state level. 

Additionally, Beth selflessly gives of her time 
through her involvement in various organizations 
and civic activities, such as the Porter 
County Reading Foundation Board and the 
City of Valparaiso Human Relations Council. 
She also serves as president-elect of the 
Valparaiso Rotary Club and is an active member 
of Immanuel Lutheran Church. 

Beth’s compassion and dedication to her 
field and her commitment to charitable endeavors 
exemplifies the self-driven person that 
she is and is exceeded only by her devotion 
to her wonderful family. Beth and her husband, 
Joe, have three amazing sons. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other 
distinguished colleagues join me in commending 
the members of the Asian American 
Medical Association, as well as this year’s 
Crystal Globe Award recipient, Beth Wrobel, 
for their outstanding contributions to their community 
and beyond. Their unwavering commitment 
and dedication to improving the quality 
of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and 
throughout the United States is truly inspirational.

HON. KENNY MARCHANT 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the career and celebrate the retirement 
of Rear Admiral Gary W. Rosholt, who 
has served in the United States Navy for over 
thirty-four years and, though with the U.S. Embassy 
at the United Arab Emirates at this time,

distinguished colleagues to join me in marking 
the retirement of Rear Admiral Gary W.

HONORING DIGNITY & MERCY 
ADULT DAYCARE SERVICES 

HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 

OF MISSISSIPPI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Dignity & Mercy Adult 
Daycare Services. 

Tamekia Renix Jackson was born on September 
18, 1974 to Albert Black III and Fannie 
Renix Johnson. Tamekia is the oldest of her 
seven siblings. She is a graduate of the North 
Panola High School Class of 1992. She currently 
resides in Como, MS, where she was 
born and raised. She attends the First Baptist 
Church in Como, where she serves faithfully 
as associate minister, choir president, and 
youth advisor. She serves on the Board of Directors 
for Aaron E. Henry Community Health 
Center and as President of the Mississippi Association 
of Adult Day Services. 

In 1995 Tamekia graduated from the Licensed 
Practical Nursing Course at Northwest 
Community College in Senatobia, MS. She decided 
to further her education by enrolling in 
the Registered Nurse Curriculum in Senatobia, 
MS. She graduated in 2005 and passed her 
NCLEX as a RN. 

Tamekia began working at the age of 15 at 
Wendy’s in Senatobia, MS. After passing her 
LPN NCLEX, she became employed with 
Golden Living Center in Batesville, MS and remained 
with the company for three years 
learning that she really desired the role of RN. 
After becoming an RN she was gainfully employed 
with Baptist Desoto Hospital, where 
she remained for 2 years working in critical 
care. She later moved on to the position of 
travel nurse where she traveled extensively 
and enhanced her skills, gained friends, and 
encountered remarkable experiences. After 
becoming home sick, she accepted a position 

as Director of Nursing for Monette Hospice 
until it closed in 2009. She was then led to 
open Dignity & Mercy Adult Day Services, 
LLC. 

During her first year as an entrepreneur, 
she also gave birth to her first born, Mckenzie 
Janae Jackson on July 2, 2009. On September 
6, 2010 she gave birth to her 2nd 
born, Cayden Allen Jackson. They are outgoing, 
intelligent, inquisitive children. She also 
has a son, Alex Shaw, 17 years old, whom 
she adopted from a prior marriage. 

While working at Monette Hospice, the 
owner opened an Adult Daycare next door. 
Tamekia found herself drawn to the participants 
of this center. She also realized there 
was no such program at home for the elderly 
and disabled. She began to research adult 
daycare and sought information in the community 
regarding funding, transportation, and 
other services needed in Panola and the 8 
surrounding counties. In August of 2010, Dignity 
& Mercy Adult Day Services received a 
provider number for Adult Daycare in the state 
of MS. Later Dignity & Mercy also received a 
provider number for Respite and Homemaker 
Services. In January of 2014 Tamekia felt lead 
to open a facility in Oxford, MS. On July 1, 
2014 Dignity & Mercy received a contract for 
Non Emergency Transportation with Division 
of Medicaid via MTM. 

Dignity & Mercy is located at 569 Hwy 6 
West in Batesville, MS. Dignity & Mercy recently 
purchased and renovated a 13,000 sq. 
ft. facility located at 405 Hwy 51 south in 
Batesville, MS. The date for occupancy is set 
for Oct. 1, 2014. They are excited about the 
grace of God affording them such an opportunity. 


Dignity & Mercy services 50 to 60 clients 
per day at the Batesville location and 10 to 15 
clients at the Oxford location. Their participants 
range from 21 years of age to 99 and 
provide the transportation to and from the center 
along with breakfast, lunch and a snack 
before they leave. The participants attend 
movies monthly, visit schools and nursing 
homes. The Adult Day Care offers exercise 
class daily and other activities including shooting 
pool, reading, cooking, quilting, gardening, 
basketball, checkers, bowling, wii sports, ring 
toss, crocheting, coloring, and various arts and 
crafts. 

Dignity & Mercy has faced numerous challenges 
but God has delivered them from them 
all. When Tamekia is faced with struggles she 
takes comfort in the scripture from Jeremiah 

29:11 ‘‘For I know the thoughts that I think toward 
you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace 
and not of evil, to give you an expected end.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing Dignity & Mercy Adult Daycare 
Services for their dedication to serving their 
community and this great state and country.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 250TH AN


NIVERSARY OF THE NEW BRUNS


WICK FIRE DEPARTMENT 

HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the New Brunswick Fire Department 
as it celebrates its 250th anniversary this 

year. Since its formation, the New Brunswick 
Fire Department has upheld its duty to protect 
and serve the community. 

Organized in 1764, the New Brunswick Fire 
Department has seen many changes and 
much growth throughout its history. Its equipment 
has advanced as new technology became 
available, from buckets to various engines 
and wagons. During its first 100 years, 
more than ten companies were organized. 
Throughout the 1900s, 493 volunteered to 
serve in the department. On July 1, 1914, the 
New Brunswick Fire Department was officially 
installed as a paid department. 

Over its long history, a number of qualified 
leaders have served the New Brunswick Fire 
Department. Staasts Van Dursen was the first 
head of the department. James M. Carman 
served as the first Fire Director over 200 years 
later. Today, the New Brunswick Fire Department 
is led by a Director, five Deputy Chiefs, 
eight Captains, eight Lieutenants, fifty-six firefighters 
and a secretary and operates out of 
three companies and its headquarters. Seventy-
five percent of the force are also trained 
Emergency Medical Technicians and certified 
in defibrillation, a result of a requirement 
begun in 1989. 

Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope that my colleagues 
will join me in congratulating the New 
Brunswick Fire Department on this milestone. 
Its outstanding service is truly deserving of 
this body’s recognition.

TRIBUTE TO JOSH NELSON 

HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO 

OF WEST VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize 
the valiant effort of a friend and colleague, 
2nd Lt. Joshua ‘‘Josh’’ Nelson, West 
Virginia Air National Guard. I have come to 
know Josh through his service in the West Virginia 
Legislature, and feel that it is most fitting 
to acknowledge a recent good deed. 

Earlier this year, Josh stopped by his local 
Wal-Mart, near Laughlin Air Force Base, 
Texas, to pick up some fish hooks for a family 
trip. This small stop would soon turn out to be 
an experience that he will, likely, never forget. 

The following account is taken from the U.S. 
Air Force News, written by Joel Langton, 47th 
Flying Training Wing Public Affairs, published 
October 24, 2014: 

The West Virginia Air National Guardsman 
was walking to the Hunting and Fishing 
section when he heard a woman say, ‘‘Stop, 
put it down!’’ 

‘‘I could tell she was stressed and she 
sounded frightened,’’ said Nelson. ‘‘I looked 
into the aisle, and this young man had a 
knife to a woman’s stomach.’’ 

According to police reports, the young man 
was mad at his mother, who he had a knife 
to, because she wouldn’t buy him a gun. Nelson 
told his wife Brittany to go alert the 
store manager and call the police. 

Nelson, who has a concealed weapons permit 
stepped up beside the woman. 

‘‘I put my hand on my pistol where he’d 
notice, and then I stepped in between them,’’ 
said Nelson. ‘‘I kept demanding he hand me 
the knife. I wanted him to see only one option. 
As I was standing beside that lady, I 
felt like I was responsible for her life. I was 
going to do whatever I had to do to protect 
her.’’ 


E1518 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks November 12, 2014 

Then, according to the police report, Nelson 
went from trying to stop a murder to 
trying to stop a suicide when the assailant 
turned the knife on himself. 

Nelson pointed to his training and the Air 
National Guard and previously in the Marine 
Corp as helping him talk the young man 
down. 

By this time, several Wal-Mart employees 
had joined Nelson’s effort. ‘‘When he handed 
me the knife, he turned like he was going to 
just leave,’’ said Nelson. ‘‘We told him he 
needed to have a seat and wait for the police 
to arrive.’’ 

‘‘It was the most surreal five minutes of 
my life while waiting for the police,’’ said 
Nelson. He added that throughout the entire 
event, he was never scared. 

‘‘I just relied on all of the training I’ve 
had,’’ he said. 

This event was just another storied chapter 
in an almost Hollywoodesque life for Nelson. 
He’s gone from working in coal mines, 
to the Marine Corp, back to the mines, and 
today, when he’s not refining his flying 
skills, he serves in the West Virginia legislature 
as a delegate. 

The former Liberty University student 
body president points to his grandfather for 
his love of flying and the Founding Fathers 
for his passion to serve his nation and state 
. . . When Nelson graduates Oct. 24, he will 
be serving like the Founding Fathers never 
dreamed as he flies C–130s around the globe 
for the WVANG’s 130th Airlift Wing.’’ 

The first time I met Josh, I knew he was a 
smart, caring and capable young man. This is 
just one instance of Josh’s outstanding service 
to the citizens of this country, whether in uniform 
or civilian clothes. 

Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to recognize 
the heroism and selflessness exhibited 
by 2nd Lt. Joshua ‘‘Josh’’ Nelson, WVANG. 
He could have easily turned away, but he 
chose to become involved and save two lives, 
instead of one. I would also like to thank him 
for his service to the State of West Virginia 
and the United States of America. It is indeed 
an honor to call him friend and fellow West 
Virginian.

HONORING KIM BENNETT ON HER 
RETIREMENT 

HON. LUKE MESSER 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor 
my Director of Constituent Services, Kim Bennett, 
as she prepares to retire from her two 
decades of public service. 

Kim has served the State of Indiana and our 
country very capably throughout her career. 
She has headed our team’s constituent services 
operation since my election last year. Kim 
helped get our district offices up and running 
so that residents of Indiana’s Sixth Congressional 
District continued to receive the assistance 
they needed with the federal government, 
even during the congressional transition. 
I have heard from many of my constituents 
about how caring and professionally Kim has 
served them in matters involving a myriad of 
federal agencies. 

She worked for my predecessor in Congress, 
Governor Mike Pence, for more than a 
decade, serving in various roles, including 
Deputy District Director, Director of Grants, 
and Director of Economic and Rural Develop


ment. She also has coordinated the Sixth District 
Job Fair since 1997, an event which continues 
to this day. Kim also worked for Congressman 
David McIntosh as his Social Security 
caseworker from 1995 to 2001. Kim always 
went above and beyond in these various 
roles. She produced positive results to improve 
people’s lives in a caring and compassionate 
manner. 

Mr. Speaker, hiring Kim was one of the best 
decisions I made after my election to Congress. 
I learned very quickly that her stellar 
reputation among Hoosiers in the Sixth District 
was well-deserved after watching how diligently 
she worked on their behalf. I hope she 
knows how much she has meant to them and 
to me. I wish her and her husband, Robert, all 
the best as they embark on the next chapter 
of their lives.

HONORING THE STAFF OF 
MERRICK, INC. 

HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 

OF MINNESOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to the staff of Merrick Incorporated, 
past and present, on the occasion of its 50th 
anniversary. Since this private, non-profit organization 
was founded in 1964, it has served as 
a shining example of leadership and progressive 
commitment to advancing the quality of 
life of those with intellectual or developmental 
disabilities. 

Merrick Community Center first opened to 
serve fifteen young adults with intellectual and 
developmental disabilities to supplement the 

services provided by public schools. As the 
center grew in size, the volunteers and staff 
members recognized that these young adults 
had an interest in working and many skills to 
offer employers. Merrick Community Center 
began working tirelessly to partner with businesses 
and clients to provide valuable employment 
opportunities for these young adults. 

Since it was founded, Merrick Community 
Center and Daytime Activity Center has grown 
into a non-profit charitable corporation with 
two program sites. More than one hundred 
professional staff are dedicated to providing 
necessary support for over 375 adults with developmental 
and intellectual disabilities. As 
Merrick, Inc. has expanded, the community 
around them has also seen great advances 
and growth. Through day training and habilitation, 
adult day services and the Ticket-to-
Work program, young adults at Merrick, Inc.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE 
HONORABLE SUE LANDSKE 

HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 

OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with tremendous 
gratitude and the highest respect 
that I take this time to honor a dear friend and 
one of Indiana’s finest citizens, the Honorable 
Sue Landske, Indiana State Senator. During 
her many years of public service and because 
of her countless efforts toward improving the 
lives of her fellow Hoosiers, Sue has left an indelible 
mark as an outstanding public servant, 
and for this, she is to be commended. Senator 
Landske will be retiring at the end of this year. 

Sue Landske pursued her education at 
Saint Joseph’s College and Indiana University, 
followed by graduate studies at the University 
of Chicago. In the years to follow, Sue, 
through hard work and a spirit for public service, 
was elected Center Township Assessor in 
1978. She was also elected Lake County Republican 
Vice Chair the same year and maintained 
that position until 1989, then again from 
2001 to 2007. Senator Landske was first elected 
to the Indiana Legislature in 1984 and has 
selflessly represented the people of Indiana 
Senate District 6 for the last thirty years. 
Throughout her tenure as State Senator, Sue 
has consistently fought for the rights of the 
residents of her district and throughout Indiana. 
In particular, Senator Landske’s legislative 
achievements include authoring Indiana’s 
lemon law, which guards Hoosiers against the 
sale of defective vehicles, creating living will 
legislation, which gives Indiana residents better 
control over their future medical decisions, 
and spearheading the passage of a bill requiring 
all Indiana nursing homes to have fire

sprinklers throughout their facilities and smoke 
detectors in every patient’s room. Senator 
Landske’s record speaks for itself. She has 
passionately devoted herself to improving the 
lives of Hoosiers and to protecting the interests 
and well-being of Indiana’s most vulnerable 
citizens. Highlighting her leadership in 
Northwest Indiana and the Indiana General 
Assembly, Sue has distinguished herself by 
serving as the Assistant Pro Tempore in the 
Indiana State Senate. She has also served on 
numerous legislative committees including the 
Tax and Fiscal Policy Committee, as a ranking 
member of the Civil Law Committee, and as 
chair of the Elections Committee. Along with 
her career as a State Senator, Sue is also a 
retired colonel in the Indiana National Guard 
and president and owner of All Golfcar, Incorporated. 


Senator Landske’s exemplary service has 
been rightfully recognized numerous times 
during her legislative career. In both 1980 and 
1983, she was honored with the prestigious 
Sagamore of the Wabash for her service to 
the people of Indiana. Following this honor, 
Sue was awarded the title of Outstanding Republican 
Senator, as well as the accolade of 
Business and Professional Woman of the 
Year. Sue was also recognized as Lake County 
Republican of the Year in 1988, the Jaycees’ 
Citizen of the Year in 1991, and was 
named Small Business Champion in 2000 by 
the National Federation of Independent Business. 


Senator Landske’s remarkable career is exceeded 
only by her devotion to her amazing 
family. Sue and her loving husband of fifty-
seven years, Bill, have five children and seven 
grandchildren. 

I have been truly fortunate to call Sue 
Landske my friend. Throughout the years, she 
has been an outstanding advocate for the 
community of Northwest Indiana, as well as 
for all Hoosiers. She epitomizes what it means 
to be a public servant, and for her selfless, 
lifelong commitment to the people of Indiana, 
she is worthy of the highest praise. 

Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and 
my other distinguished colleagues join me in 
honoring Indiana State Senator Sue Landske 
for her lifetime of leadership and exceptional 
service to the people of Northwest Indiana and 
throughout the state. Senator Landske’s impact 
will be evident for generations to come, 
and she serves as an inspiration to us all.

IN RECOGNITION OF ROBERT 
HUGHES 

HON. MARC A. VEASEY 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Robert Hughes, a man who 
broke incredible records in basketball while simultaneously 
overcoming tremendous obstacles. 
Robert Hughes paved the way for African 
American students to have the same opportunities 
as their counterparts and bridged the divides 
of a segregated community. 

Robert Hughes was born on May 15, 1928, 
in Sapulpa, Oklahoma. He was the youngest 
of five brothers with a successful high school 
basketball career. After a tour in the U.S. 
Army during the Korean War, Hughes played 

college basketball at Texas Southern University. 
In 1955, he was drafted to the Boston 
Celtics, but ended up playing for Marques 
Haynes’ barnstorming team, the Harlem Magicians. 
During his time with the Harlem Magicians, 
he ruptured his Achilles tendon and 
began his legendary coaching career. 

From 1958 to 1973, Hughes coached the 
Fort Worth I.M. Terrell High School basketball 
team, with an astonishing record of 378–84. 
During this time, I.M. Terrell was a segregated 
high school, placing the team in a specific division 
called the Prairie View Interscholastic 
League. The PVIL governed the Texas African 
American high schools. Hughes won three 
PVIL championships and came second in two 
more during his time at Terrell. In 1973, the 
desegregation of public schools would lead to 
the closing of Terrell and the beginning of 
Hughes career at Fort Worth Dunbar High 
School. 

Hughes remained at Fort Worth Dunbar until 
he retired in 2005 with an astonishing overall 
career record of 1,333–264. He had the most 
wins in the entire nation until recently when 
Leta Andrews passed his record. During his 
47 seasons at Dunbar, Hughes brought his 
team to victory while changing the lives of 
thousands of students. As a coach, he broke 
the racial divide and bridged the gap between 
communities. For 50 years, the Southwest 
Conference denied entry to black high school 
athletes. Hughes navigated his way around 
these policies and created relationships with 
the Big Ten, Pacific 8 and Missouri Valley 
Conferences so that all of his players could be 
offered the same opportunities. 

Dallas cinematographer, Ronald Nance and 
Lindell Singleton, producer of major feature 
films such as Lone Star and Holy War, are 
partnering to bring Robert Hughes’ story to life 
in a feature-length documentary called Relentless, 
which will premiere in February 2015. 
The film will capture the incredible feats of 
Hughes and the impact that he had on the 
Texas basketball community. 

In honor of Coach Robert Hughes, a pillar of 
the Fort Worth and Texas athletic community, 
this statement will be entered into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD on Wednesday, November 
12, 2014.

HONORING DR. GERALDINE B. 
CHANEY 

HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 

OF MISSISSIPPI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor a remarkable public 
servant, Dr. Geraldine B. Chaney, M.D., who 
is a native of Mississippi. She was born into 
a family of nine children (six girls and three 
boys), with parents who stressed the importance 
of strong religious beliefs. Dr. Chaney’s 
parents were not formally educated, but possessed 
a wealth of knowledge. They taught 
God first, family and education next. 

Dr. Chaney chose to attend Tougaloo College 
and major in Biology and Chemistry. As 
tradition would have it, Dr. Chaney’s brothers 
and sisters who had gone to college before 
her, went to school to become school teachers. 
All of that changed when she heard some 
of her classmates talking about going to med


ical school. At that moment without telling anyone, 
Dr. Chaney closeted in her mind that she 
wanted to become a physician. She thought 
that her idea was a bit farfetched. She had 
never seen or known a black or white female 
physician. 

However, Tougaloo offered unique experience. 
Dr. Chaney excelled in her studies and 
took the exam for entry into medical school. 
Her score was good enough to get her into 
her choice of four schools. She chose the University 
of Mississippi, because she wanted to 
practice in Mississippi. 

Dr. Chaney entered medical school with 
only five other African Americans. There were 
five black males, and she was the only black 
female. It was a very grueling experience, but 
they all managed to finish. Dr. Chaney admits 
that she did better in medical school than in 
college. Probably because she really wanted 
to be a doctor. It was also important to her 
that the medical community get to know her 
and see what she was capable of doing. 

When Dr. Chaney completed her residency 
in 1977, there was only one other black pediatrician 
in the Jackson area. She knew that she 
couldn’t start a private practice right out of 
school, because she would be swamped by 
those looking for a black physician to care for 
their children. So, she spent the first ten years 
working at the clinic, the University Medical 
Center, with another physician, and volunteering. 
She also worked part-time in public 
health and consulting. 

Dr. Chaney is one of the most prominent 
pediatricians in the state of Mississippi, serving 
patients of all races and nationalities. 

Dr. Chaney is quick to point out that her 
husband played a huge part in her success. 
She left her salaried position at the Health 
Center to start her own business, and he 
stood with her 100%. When she began the 
practice, her earnings were only half of what 
she had made from the clinic and consulting. 
But, she knew that was only temporary. In her 
own words, ‘‘To build a business, there has to 
be some sacrifice.’’ She and her family decided 
that they could make the sacrifice. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing Dr Geraldine B. Chaney for her 
dedication to serving others.

The Elmore Company, Stephen H. Elmore 
Company, Desert Sky Farms and Echo II.

her 95th birthday this year. I would like to join

I join with all those who know her in expressing 
my sincere gratitude for her warm and giving 
nature and immeasurable contributions to

HONORING MR. JOHN P. SINDONI 

HON. JAMES P. MORAN 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor my good friend and fellow Holy Cross 
alumnus, Mr. John P. Sindoni, Esq., class of 
1967. John has served with distinction as a 
highly effective class chair and co-chair of the 
Holy Cross Alumni Association since graduation. 


Through his dedicated efforts, he has kept 
his classmates informed, energized and sup


portive of the Holy Cross mission. He has 
maintained a strong bond with the College for 
47 years since graduation. Since 1967, his engaging 
and informative class letters to his fellow 
Crusaders has added to the cohesiveness 
of our class. 

The esprit de corps John has sustained 
among his classmates and the strong ties he 
has helped them to maintain with their Alma 
Mater have led to record levels of participation 
in annual giving to the Holy Cross Fund from 
the Class of 1967. Thanks to his work, a majority 
of our classmates have donated generously 
for the past thirty years. During reunion 
years, that number hovers closer to 70 percent. 


John has also been a driving force in the 
Holy Cross Club of Central New York and a 
leader among a core group of dedicated alumni 
in the Syracuse area. A frequent organizer, 
sponsor and host of alumni activities in his 
hometown, John is a prominent alumnus 
whose dedication to the College is widely 
known. John has mentored many young Holy 
Cross graduates over the years and has fostered 
interest in Holy Cross among students at 
the Christian Brothers Academy in Syracuse, 
where his decades of work has earned him 
recognition for distinguished service. 

After college, John graduated from Cornell 
University Law School and is now a partner in 
the law firm Hiscock & Barclay, LLP He and 
his lovely wife, Cecilia, live in Cicero, NY, and 
have six children, including Laura, Holy Cross 
Class of 2005. 

Mr. Speaker, John deserves the recognition 
of this body for a job well done. His years of 
service have made our class, college, and our 
country ever more deserving of our respect 
and our pride.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
BROTHERHOOD OF 
ELECTRICAL WORKERS LOCAL 
UNION 375 

HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor the 100th anniversary of the International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers 
Local Union 375 and to acknowledge their 
persistent endeavor to fairly represent their 
members. 

On February 3, 1914, a dedicated group of 
seventeen electricians organized into the 
Local Union 375. Their goal was to obtain better 
wages and better working conditions. In 
1947, LU 375 initiated an apprenticeship program. 
Now seen as a key function, the apprenticeship 
program meets the demand for 
high quality electricians highly skilled in fiber-
optics and advanced technologies as well as 
the traditional delivery modes. That same 
year, LU 375 joined the National Electrical 
Contractors Association, which leveraged their 
bargaining power. The benefits afforded members 
increased again in 1961, when the Health 
and Welfare Plan was put in place to provide 
healthcare and other benefits. Another milestone 
was reached on June 1, 1990, when LU 
375 began to train Telecommunication Technicians 
as part of the Telephone Interconnect 
Communications system agreement. 

On December 19, 1998, LU 375 moved to 
their new office and training center at what is 
now their current headquarters in Allentown. A 
short eleven years later, in 2009, they hired 
their first full-time Training Director and expanded 
the apprenticeship program. Today, 
they serve up to 150 apprentices in their training 
center and offer programs to keep veteran 
members current on the newest techniques 
and technologies. Although hit by the economic 
downturn in 2008, they have since seen 
new opportunities, including those generated 
by the redevelopment of downtown Allentown 
through the Neighborhood Improvement Zone 
awarded in 2013. 

As one of the oldest unions in the region, 
LU 375 has grown to a membership approaching 
1100, with ranks continuing to expand 
thanks to well-planned organizing. After 100 
years, the IBEW Local Union 375 has remained 
true to their mission to provide strong, 
fair representation and open communication 
for members, fellow unions, contractors, and 
the community. It is an honor for me to recognize 
their 100 years of service and fraternity.

HONORING MR. EUGENE HICKS 

HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 

OF MISSISSIPPI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor a remarkable Entrepreneur 
of Clarksdale, Mound Bayou, Mississippi. 


Clarksdale business owner, Eugene Hicks, 
Sr., continues to receive recognition for his 
world famous hot tamales. He has been featured 
on the Food Networks television show, 
Rachel Ray’s, Chile Pepper, Southern Living, 
Esquire magazines and other national magazines. 
He has also been featured in the local 
and national newspapers. 

Mr. Hicks has hosted and served quite a 
few famous people and celebrities from the 
late, John F. Kennedy Jr., and John Amos, 
Blues entertainers, Bobbie Rush, Rufus Thomas, 
Tyrone Davis, and many worldwide tourist 
travelers. The most exciting historical event 
hosting and serving President Bill Clinton, 
Rev. Jessie Jackson, and several Mississippi 
governors including Governor Ray Mabus, 
Governor Ronnie Musgrove, and Governor 
Haley Barbour, and many more distinguished 
customers. 

Mr. Hicks, who is now 70 years old, has 
been making tamales since age 16 when he 
was introduced to the cooking craft by the late 
Angelo Thompson who was the owner of Liberty 
Super Market in Clarksdale. Mr. Thompson 
instructed him on how to properly cut 
meat and how to manage a store and a restaurant. 
Mr. Hicks started working at the Liberty 
Super Market at the age of 12 years. He 
would work after school and worked at local 
stores doing various types jobs. 

During the same time around the age of 12, 
an older black gentleman named Acy Ware 
befriended him. Mr. Ware made and sold 
tamales to the public by push cart and Mr. 
Hicks would go back and forth to the local grocery 
stores on his bike to pick up the different 
spices and shucks that Mr. Ware needed to 
make his tamales. A couple of years later, Mr. 
Ware taught Mr. Hicks how to make tamales 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1521 

and informed him that the skill of making 
tamales can assist in him becoming an entrepreneur. 


Mr. Hicks was drafted into the military at the 
age of 21 and worked in the mess hall preparing 
and cooking for the officers and his fellow 
soldiers. His ability to cook afforded him 
the opportunity to stay state side and be 
shipped off to Vietnam. After his military service 
he went back to work at Liberty Super 
Market, and at the federal building before 
opening his own grocery store. He opened 
Hicks’ Superette in 1973, on 109–5th Street at 
the age of 26 with $52 dollars where he sold 
groceries and his tamales. 

Business was booming and people from all 
over the world came to eat his tamales. Customers 
liked his tamales and the word spread 
that he had the best tamales in the Mississippi 
Delta and they would request orders to be 
shipped to them in various parts of the United 
States and foreign countries. 

‘‘The mid–90s were really tough,’’ Hicks 
said. However, he had to close down Hicks’ 
Superette. In 2000 because of high crime and 
drug usage in that area of down town, people 
began to move out. 

Mr. Hicks moved and opened a restaurant/ 
banquet hall, called Hicks’ World Famous Hot 
Tamales & More on 305 South State Street. 
He has independently own his business for 41 
years now. Hicks is one of the oldest independent 
black business in Clarksdale. 

Mr. Hicks is amazed that these years his 
business still attracts people from all over the 
world. 

So, what is the secret to Mr. Hick’s success? 
It is the shucks he uses to wrap the 
tamales in before cooking. Many people use 
wax paper which is cheaper. It’s kind of expensive 
the way he does it, but it is the way 
he was taught 50 years ago and it has paid 
off. He does not believe in cutting comers like 
most people may. 

His wife, Betty, of 44 years has worked in 
the business for the last 11 years after retiring 
from the Clarksdale Public School System. 
She said, ‘‘Eugene has recently contemplated 
retirement.’’ 

Mr. Hicks stated that his career has been a 
blessed one, because he has had a chance to 
meet a lot of people due to his tamales. Mr. 
Hicks lives by the motto of: ‘‘What you do—do 
it well.’’ 

Mr. Hicks and his wife are the proud parents 
of 3 children. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing an amazing entrepreneur for his 
dedication and service to his profession.

RECOGNIZING BOBBY’S 
PLAYGROUND 

HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, on October 
18, 2014 a community in my district teamed 
up to show that together we can overcome 
heartbreak. 

Over 100 volunteers, local businesses and 
community leaders worked to complete Bobby’s 
Playground—a new park area at the 
Lower Bucks Family YMCA’s Holland Campground. 
The playground is named in honor of 
Robert Edward Osterhout IV of Holland who 
tragically passed away at just 14 months. 

The project, a Kaboom Playground, was 
completed by the hands of volunteers who 
dedicated their time and talents to remember 
the life of Bobby and ensure that generations 
of kids to come would have a safe place to 
play, laugh and learn. 

It was a pleasure to participate in the event 
and offer a few words about the amazing work 
being done in my district by those I represent. 

While Bobby’s passing is a tragedy, the 
completion of this playground serves both as 
a reminder of his memory and a point of community 
pride.

Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my good friend, His Excellency 
Nguyen Quoc Cuong, Ambassador Extraordinary

Vietnam’s missions abroad, as Minister Counselor, 
Deputy Chief of Mission at the Embassy 
of Vietnam in Ottawa, Canada from 2002 to 
2005 and as Second Secretary at the Embassy 
of Vietnam in Beijing, the People’s Republic 
of China from 1990 to 1993. 

Ambassador Nguyen Quoc Cuong graduated 
from the University of Foreign Affairs, 
Vietnam (1976–1981) and earned an MA in 
International Relations at Fletcher School of 
Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, USA 
(1996–1997). Ambassador Nguyen Quoc 
Cuong also conducted studies on public administration 
at the Maxwell School of Public 
Administration, Syracuse University in 1998. 
He also participated in the Vietnam Executive 
Leadership Program at the Kennedy School of 
Government, Harvard University in 2009. 

On November 7, 2014, the U.S. Department 
of State honored Ambassador Nguyen Quoc 
Cuong by hosting a farewell reception for him 


E1522 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks November 12, 2014 

at Blair House, the President’s Guest House 
which serves as a site for American diplomacy 
in action. Blair House is the official state guest 
house for the President of the United States 
and is maintained by the Department of State. 
An invitation to be hosted at Blair House is an 
honor of the highest significance. Ambassador 
Nguyen Quoc Cuong is the first Ambassador 
from Vietnam to be honored with a farewell reception 
at the Blair House and this speaks to 
the significance of his work for and on behalf 
of strengthening U.S.-Vietnam relations. 

As Ranking Member of the House Foreign 
Affairs’ Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, 
it has been my distinct privilege to work side 
by side with Ambassador Nguyen Quoc 
Cuong. Together, we created the first Friends 
of Vietnam Caucus in the U.S. Congress, and 
I have every hope that it will grow in importance. 
We have also worked to improve economic 
and trade relations and I am pleased 
that during Ambassador Nguyen Quoc 
Cuong’s service in the United States, the U.S. 
and Vietnam celebrated 20 years of trade relations. 


I commend Vietnam’s leadership on the 
matter of maritime territorial and Exclusive 
Economic Zone (EEZ) disputes in the South 
and East China Seas. Vietnam has demonstrated 
restraint and strength in dealing with 
China by adopting a strategy that promotes 
peace and stability in the region and, going 
forward, I have every reason to believe that 
Vietnam’s influence in the region will be pivotal 
in resolving further disputes. 

On a personal note, I want to publicly thank 
Ambassador Nguyen Quoc Cuong for all he 
did on behalf of The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, of which I am a member. 
For as long as I live, I will never be able to 
thank Ambassador Nguyen Quoc Cuong for 
giving his all to bring about recognition of the 
interim representative committee of The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 
Vietnam. 

For their love, support and prayers, I especially 
express my deepest gratitude to Ambassador 
Nguyen Quoc Cuong and his very talented 
and beautiful wife, Madam Hoang Minh 
Ha. When I was ill, they prayed over me and 
when I returned to work they stood beside me. 
They are more than friends. They are family to 
me, and I hope I am family to them. 

We have walked together with faith in every 
footstep and it is only fitting that I conclude my 
service in Washington, D.C. at the same time 
Ambassador Nguyen Quoc Cuong and 
Madam Ha conclude their service. I wish for 
the Ambassador and his wife life’s sweetest 
blessings. I wish the same for the Ambassador’s 
daughter and son—Nguyen Huong Chi 
and Nguyen Quoc Anh—and Madam Ha’s 
niece Mai Hoang Anh. I pray God will be with 
them, until we meet again.

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, 
on Monday, November 3, 2014, funeral 
services for Bobby Earl (Robin) Hudson, Jr., 
were held at Lexington Baptist Church, in Lex


ington, South Carolina. Mr. Hudson, 60, was 
the founder and owner of Hudson’s Smokehouse 
in Lexington, South Carolina, and is remembered 
as a kind and generous gentleman 
of character who dedicated himself to supporting 
the local civic groups and his fellow 
citizens. 

His obituary in The Lexington County 
Chronicle of Lexington, South Carolina, contained 
this tribute: 

BOBBY EARL (ROBIN) HUDSON, JR. 

LEXINGTON.—Robin Hudson, age 60, died on 
Thursday, October 30, 2014. Born August 16, 
1954 in San Marcos, Texas, Robin was the son 
of Bobby Earl (Bob) Hudson and Stella H. 
Kyzer. He moved back to South Carolina in 
1958. Robin graduated from Airport High 
School in 1972 and attended Massey Fashion 
Institute in Atlanta, Georgia. Shortly thereafter 
Robin moved to Clemson, South Carolina, 
and opened up a successful Foosball 
Parlor/Bar Business. This would prove to be 
his initial first step into business ownership. 
From there he went to work for Explorer 
Van Sales, where he served as the Southeastern 
Sales Representative. After many 
successful years with Explorer he went on to 
open his own Van Business in Columbia, 
which was known as Buddy Baker Boat and 
Van World. He later joined his brothers, Darrell 
and Chuck, opening up Hudson Brothers 
Truck Accessory Center where he headed up 
the Truck Accessory Department. Along the 
way he began cooking BBQ using the recipe 
from his family heritage back in Warsaw, 
North Carolina. He began catering on the 
side and eventually bought a trailer and did 
mobile catering. From then he went on to 
open what we all know and love today, Hudson’s 
Smokehouse in 2002, with the help of 
his wife, Barbara and sons, Clint and Clay. 
Robin was a creative genius in marketing 
and he made Hudson’s Smokehouse what it 
is today. He is known for his dependability, 
his enormous heart and strong work ethic. 
Robin worked tireless, endless hours to serve 
the community with whatever need they 
had. It was truly his heart’s desire to serve 
others. 

In addition to his successful restaurant 
business, he was a beloved son, admired 
brother, loving husband and devoted father. 
Robin is survived by his wife, Barbara Kice 
Hudson, and 4 children, Clinton Garrett Hudson, 
Clayton Windham Hudson, Jessica 
Lauren Brown Hudson and Cody Arthur Hudson; 
father, Bobby Earl (Bob) Hudson and his 
wife Laura Slade Hudson; mother, Stella H. 
Kyzer; brothers, Darrell Craig Hudson and 
his wife, Gay Jewell Hudson, Charles Alan 
Hudson and his wife, Cindy Momand Hudson; 
sister, Melinda Hudson Dailey and her husband 
Gregory Scott Dailey. Robin is also 
survived by many aunts, uncles, cousins, 
nieces, nephews and many, many dear 
friends who will all miss him terribly. 

A Drop-in Celebration was held at 5 p.m., 
Sunday, November 2, 2014 at Hudson’s 
Smokehouse, 4948 Sunset Blvd., Lexington, 
SC. A memorial service was held at noon on

ANTHONY F. WIENERS 

HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Anthony Wieners’ leadership and 
dedication to the law enforcement community 
and the citizens of New Jersey. To honor his 
years of commitment, his friends, family, and 
colleagues joined together in October to celebrate 
his amazing career. 

Anthony F. Wieners is a life-long resident of 
Belleville, New Jersey. A veteran of the United 
States Navy, Anthony began his law enforcement 
career in January of 1980 as a patrolman 
with the East Orange Police Department, 
transferring to the Belleville Police Department 
in September of 1980, where he held the position 
of Detective until his retirement in July 
2014. In 1991, Anthony was elected State Delegate 
of Belleville Police Benevolent Association 
(PBA), a position he held until his retirement. 
Anthony also held the offices of Belleville 
PBA Local President and Vice President. 
In addition to holding local offices, Anthony is 
a past chairman and co-chairman of the Essex 
County PBA Conference. 

Anthony was appointed to the New Jersey 
State PBA Executive Board in 1993 and on 
May 1, 1997, he was appointed to the position 
of Executive Vice President. In 2007, Anthony 
was elected State President of the New Jersey 
PBA with a membership of over 33,000 
officers. Anthony served as PBA President 
with distinction until earlier this year when he 
stepped down to allow for new leadership. 

As PBA President, Anthony instituted many 
new programs within the organization including 
the NJ PBA COP SHOT program that provides 
automatic reward money whenever any 
NJ law enforcement officer is killed or wounded 
in the line of duty. On the national level, 
Anthony was a Vice President of the National 
Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), 
which represents over 254,000 law enforcement 
officers from more than 4,000 organizations 
throughout the United States. Anthony 
has also been involved in the Police Unity 
Bike Tour for many years. In 1998, 2006 and 
2014, he participated in rides from NJ to 
Washington, DC and helped raise over $2 million 
in funds for the National Law Enforcement 
Officers Memorial Fund. 

As Co-Chair of the Congressional Law Enforcement 
Caucus, I was proud to have Anthony 
as a partner on many efforts including 
our fight to protect the COPS program from 
budget cuts that would have decimated the 
program. 

Anthony holds memberships in many organizations, 
including the NJ Police Honor Legion, 
the Belleville Kiwanis Club, the Asian 
American Law Enforcement Advisory Committee, 
and the Knights of Columbus in Belleville. 


Anthony is married to Julia, and they have 
two children, Michael and Kaitlin. 

The job of a United States Congressman involves 
much that is rewarding, yet nothing 
compares to recognizing and commemorating 
the services of individuals like Mr. Anthony F. 
Wieners. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, 
Mr. Wieners’ family, friends, and all 
those whose lives he has touched, and me, in

TRIBUTE TO ED WALKER AND 
‘‘THE BIG BROADCAST’’ 

HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN 

OF MARYLAND 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I am honored 
to rise today to congratulate WAMU 
88.5’s ‘‘The Big Broadcast’’ on its 50th anniversary 
and to celebrate the extraordinary accomplishments 
and career of my constituent, 
Ed Walker, one of the most respected radio 
broadcasters in generations. Mr. Walker’s distinguished 
career spans over 50 years as a 
broadcaster, most recently as the outstanding 
host since 1990 of The Big Broadcast. 

Through The Big Broadcast, Mr. Walker has 
kept alive and shared with new generations 
the classic radio shows of a bygone era— 
shows like ‘‘The Lone Ranger,’’ ‘‘Gunsmoke’’ 
and ‘‘Fibber McGee.’’ The art form in these 
broadcasts was magnificent, of the highest 
quality, and truly innovative. In addition to entertaining 
us, they served a unique role in 
American society by uniting us with imagery 
that one finds only in radio, featuring the great 
writing and talent of the performers, and sharing 
unique perspectives. Families would crowd 
around the radio listening for the latest episodes 
and waiting to learn of the latest heroics 
or antics of their favorite characters. In the Big 
Broadcast, Mr. Walker not only brought all of 
this extraordinary material to us week after 
week, but put it in context and served as our 
tour guide through decades of American history 
as portrayed through the wonderful radio 
broadcasts. 

Mr. Walker was appropriately recognized in 
2009 by the Radio Hall of Fame for his lifetime 
of achievements, placed alongside the greats 
that include Bob Hope and Abbott & Costello. 
I am pleased and honored to represent him in 
the U.S. House of Representatives. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. 
Walker on his distinguished contributions to 
radio and to our cultural heritage.

HONORING MR. TIMOTHY CRUDUP 

HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 

OF MISSISSIPPI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor a remarkable veteran 
and community servant, Mr. Timothy Crudup. 
Mr. Crudup has shown what can be done 
through hand work, setting goals, and aiming 
high. 

Timothy Crudup, the fourth child of Mr. 
Jonas Crudup and Mrs. Tommie Lyles 
Crudup, was born in Scott County, Forest, 
Mississippi. He lived in Forest all of his childhood 
and young adult life, where he attended 
elementary school and the ninth and tenth 
grades of high school. While in high school, 
he was drafted in 1943, to serve in the United 
States Navy, during WWII. After his tour of 
duty, Mr. Crudup received an honorable discharge 
from the United States Navy in January 
1946. 

In the fall of 1946, having a desire to complete 
his high school education, he enrolled in 
the Alcorn Laboratory High School in Lorman, 
MS. With an interest in furthering his education, 
after graduating from high school, he 
enrolled in Alcorn College, with a major in 
education. Later, he received the Master’s degree 
from Jackson State University in Administration 
and Supervision. 

In 1952, Mr. Crudup began his teaching career 
in the Madison County School System 
and remained with this school system until his 
retirement in 1985. His first position was as a 
high school teacher at the Farmhaven High 
School in Farmhaven, MS. After teaching for 
one year, his leadership abilities were recognized, 
and he was offered the position of principal 
of that school. Later the school was relocated 
to a new school building with the name 
changed to Luther Branson. He continued to 
serve as principal in that community for 14 
years. Then he was asked to accept the principal 
position at Rosa Scott High School, in 
Madison, MS, where he served in that position 
for 19 years, retiring in 1985. 

He married his college sweetheart, Miss 
Annie Camille Jefferson of Yazoo City, Mississippi. 
They have one child, Linda Crudup 
Gladney, and one grandchild, Brian Timothy 
Gladney. 

Although Mr. Crudup’s career as an educator 
was in the Madison County School System, 
he and his wife made their home in 
Yazoo City, Mississippi. He was active in both 
communities. Upon his retirement, he was recognized 
by the Madison Ridgeland branch of 
the NAACP for his dedicated service in the 
field of education and his pivotal role in school 
desegregation in Mississippi, specifically, in 
Madison County. Also, he was recognized by 
Rosa Scott Parent/Teacher Association for his 
leadership and unceasing efforts to provide 
quality education for all students of Madison 
County Schools. 

A strong spiritual foundation has always 
been central in Mr. Crudup’s personal and 
family life. He has been very active in Mt. 
Vernon Missionary Baptist Church where he 
served as Deacon, Superintendent of the Sunday 
School and Church Treasurer. He dedicated 
much of his time in service through his 
church, in whatever capacity needed. The 
church formally recognized his many years of 
service in 2005. 

In the Yazoo City community, he served on 
the Board of Trustees for the King’s Daughter’s 
Hospital from October, 2002 through 
March, 2005. Other organizations he was affiliated 
with are: Masons, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, 
Inc., Phi Delta Kappa, Yazoo County 
Alcorn Alumni Club, American Legion, the 
Yazoo County Fair and Civic League, Inc. On 
March 26, 2006, the Lieutenant Governor of 
the State of Mississippi and Senator Joseph 
Thomas, commended the civic and charitable 
accomplishments of Mr. Crudup and designated 
that day as ‘‘Timothy Crudup Day’’ in 
Yazoo City, Mississippi. 

Mr. Crudup has been a role model to many 
and is spoken highly of by so many citizens of 
various segments of the community. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing Mr. Timothy Crudup for his 
dedication to serving our great Country and 
his community.

health care field are truly deserving of this

TRIBUTE TO FRIENDS OF KENNA 

OUTDOOR LEARNING ENVIRON


MENT/PLAYGROUND 

HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO 

OF WEST VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
commend the citizens of Jackson County, and 
the Friends of Kenna on an exciting community 
development project that has taken place 
in my district. Kenna Elementary School is the 
first new school construction in the county in 
40 years. The unincorporated community of 
Kenna, illustrates what is best about America 
and the State of West Virginia. It is a rural 
area that believes in hard work and helping 
ones’ neighbor. The geography of the area 
physically separates its residents, but that 
does not deter it from making an extra effort 
at creating community. That’s why I think it is 


E1524 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks November 12, 2014 

important to recognize the work of the Friends 
of Kenna, a group of residents, whose work 
has resulted in a state-of-the-art outdoor learning 
environment, playground and walking track 
in Jackson County, as a part of the new 
Kenna Elementary School. The new school 
playground and track is available for all of the 
residents of Jackson County to use and 
should serve as a shining example of the importance 
of fitness and health. I would like to 
applaud all of those who rallied together to 
bring about this substantive change. 

I would like to recognize The Friends of 
Kenna Association and local residents who 
are responsible for this extremely worthy 
project. Special recognition for the effort behind 
the project should go to Kerynn Sovic, 
Sonya White, Deanna Cunningham, Jessie 
Cox, Jessie Thompson, and Melissa 
Donelson. I would also like to salute the following:

HONORING LAUREN HILL 

HON. LUKE MESSER 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Lauren Hill for her athletic accomplishments 
and continued strength in her fight 
against Pediatric Brain Cancer. 

Last year, Lauren was diagnosed with Diffuse 
Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, an incurable 
form of Brain Cancer. The disease has made 
it increasingly difficult for Lauren to fulfill her 
dream of playing college basketball. Yet, this 
college freshman at Mount St. Joseph University 
persevered and scored four points in her 
college debut earlier this month to help her 
team defeat Hiram College. Lauren was 
named Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference 
Women’s Basketball Player of the 
Week for her performance. 

Lauren is a remarkable young woman, not 
just because of her athletic ability, but for her 
passion and dedication to live her life to the 
fullest while raising awareness about Pediatric 
Brain Cancer. Her grace and dignity has been 
a source of strength for children and families 
facing this terrible disease. Lauren has chosen 
to donate all proceeds from the basketball 
game to The Cure Starts Now, an organization 
working to find a cure for Pediatric Brain Cancer. 
Though Lauren’s story has made national 
headlines, she has remained the same humble 
and tenacious young woman whose story 
has inspired our nation. 

During the game against Hiram, Lauren said 
‘‘I’ve never felt so good in my entire life. Let’s 
not call it my last game. This is my first collegiate 
game.’’ This positive attitude should 
serve as a reminder about what we can accomplish 
even against the most insurmountable 
odds. 

I ask the entire 6th Congressional District to 
join me in honoring this outstanding young 
woman for the way she has lived her life and 
the courage with which she has bravely fought 
this disease.

MARGIE SEMLER 

HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Margie Semler’s leadership and 
dedication to the community of Passaic and 
the citizens of New Jersey. To honor her 
years of commitment, her friends, family, and 
colleagues joined together in October to celebrate 
her amazing career. 

Margie Semler, daughter of Max and Riva 
Orlin, a life-long resident of Passaic, New Jersey, 
was born on June 22, 1923. In 1941, she 
moved to Passaic with her husband Mac and 
for the next eleven years began her career in 
government, where she took a part-time job at 
a junkyard run by the city’s public works department. 


While raising and tending to her two young 
children along with her fun loving, good natured 
husband Mac, she decided to run for a 
seat on the Passaic Board of Education. For 
the next 6 years while on the Board of Education 
she began her illustrious career as a 
public servant in which she earned the respect 
of the residents in the City of Passaic. 

Margie decided to further her career and 
passion for serving the people of Passaic. For 
the next sixteen years, she was able to serve 
the residents while on the Passaic City Coun


cil. Her passion to being a public servant 
drove her ambitions when she was elected as 
the Mayor of the City of Passaic in 1993. She 
became the first and only female mayor to 
serve for eight years during her term from 
1993–2001. 
In 2005, Margie was indicted into the New 
Jersey Elected Officials Hall of Fame. She has 
been and remains to be a vital asset to the 
City of Passaic. Margie is an active participant 
in various public and civic organizations. She 
has a great love for animals and an even 
greater affection for the city in which she has 
called her home for nearly her entire life. 

Margie continues to serve on the Board of 
Directors of the Passaic Head Start and remains 
an avid supporter of the families and 
children in the City of Passaic. As a result of 
her tireless dedication and commitment to the 
people of Passaic, the staff, policy council, 
and the Board of Directors of the Passaic 
Head Start have renamed their building to the 
Margie Semler Education Center in her honor. 

Margie is married to the late Mac Semler 
and have two children, Lorrie and Marc. 

The job of a United States Congressman involves 
much that is rewarding, yet nothing 
compares to recognizing and commemorating 
the services of individuals like Ms. Semler. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, 
Ms. Semler’s family, friends, and all 
those whose lives she has touched, and me, 
in recognizing Margie Semler for her dedication 
to her family and her nation.

THANKING PATRICK MILLIGAN 

HON. PAUL COOK 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay 
tribute to a retiring leader of the San 
Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District, 
Patrick Milligan. Patrick Milligan was born in 
San Bernardino in 1937. His family started 
one of the original citrus farms in Rialto. He 
fondly recalls memories of growing up in Rialto 
during a time when he and his friends 
could walk through vacant land shooting bb 
guns. In 1955, he graduated with honors from 
San Bernardino High School and later graduated 
from Stanford University and Stanford 
Law. He returned to his hometown and began 
practicing trial law in 1961, starting a law firm 
in San Bernardino where he continues to practice 
law. Pat is married to Jean Miller Milligan 
and has four children, two of whom have followed 
in his footsteps as attorneys. 

In 1964, at the age of 28, Pat was elected 
to the Board of Directors for the San 
Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District 
(Valley District). He has served on the Board 
for over 41 years and has served as President 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1525 

of the Board for 19 of those years, almost half 
of his tenure. When Pat was elected, Valley 
District was only 10 years old. So, Pat has 
been involved in building this new agency 
from the ground up. He ‘‘hit the ground running’’ 
helping Valley District settle two lawsuits 
with Orange County Water District and Western 
Municipal Water District, respectively. The 
settlements fairly divide water resources providing 
the downstream agencies with the guaranteed 
amounts they desired while providing 
the upstream, Valley District service area, the 
flexibility they desired. The resulting court 
judgments are still used to this day to manage 
water resources. To help reduce the possibility 
of costly lawsuits in the future by providing a 
forum where water issues could be discussed, 
Valley District along with Orange County 
Water District, Chino Basin Municipal Water 
District (now Inland Empire Utilities Agency), 
and Western Municipal Water District formed 
the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority. 

Pat was also instrumental in settling a 40-
year legal dispute that involved both the Department 
of Water Resources and Metropolitan 
Water District of Southern California 
(MWDSC). He directed the effort to negotiate 
with MWDSC which led to a cooperative 
agreement. Under that agreement, MWDSC 
has purchased some of Valley District’s unused 
imported water from the State Water 
Project resulting in substantial revenues used 
to build facilities and purchase water for storage 
locally. The agreement also benefited 
MWDSC when their partially completed Inland 
Feeder Pipeline was connected to Valley District’s 
Foothill Pipeline allowing MWDSC to fill 
their newly constructed Diamond Valley Reservoir 
before their pipeline was complete. 

When Pat took office, Valley District had a 
contract with the State of California to receive 
up to 98,000 acre-feet of water from the State 
Water Project but Valley District had no facilities 
in place to distribute the water. Under his 
leadership, Valley District built a regional pipeline 
system that began with the 84,000 foot 
long, 6.5 foot diameter Foothill Pipeline. The 
system now spans from Rialto in the west to 
Yucaipa in the east. To save money, these facilities 
were built in partnership with other 
water agencies. Pat shepherded this ambitious 
project through good and bad economic times, 
and never lost the vision to complete these regional 
facilities. Later, Valley District had the 
foresight to purchase an additional 4,600 acre-
feet of entitlement water raising the total annual 
amount to 102,600 acre-feet. Pat was the 
innovator and force behind using ‘‘Super 
Wells’’ to lower high groundwater conditions in 
South San Bernardino to help prevent liquefaction, 
a new term at that time, during earthquakes. 
The super wells and accompanying 
pipeline, known as the Baseline Feeder, 
pumped the nuisance high groundwater to 
meet needs in Rialto. On the east end of the 
valley, additional facilities were added that enabled 
the transport of local storm water. These 
facilities, in combination with other local facilities, 
were used in a creative arrangement to 
meet supplemental water needs in the 
Yucaipa area without construction of a pipeline 
to Yucaipa. The agreement, known as the 
‘‘Exchange Plan’’, enabled Mill Creek water to 
be delivered to Yucaipa in exchange for State 
Water Project (SWP) water. 

Pat has always looked out for the Valley in 
which he grew up. In the early 1970’s the 
United States Army Corps of Engineers un


veiled an ambitious flood control plan on the 
Santa Ana River that included the proposed 
Mentone Dam that would capture both the 
Santa Ana River and Mill Creek. While the 
Mentone Dam made sense as a flood control 
facility, it did not make sense to people that 
lived in the valley. The dam would have created 
an eyesore on the east end of the valley 
and covered over most of the community of 
East Highland! Valley District took the lead in 
encouraging alternate proposals and in 1986, 
the Army Corps agreed to an alterative that 
moved the dam into the foothills where it 
stands today. Under Pat’s leadership, the 
Seven Oaks Dam is being used not only for 
flood control but also for water supply. Valley 
District, on behalf of water customers throughout 
the valley, partnered with the Western Municipal 
Water District and secured Water Right 
Permits to capture the newly detained water 
made available by the construction of the 
Dam. The capture of this water, which would 
have historically flowed into the Pacific Ocean, 
will save the people of the valley hundreds of 
millions of dollars. 

Pat has always understood the value of the 
investment in the State Water Project. When 
that value was threatened by the Department 
of Water Resources and other State Water 
Contractors, Pat directed litigation to protect 
the District’s contract right to sell any unused 
imported water at a fair price. Valley District 
prevailed and the resulting revenue has been 
used over the years to help fund regional facilities, 
reducing local costs. 

Pat has always believed in good planning 
backed by solid science. Valley District has 
been a leader in studying the valley’s resources 
to determine the opportunities and 
constraints. Through a relationship with the 
United States Geological Survey that has 
lasted decades, a groundwater flow model 
was produced which has proven invaluable to 
analyze water management scenarios and 
new projects. This model continues to be enhanced 
and is used every year to develop a 
management plan for the valley. 

This year, Pat announced that he would be 
retiring from the Valley District Board. His vision 
and leadership will be dearly missed by 
both the Board and the Staff. I commend Pat 
for his years of leadership and service and 
wish him all the best.

HONORING MRS. RUBY HUNT 

HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 

OF MINNESOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor the public service of Ruby Hunt. Mrs. 
Hunt has dedicated her life to working for the 
public good. Her efforts were instrumental in 
leading good governance efforts in both the 
City of Saint Paul and Ramsey County, Minnesota. 


Ruby was introduced to the world of public 
service as a long time and highly active member 
of the League of Women Voters. Her work 
with the League led to a leadership position 
on the Charter Commission where she was instrumental 
in crafting and passing the Saint 
Paul City Charter. The new Charter created a 
strong mayoral form of government, increased 
accountability for the city budget, and profes


sionalized the operation of city departments. 
Mrs. Hunt was only the third woman elected to 
the Saint Paul City Council, serving from 1972 
to 1982. During that time, she continued to improve 
the functions of city government including 
moving the Housing and Redevelopment 
Authority under the control of the City Council. 
In 1983, Mrs. Hunt was elected to the Ramsey 
County Board of Commissioners and served 
until 1995. As a Commissioner, she played a 
vital role in the establishment of the Ramsey 
County manager position and the privatization 
of Regions Hospital through Health Partners. 
She also had an early role in the development 
of the Central Corridor/Green Line Light Rail 
Transit corridor. 

Ruby is a quiet leader with a passion for 
building alliances across lines and working toward 
social justice. She has dedicated her 
lifework to the common good and even in retirement 
continues to make the world a better 
place. She is committed to mentoring women 
as public servants and encouraging them to 
become government leaders. 

In recognition of her lifelong commitment to 
public service and achievements as an elected 
official for over 20 years, Ruby Hunt was selected 
by Hamline University as the first recipient 
of the Women in Public Service Lifetime 
Achievement Award in 2012. As a former 
Saint Paul City Council Member and Ramsey 
County Commissioner with a passion for good 
governance and social justice, Mrs. Hunt truly 
exemplifies the spirit of the award. On November 
14, 2014, Hamline University is celebrating 
the establishment of the Ruby Hunt Endowed 
Scholarship in Public Administration. Establishing 
a scholarship devoted to women in 
Mrs. Hunt’s honor is a fitting recognition of her 
contributions. 

Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring 
Ruby Hunt’s many substantive and impressive 
contributions to Minnesota’s Capitol City and 
Ramsey County. Our nation is grateful for the 
selfless commitment she has made throughout 
her life supporting and encouraging others.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to introduce a Resolution Congratulating 
and Honoring Malala Yousafzai, Recipient 
of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize.

for her outstanding contributions to global education 
equality. As the youngest Nobel laureate 
in history, Ms. Yousafzai has distinguished 
herself as a courageous and tireless 
activist for gender equality in education despite 
being met with great adversity. After surviving 
an assassination attempt by Taliban 
gunmen she has emerged as a leading advocate 
for gender equality in education in a time 
when approximately 13 million school age girls 
in her home country of Pakistan remain deprived 
of an education and where girls’

schools continue to be targeted by militants. 
Her strength, determination and accomplishments 
are deserving of recognition. 

I welcome my colleagues in the House to 
join me in honoring and congratulating Malala 
Yousafzai on receiving the 2014 Nobel Peace 
Prize by becoming a co-sponsor of this resolution.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF COMER 
COTTRELL 

HON. MARC A. VEASEY 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
remembrance of Comer Cottrell, one of Texas’ 
leading African American entrepreneurs and 
an education philanthropist in the Dallas community. 
His passing on October 3, 2014, 
leaves a void in the city of Dallas, and I join 
with the Texas community in giving our condolences 
to the Cottrell family. 

Comer Cottrell was born on December 7, 
1931, in Mobile, Alabama. He was 15 when 
he graduated from a private high school in 
1946 and attended the University of Detroit, a 
Jesuit college. At age seventeen, Mr. Cottrell 
joined the United States Air Force and excelled 
to the the rank of First Sergeant at a 
very young age. After completing his military 
service, Cottrell returned to Alabama, where 
he worked part time for his father’s insurance 
company. 

In 1968, Mr. Cottrell recalled his time serving 
in the U.S. Air Force and the lack of ethnic 
hair-care products, which sparked his interest 
in the black hair care business. In 1970, Mr. 
Cottrell and his brother James Cottrell founded 
Pro-Line Corporation, an African-American 
hair care products company in Los Angeles, 
California. The company’s success grew and 
prompted his move to Dallas, Texas in 1979. 

In 1990, Mr. Cottrell purchased and restored 
the former Bishop College land in southern 
Dallas to persuade Paul Quinn College to 
move its campus from Waco to Dallas, Texas. 
Today, the historically black college continues 
to provide educational opportunities for the entrepreneurs 
of tomorrow. In addition to his interest 
in education philanthropy, Mr. Cottrell 
became the first African-American to hold a 
major stake in a professional baseball team. In 
1989, he became a part owner, with George 

W. Bush, of the Texas Rangers. 
Mr. Cottrell is survived by his wife, Felisha 
Starks Cottrell of Dallas; a daughter, Renee 
Cottrell-Brown of Arlington; four sons, Comer 
Cottrell III of Dallas, Aaron Cottrell of New 
York, Bryce Cottrell, a University of Texas at 
Austin student, and Lance Cottrell, a University 
of Colorado student; a brother, James 
Cottrell of Dallas; nine grandchildren; and one 
great-grandchild. 
In honor of Mr. Comer Cottrell, a pillar of the 
Dallas business community, this statement will 
be entered into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
on Wednesday, November 12, 2014. 

RECOGNIZING THE HOUSE 
GERMAN-AMERICAN CAUCUS 

HON. JIM GERLACH 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. GERLACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the House German-American Caucus 
and the work it has done to maintain and 
strengthen the economic and cultural relationship 
between the United States and Germany. 

The German-American Caucus is an informal, 
bipartisan group of House Members that 
was established in 2011. The idea of the Caucus 
originated with one of my constituents in 
Pennsylvania’s 6th District, Thomas 
Siedenbuehl, who is a native of Germany and 
now a proud U.S. citizen. Given the countless 
contributions that early and recent German 
e´migre´s have made to our nation, the formation 
of a caucus to bridge the historical, cultural 
and economic ties of the U.S. and Germany 
was most appropriate. 

In total, over 50 million American citizens 
claim German ancestry. Additionally, Germany 
is not only the largest economy in the European 
Union and third largest in the world, but 
the largest market for U.S. goods in Europe, 
importing more than $50 billion each year. 
German-owned companies are investing in 
America and have created approximately one 
million jobs in the U.S. Because of these 
strong economic and cultural ties, the Caucus 
has worked to build a closer relationship with 
our European ally to encourage further investment 
in America. 

In addition to the numerous roundtable discussions 
and dinners between Members of 
Congress and the German Bundestag, as well 
as with the German Ambassador and U.S. 
Ambassador to Germany, the Caucus has 
helped facilitate various other events that highlight 
and strengthen German-American ties. 
These include the Congress Bundestag Youth 
Exchange, the Maifest Dinner, and the annual 
Oktoberfest celebration. The Caucus also 
works closely with the German-American Business 
Council and its executive committee 
chairman, Uli Gamerdinger, who provides outstanding 
advice and support for Caucus activity. 


Mr. Speaker, in recognition of the work the 
Caucus has done to maintain and strengthen 
the relationship between the United States 
and Germany, and with the hope of continuing 
the work it has begun, I ask my colleagues to 
join me today in recognizing the efforts of the 
German-American Caucus of the United 
States House of Representatives.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 90TH AN


NIVERSARY OF THE ATLANTIC 

HIGHLANDS LIONS CLUB 

HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the Atlantic Highlands Lions Club 
as its members gather to celebrate its 90th 
anniversary this year. This milestone and its 
commitment to service is truly deserving of 
this body’s recognition. 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1527 

Founded by local businessmen, the Atlantic 
Highlands Lions Club was chartered on December 
14, 1924. Over its 90 years, the Atlantic 
Highlands Lions Club has grown in outreach 
and in membership. Today, its 42 members 
continue to carry out the mission of Lions 
Club International, serving its local community, 
the State of New Jersey, our nation and the 
world. Its efforts provide a range of assistance, 
including heath programs, youth programs, 
environmental programs, and disaster 
relief. It has also sponsored Lions Clubs in 
nearby New Jersey communities as well as 
the local Leo Club, which was one of the first 
Leo Clubs established in New Jersey. 

The Atlantic Highlands Lions Club has been 
providing active community volunteer work 
since its inception. Its members promote the 
Lions Club International mission to improve 
eye health and sight, providing free eye 
exams, eye treatments and surgery to local 
residents. They also uphold the mission to 
provide disaster relief, supporting recovery efforts 
in Indonesia, Haiti, Honduras and the 
United States, including New Jersey and its 
own community in the wake of Superstorm 
Sandy. Among many other community service 
efforts, the Atlantic Highlands Lions Club provides 
scholarships to local students, has taken 
part in the Lions Club International project to 
plant one million trees globally, honored our 
nation’s veterans through the purchase of a 
state highway construction project that would 
become a median in their honor (which the Atlantic 
Highlands Lions Club still maintains and 
enhances), helped develop the Atlantic Highlands 
Harbor, and provided evacuation assistance 
from New York City after the September 
11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The Atlantic Highlands 
Lions Club also pays the club membership 
dues of a member of the United States 
Coast Guard and encouraged Lions Club 
International to offer membership discounts to 
members of the military. 

Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope that my colleagues 
will join me in congratulating the Atlantic 
Highlands Lions Club on its 90th anniversary 
and thanking its members for their 
dedication to local, statewide, national and 
international community service.

GREG KOMESHOK 

HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Greg Komeshok’s leadership and 
dedication to the community of Passaic and 
the citizens of New Jersey. To honor his years 
of commitment, his friends, family, and colleagues 
joined together in October to celebrate 
his amazing career. 

Greg Komeshok son of John and Emily 
Komeshok, a life-long resident of Passaic, 
New Jersey was born on March 23, 1947. A 
product of the Passaic School District, Greg 
graduated from Holy Rosary grammar school 
and Passaic High School where he played on 
both the basketball and baseball teams. After 
high school, Greg went on to further his education 
where he earned his Bachelor’s in Industrial 
Arts and a Master’s in Administration 
and Supervision from Montclair State University. 
Upon achieving both of his degrees, Greg 

became a teacher at Passaic High School, 
later becoming the Principal at the Learning 
Center Elementary School in Passaic. Greg 
also held various administrative positions 
throughout the Passaic Board of Education, 
before becoming the Supervisor of Physical 
Education and Health, and later appointed to 
become the Director of Athletics. 

Greg’s achievements and passion in serving 
his community has led him to hold various 
leadership roles within his community. After 
being a lifetime member of the Holy Rosary 
Young Men’s Club, he became its President. 
Later, he went on to serve as the President of 
the Passaic Boys and Girls Club. Through his 
leadership and dedication, he was able to establish 
the annual outdoor Jimmy Sturr Concert 
in Passaic which is now in its eleventh 
year. Greg’s devotion to the community and to 
the youth led him to the Clifton Little League 
and Babe Ruth League where he served as 
Coach. Later, he went on to become the General 
Manager/Coach of the Wayne Post 174 
American Legion Baseball League, then becoming 
the President of the Bergen Area 
American Legion Baseball League. 

His service to his community even led him 
to pursue public office. In 1968, he became a 
Member of the Passaic Redevelopment Agency; 
later in his career in 1972 he was selected 
to become the Chairman of the Democratic 
Party in the City of Passaic. Then in 1976, he 
was a Delegate to the Democratic National 
Convention in New York City. In 1978, Greg 
was given the opportunity to serve his State 
when he was appointed to the North Jersey 
District Water Supply Commission, where he 
served as Commissioner. In 1983 he was 
elected to the Passaic County Board of Chosen 
Freeholders and later in 1985 was selected 
to become the Freeholder Director. In 
1984 Greg became a member of the Camp 
Hope Commission and the Passaic County 
Community College-Board of School Estimates. 


Greg is married to his wife Susan, and they 
have two sons Kevin and Christopher. 

The job of a United States Congressman involves 
much that is rewarding, yet nothing 
compares to recognizing and commemorating 
the services of individuals like Mr. Greg 
Komeshok. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, 
Mr. Komeshok’s family, friends, and 
all those whose lives he has touched, and me, 
in recognizing Greg Komeshok for his dedication 
to his family and his nation.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DESIGNATION 
OF THE ‘‘JUANITA 
MILLENDER-MCDONALD POST OFFICE’’ 


HON. JANICE HAHN 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, as you know, here 
in Washington we have the unique opportunity 
to work for the citizens of this great nation and 
provide positive change in the lives of many. 
Together we work for the good of our communities, 
and in the process we cross paths with 
some remarkable leaders. 

Today I am introducing a bill that will recognize 
the life of one of those very special lead


ers of our time, the late Congresswoman Juanita 
Millender-McDonald, by designating a facility 
of the United States Postal Service in my 
district as the ‘‘Juanita Millender-McDonald 
Post Office. 

Rep. Millender-McDonald was a pillar in 
many of the communities I represent. She was 
a resilient public servant who was deeply 
loved by her community first as an educator, 
then as program coordinator for a nonprofit 
fighting gender issues, and finally as a beloved 
elected official. Undaunted by the work 
to be done, Rep. Millender-McDonald took 
charge of her opportunity to serve and became 
the first African American woman to be 
named Chairwoman of the House Committee 
on Administration. She was also an active 
member of the Congressional Black Caucus 
and served over a decade in the House of 
Representatives. 

An exemplary piece of her legacy was her 
work to better the lives of not just those here 
at home but internationally as well. Her work 
to aid victims of genocide and human trafficking 
serves a testament to her dedication to 
creating a better world. Millender-McDonald 
worked tirelessly for her constituents taking 
only a week of leave before she succumbed to 
cancer. 

By designating a United States Postal Service 
facility in my district as the ‘‘Juanita 
Millender-McDonald Post Office,’’ we honor an 
exemplary woman with an incredible public 
service record that I hope will further serve as 
inspiration for the community which I serve— 
the same community which so revered her.

TRIBUTE TO THE COLUMBIA CLUB 

HON. TODD ROKITA 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and salute an extraordinary Hoosier 
institution, The Columbia Club, which celebrates 
its 125th anniversary this year. I wish to 
express my admiration and appreciation for 
the Club and its members’ service to our community, 
state, and country. 

The Columbia Club was originally formed in 
1889 by local prominent Republicans as the 
Harrison Marching Society to support the presidential 
campaign of the last Hoosier president, 
Benjamin Harrison. After the election, 
the Society moved into a clubhouse on Monument 
Circle and changed its name to the Columbia 
Club to continue operating as a private 
club. As its membership grew, the Columbia 
Club became the premier private club in Indianapolis. 
No longer a partisan club; the Columbia 
Club welcomes Hoosiers of all political 
stripes and affiliations as members to share in 
fellowship. 

The Columbia Club’s members can also join 
associations within the Club. It hosts the Columbian 
Business Network, Columbian Veteran’s 
Association, Columbia Club Devine 
Dames—a chapter of the National Red Hat 
Society, and the Harrison Society—the Club’s 
premier group for young professionals. 

In 1925, the current home of the Columbia 
Club was built on Indianapolis’ famed Monument 
Circle on the very location that the original 
building was once located. In 1983, the 
current structure was added to the National 


E1528 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks November 12, 2014 

Register of Historic Places. Legend indicates 
that the founders of the Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway, home of the Indianapolis 500, met 
at the club to discuss construction of the 
famed track. It also served as host to discussions 
that eventually brought the NFL’s Colts 
to Indianapolis. 

The Columbia Club has hosted every Republican 
President since Benjamin Harrison 
while in office or as a candidate. Thousands of 
business leaders and politicians have been 
members of the Club as have famous Hoosiers 
like musician Hoagy Carmichael and Impressionist 
T.C. Steele. Each year the Club 
holds its annual Beefsteak Dinner, of which I 
had the honor to keynote on October 7, of this 
year. 

Congratulations to the Columbia Club and 
all of its current and former members for the 
125 years of excellence in our Indianapolis 
community.

HONORING MR. ALBERT A. CURTIS, 
JR. 

HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 

OF MISSISSIPPI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor a man of noble character 
and determination, Mr. Albert A. Curtis, 
Jr. of Tallahatchie County. He is the son of 
Lucille and Albert Curtis, Sr. 

As a child: Like his father, Albert A. Curtis, 
Sr., he was a shrewd manager of a few assets. 
But here is how he got started. This was 
during a time when racism was considered acceptable. 
Albert, Sr. saw no racism in money. 
And as a little boy Albert, Jr. learned that as 
he watched his father conduct business with 
Blacks, Whites and everyone else. Albert Sr. 
had several mantra’s his son would often hear 
him say like, ‘‘A lil negotiation don’t hurt, but 
don’t compromise your beliefs and dignity.’’ or 
‘‘A bicycle of your own is better than someone 
else’s Cadillac . . . always work hard cause 
nobody is going to give you anything’’ and 
‘‘Sometimes you got to lose to win.’’ 

Time to grow-up: Albert, Jr.’s mother, Lucille 
died suddenly when he was eight (8) years 
old. But because of his strong belief in family 
and deep love for his wife, Albert, Sr. felt that 
was all gone when she died. He was broken 
hearted and turned to alcohol to escape the 
reality of that inevitable change. Albert, Jr. 
saw his father lose his will to live and began 
losing the businesses he had worked so hard 
to build. Those businesses also provided the 
financial support for the family. The family 
began moving around from place to place until 
Mattie Curtis took the family in, which is Albert 
Jr.’s grandmother. The family began to hire 
out, young Albert, Jr. to work on other farms 
for money and to work odd jobs. Unfortunately, 
young Albert remembers how his father 
would take the money from him to buy alcohol 
instead of support the family. Rather than defy 
his father in any way, he simply quit school to 
increase his work hours, believing he could 
continue giving his father the ‘‘little’’ money 
and the extra money he would make by increasing 
his hours, he thought some money 
would go to the family. This was a life changing 
decision for a young boy—who didn’t truly 
understand. 

His schoolmates started seeing him around 
and they began to make fun of Albert, Jr. with 
words like ‘‘He done quit school and ain’t gon’ 
mount to nothin’ . . . plus he smells like 
horses and mules.’’ Well, Albert just kept on 
because his father’s words and work ethics 
were deep inside of him, ‘‘Never give up and 
make people’s ideas of you a lie!’’ As he grew 
older, people began to notice him never wavering, 
never quitting, steadfast, and focused, 
but they just didn’t see anything—material that 
is. 

Time to start a family: In 1964, Albert, Jr. 
met and married Alma ‘‘Emma’’ Jean Blackburn. 
She was his soul-mate and helpmate— 
heaven sent. She was strong in areas he was 
weak. He was hard working and could make 
money while she was strong minded and book 
smart (as they called it). Emma managed the 
books, opened up bank accounts, paid the 
bills . . . she took care of the family business. 
Soon the couple had acquired enough money 
and assets that they were able to purchase 
their own home and leave Grandma Curtis’ 
home. 

Albert, Jr. then with the support of this wife, 
set out to re-acquire all the land and holding 
his father had lost. He began buying land back 
from his family members (e.g., aunts and uncles 
and anyone who had his daddy’s land). 
He was the only one who had the money to 
do this. Eventually Albert, Jr. was able to buy 
back all the property and land his father had 
owned but two (2) pieces of property.—Now, 
it’s not known of anyone else accomplishing 
this, but Albert deserves being recognized and 
applauded. 

But wait, this story is not over . . . Remember, 
Albert, Jr. was never wavering, never 
quitting, always steadfast and focused, and 
didn’t understand because they just didn’t see 
anything—material that is. Well, by now he 
managed to acquire a wife, home of his own, 
money in the bank, all his daddy’s previously 
owned property (but 2 pieces) and now property 
of his own. Albert continued until he was 
able to acquire 52 residential properties, commercial 
properties, more acres of land, several 
types of businesses of his own (e.g., plumbing, 
and financing for other small business 
owners) and work a full-time job for the City of 
Public Works in the community he lived. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
today in recognizing the legacy of Mr. Albert 

A. Curtis, Jr. of Tallahatchie County, from the 
Second Congressional District of Mississippi.

IN RECOGNITION OF BARBRA 
SIPERSTEIN 

HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Barbra ‘‘Babs’’ Siperstein as she is 
honored with the Stonewall Legacy Award by 
The Pride Network at their New Jersey Leadership 
Awards Dinner. It is truly a fitting tribute 
to recognize Ms. Siperstein as we celebrate 
LGBT History Month as she has played such 
a vital role in the LGBT movement. 

Born Barry Siperstein, Barbra Siperstein acknowledged 
her true identity when she was 
nearly 50 years old. In 2007, she legally 
changed her name and the following year 

changed her Hebrew name to Baila Chaya in 
a ceremony at her synagogue, Congregation 
Beth Mordecai in Perth Amboy. 

Through her own journey, Ms. Siperstein 
became a pioneer of transgender equality. 
She is a political activist and a staunch advocate 
for lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender (LGBT) causes. In 2009 she became 
the first openly transgender member 
confirmed to the Democratic National Committee 
(DNC). Additionally, she was appointed 
to the New Jersey Civil Union Review Commission 
and served as Vice Chair of Garden 
State Equality. She has also been a member 
of the DNC’s executive committee, deputy vice 
chair of the New Jersey Democratic State 
Committee and president of the New Jersey 
Stonewall Democrats. 

Ms. Siperstein was married for 34 years to 
the late Carol Siperstein, who stayed by her 
side until she lost a sudden battle with cancer 
in 2001. Together, they had a daughter and 
two sons. In addition to her activism, Barbra is 
a United States Army Veteran and a small-
business owner. 

Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope that my colleagues 
will join me in congratulating Barbra 
Siperstein on receiving the prestigious Stonewall 
Legacy Award and thanking her for her 
continuous efforts on behalf of the LGBT community.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
EDUARDO POSADA 

HON. ALAN GRAYSON 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, in 
honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, to recognize 
Eduardo Posada. Born in Puerto Rico on 
February 8, 1929, his father was a Colombian 
native and his mother was Puerto Rican. He 
spent his early years in New York City until 
1935, when his family moved back to Puerto 
Rico. Except for two brief stints back in New 
York, Ed stayed in Puerto Rico where he obtained 
his BA from the Polytechnic Institute of 
Puerto Rico (now Universidad Interamericana 
de Puerto Rico) in 1949. 

Ed worked for two years in Puerto Rico as 
a secondary school teacher. He married 
Urania Feliciano and had a son, Luis. The 
family then moved to New York, where Ed 
joined the U.S. Air Force. While serving at 
Governor’s Island, New York, Ed and his wife 
had a second son, Danny. In June, 1955 Ed 
was separated from the Air Force as a sergeant 
and assigned to the U.S. Air Force Reserves. 
In 1956, he was found unfit for active 
duty and discharged from the service due to 
disabilities. 

Ed went to work as a secondary school 
teacher and completed his MA at Hunter College 
of the City University of New York in 
1959. Ed eventually became Assistant Dean 
for Boys at Theodore Roosevelt High School. 

The family next moved to Miami where Ed 
continued to teach until 1987, when he retired. 
While in Miami, he had the honor of being part 
of the newly formed United Teachers of Dade 
and served as vice president for the group. In 
1987, Ed retired from teaching and moved to 
Orlando with his wife. 

Ed has since been an active member of the 
American Legion, Korean War Veterans, and 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1529 

the Disabled American Veterans (DAV). He 
has held leadership positions in all three organizations 
and, at present, he is a member of 
the executive board and legislative officer for 
the local chapter of the DAV. He also volunteers 
at the VA Medical Center and runs the 
Bingo event once a month at the VA nursing 
home in Lake Nona. 

I am happy to recognize Eduardo Posada, 
during Hispanic Heritage Month, for his service 
to our country and the Central Florida 
community.

BERGEN 350TH ANNIVERSARY 
GALA 

HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
bring to your attention the outstanding 
achievement of the 350th anniversary of New 
Jersey’s statehood. Furthermore, I am proud 
to celebrate the historic tradition of Bergen 
County and its many important contributions to 
the history of New Jersey as part of the Bergen 
350 Gala. As one of the first four original 
counties of New Jersey, I have the honor of 
being its Representative in the U.S. Congress. 

Founded by Dutch settlers in the 17th century, 
the area of Bergen County was settled as 
part of the New Netherlands, the 17th century 
North American colonial province of the Dutch 
Republic. In 1683, Bergen County received official 
recognition as an independent county by 
New Jersey’s provincial assembly. 

It is clear that Bergen County has played a 
crucial role in shaping the proud history of the 
Garden State. 

In the Revolutionary War, Bergen County 
demonstrated its commitment to American 
independence. In fact, Fort Lee served as a 
key strategic asset to General Washington 
and his army. 

In the Civil War, Company K of the 22nd 
Volunteer Infantry Regiment trained at the 
Civil War Drill Hall Theatre, which still stands 
in Leonia today. In World War I, Bergen County 
made use of innovative agricultural knowledge 
to support the war effort, canning fruits 
and vegetables and sending them to where 
they were needed. 

After the nation fell into the Great Depression, 
Bergen County hosted numerous Work 
Projects Administration projects like the murals 

that decorate the County Courthouse in Hackensack. 
At the onset of World War II, Bergen 
County once again demonstrated its commitment 
to the nation, with more than 26,000 of 
its residents enlisting to serve. 

In the Civil Rights Era, Teaneck became 
one of the earliest towns to voluntarily integrate 
its public schools by busing, doing so in 
1964. 

I am truly honored to represent Bergen 
County as part of New Jersey’s 9th Congressional 
District in the United States Congress. 
As such, I was proud to cosponsor H. Res. 
624, to honor the 350th anniversary of the 
founding of New Jersey and recognize the valuable 
contributions of people of the Garden 
State. 

As we move forward, I would like to recognize 
the Bergen County Historical Society and 
the Bergen 350 Gala on October 15th, 2014 to 
commemorate the role of Bergen County in 
light of the state of New Jersey’s 350th Anniversary. 


Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me, our colleagues, 
and the state of New Jersey in recognizing 
the historic contributions of Bergen 
County in honor of the 350th anniversary of 
New Jersey’s statehood.

CONGRATULATING COACH JOHN 
GILLEN 

HON. TIM RYAN 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate my former coach and dear 
friend, Mr. John Gillen, for his over 50 years 
of incredible work at my alma mater, John F. 
Kennedy High School. His titles were athletic 
director, coach, and teacher, but those were 
just labels. Coach Gillen was a role model for 
me and many other student athletes. He was 
fair, dedicated, and had a great sense of 
humor. But most importantly he was able to 
give us the tough love that was so often needed 
to instill discipline and resiliency. He would 
spend countless hours at our school and 
would ask for so little in return. His joy and fulfillment 
comes from shaping the minds and 
spirits of the young people at our school. 

I will never forget watching daily as a high 
school student Mr. G quietly stepping into the 
school chapel. He took time to pray, meditate, 
and to thank God for all of his blessings. That 
stuck with me as I walked my own personal 
spiritual journey. I have him to thank for, 
through his modeling and leadership the encouragement 
to pursue my own personal journey. 
For that I will be forever grateful as it is 
the best gift he could have given to me. I 
treasure my experiences on and off the field 
with Coach Gillen. He represents the best of 
Kennedy High School and the best example of 
what it means to be a practicing Catholic. If 
those who know him could measure up to be 
half the person he is we would vastly improve 
our schools, our community, and our nation in 
countless ways. 

I would like to also submit the following article 
that appeared in the Tribune Chronicle on 
August 9, 2014 in his honor. 

STILL GOING STRONG GILLEN A LEGEND IN 
KENNDY HISTORY 
WARREN.—John Gillen likes to keep things 
simple and understated. Nothing displays 

that more than the tiny office Gillen occupies 
as the Athletic Director at John F. Kennedy 
High School. Tucked in behind the 
ticket office next to the gymnasium that’s 
named after him, the work space can best be 
described as a cubicle. With a desk, chair and 
some filing cabinets in place, there’s no 
more than 50 square feet of walking space. 
To get a view of the outside world, Gillen has 
to step from the office and peek through the 
ticket office towards a set of doors. To some 
it might seem a bit claustrophobic, but to 
Gillen it’s served with the comfort a tree 
house would to a young boy for decades. 

John F. Kennedy athletic director John 
Gillen is shown in his office at the high 
school. Gillen has been AD since 1971 and was 
a part of the first staff when Kennedy opened 
its doors in 1964. ‘‘I never wanted to move,’’ 
Gillen said as he took a break from work on 
a late July day. ‘‘They asked me if I wanted 
to move down close to the main offices. I 
like it here. It would probably make a great 
bomb shelter if we ever get attacked; or a 
hurricane or earthquake; this would be the 
place to come.’’ Gillen moved to the office 
from a nearby work space that was even 
smaller. To the best of his recollection, he’s 
been in the current office about 35 years, 
which was about seven years into what is 
now his 42nd year as athletic director. 

It probably seems like only yesterday to 
Gillen, who is living proof that the love of 
work and an active mind can keep a person 
young at heart. Gillen doesn’t show much of 
his 81 years other than the usual gray hair 
and perhaps slower walk that are inevitable 
with the aging process. His mind is sharp, 
which it has to be to deal with the demands 
of a job that can be thankless and rewarding 
at the same time. How he does it when most 
people his age have given in to retirement or 
infirmity is remarkable. The phone calls 
from parents upset about a child’s lack of 
playing time. The constant demands of 
scheduling at a time when it’s become impossible 
to find an area conference willing to 
extend JFK an invitation to the club. The secret 
for Gillen is to keep physically active 
and tap into the energy of those around him, 
including his wife Gloria, and an unwavering 
faith in God. It starts with a workout with 
light weights every morning. ‘‘Dealing with 
the kids,’’ Gillen said. ‘‘They keep you 
young. They’ll keep you on your toes, I’ll 
tell you.’’ 

Another key to Gillen’s longevity is his 
humility and the accommodating manner in 
which he’s treated those he’s worked with all 
these years. Ask any JFK coach that’s had 
dealings with Gillen, and you won’t find one 
that will say a bad word about him. ‘‘John is 
a very calm, easy-going guy,’’ said Dennis 
Zolciak, who coached the Eagles’ football 
team from 1977–90. ‘‘The thing is his heart is 
totally into the school. He wants what’s best 
for the school.’’ There are generally two 
types of athletic directors—ones that want 
control of everything, including calling a few 
plays, and ones that take a back seat and try 
to make life as easy as possible for the 
coaches. Gillen fits the latter category to 
the max, always being careful to meet the 
demands of every coach, even if he might not 
agree with all the requests. ‘‘He couldn’t do 
enough for you, and then some,’’ said Tony 
Napolet, the football coach from 1970–72 and 
1991–2010. 

Few people know Gillen better than 
Napolet, whom Gillen coached in football at 
St. Mary’s Junior High School more than 60 
years ago. The two are as much a part of the 
athletic fabric at JFK as any person ever associated 
with the school. ‘‘He’s the best part 
of that place,’’ Napolet said. ‘‘He’s been 
there 50 years. Since before they opened. He 
loves it. That place is his life.’’ Gillen was 
raised here and graduated from St. Mary’s 


E1530 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks November 12, 2014 

High School in 1950. He coached basketball 
and served as the school’s athletic director 
before moving to JFK High School when it 
opened in 1964. He taught and coached before 
replacing Jim McQuaide as athletic director 
in 1972. Gillen has worked closely with each 
of JFK’s six football coaches prior to this 
season. From George Landis in 1964 to 
McQuaide (1965–69), followed by Napolet, 
Gene Nara (1973–76), Zolciak, Napolet again 
and Dave Pappada (2011–12). He’s begun 
working this year with first-year coach Jeff 
Bayuk. Add the coaches of other sports, boys 
and girls, and you can begin to understand 
how many lives Gillen has touched. 

‘‘When the bricks for the school came together, 
John was there,’’ said Dennis 
Jasinski, basketball coach from 1978–89. 
‘‘He’s a solid part of the whole thing. We always 
got along. He was a pleasure to work 
with. He’s a gentleman and a friend.’’ 
Jasinski recalls a time when Gillen was set 
to scout a future basketball opponent but at 
the last minute had to cancel. Jasinski assumed 
the task of driving to Akron, which 
led to a surprising moment when he settled 
into his seat to begin taking notes. ‘‘I went 
with an assistant coach and a minute before 
the game started, who comes walking in? I 
said, ‘John, I thought you couldn’t scout,’’’ 
Jasinski said. ‘‘He said, ‘I told my wife I was 
going out for a loaf of bread.’ That’s the type 
of guy he was. He was always willing to 
help.’’ Gillen doesn’t like to talk about himself. 
He’s more comfortable in the background, 
where he can let others accept the 
laurels of victory. He allows himself a moment 
of boastful pride when pointing out 
that each of his four sons—John, Brian, the 
late Tom and Jim—played on JFK football 
teams that made the playoffs. Brian and 
Tom were on the 1991 team that won the only 
state championship in school history. All 
Gillen needs these days to remain happy is 
morning exercise, daily prayer, the love of 
friends and family and a cozy seat in his tiny 
office. The one that sits a few strides from 
the gymnasium that bears his name. 

It will seem strange when the day arrives 
that Gillen is no longer the athletic director. 
Life will go on, but not quite the same. 
‘‘You’re only one part in a machine,’’ 
Zolciak said. ‘‘I’ve seen guys go, and the 
wheels keep turning. The great thing about 
John is he’s healthy, he can do things, and 
he’s glad he can do it. When the day comes 
and he leaves, the place will keep on going. 
I think he’s left a great legacy there.’’ Retirement 
can be a lonely place for those that 
thrived on work for lengthy periods of time. 
Some don’t handle it well but find a way to 
cope. Others give in to time and fade away 
quickly. Gillen has no fears when he contemplates 
retirement. 

‘‘A gentleman told me at one time, and I’ll 
never forget it,’’ he said. ‘‘When you retire, 
you know what you’re retiring from, but do 
you know what you’re retiring to? I’ve 
thought about that often. What would I do 
after I retire?’’ Exactly how will Gillen live 
life when that day arrives? ‘‘I won’t lay on 
the couch; I know that,’’ he said.

TRIBUTE TO KEN SHAW 

HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO 

OF WEST VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Colonel Kenneth ‘‘Ken’’ Alden Shaw 
(Ret.) who passed away Oct. 19, 2014 following 
a long battle with Parkinson’s disease. 
He was 80 years old and will be missed by 

many who he touched through his various professional, 
military and civic affiliations throughout 
his life. 

Ken was a native of my hometown, Charleston 
and graduated from Stonewall Jackson 
High School. He earned a Bachelor of Science 
in chemical engineering from Kansas State 
University in 1957. Following graduation, Ken 
moved to Ravenswood and was employed by 
Kaiser Aluminum as a chemical engineer. Ken 
worked for Kaiser for 28 years, including his 
role as Carbon Plant Superintendent with his 
final post as Environmental Services Superintendent. 
In this role, he managed the air, 
water, solid and hazardous waste environmental 
systems and procedures at the aluminum 
plant. In 1976, Ken also served as 
Carbon Plant Superintendent for the Kaiser 
Aluminum Smelter in Ghana, Africa. 

Ken had a long and distinguished military 
career in the West Virginia Army National 
Guard. He served in various line, staff and 
command positions with the Engineer Units of 
the State, which included Battalion Commander 
of the 1092nd Engineer Battalion. He 
further served as the Operations Officer and 
Commander of the 111th Engineer Group. In 
1963 he completed flight training, becoming a 
fixed wing, rotary wing and instrument qualified 
pilot. He served on continuous flight status 
until 1980 and was awarded the Master 
Aviator badge. Colonel Shaw’s military training 
included 34 specialty schools, including the Industrial 
College of the Armed Forces at Fort 
McNair in Washington, D.C., and the U.S. 
Army Command and General Staff College. 
Colonel Shaw was placed on active duty in 
1986 and appointed the United States Property 
and Fiscal Officer for West Virginia in 
Buckhannon. 

Ken was an active member of the community 
and held positions on many organizations 
in Jackson County, as well as national organizations 
such as Rotary International, Toastmasters 
International and Alpha Tau Omega 
fraternity. Ken was a longtime member of Our 
Savior Lutheran Church in Ravenswood. 

Ken is survived by his wife, Gayle Twigger-
Shaw; his sisters, Katherine Bowns of Tampa, 
Fla., and Nancy Burns of Ashville, N.C.; his 
children: daughters, Janie Frist (Moe) of Morgantown, 
Juli Seaman (Steve) of Leesburg, 
Va., and Carolyn Yost (Brian) of Clarksburg; 
and sons, Jim Spano (Beverly) of 
Ravenswood, Joe Spano (Donna) of Charleston 
and Mike Twigger of Charleston. Ken had 
six grandchildren, Joseph Spano Jr., 
Samantha Spano, Jessica Spano, Ian Frist, 
Jillian Frist and Hunter Yost. 

Mr. Speaker, the State of West Virginia, our 
communities, and indeed, the United States of 
America owe Colonel Shaw a debt of gratitude 
for his many years of distinguished service in 
his professional, military and personal life. I 
am honored to have known him and call him 
a fellow West Virginian.

RECOGNIZING MR. ALEX GORSKY 

HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, today I 
would like to recognize Mr. Alex Gorsky for his 
dedication and leadership to CADCA, Commu


nity Anti-Drug Coalitions of America. CADCA 
has honored Mr. Gorsky with the Humanitarian 
of the Year Award for his advocacy on behalf 
of CADCA’s Drug-Free Kids Campaign. 

Mr. Gorsky’s efforts with CADCA have had 
a profound impact on drug abuse prevention 
efforts in my district. Bucks Promise for Youth 
and Communities is comprised of a number of 
Drug Free Communities whose outstanding 
work to combat the rise of teen drug abuse in 
our community was recognized last year by 
CADCA. One of the success stories from the 
district is the Prescription Drug Take Back 
Program which has captured more than 19 
tons of unused medication since the program 
began just 4 years ago. The potential for 
these drugs to harm, addict, and take lives 
has been extinguished due to the vision and 
commitment of individuals like Alex Gorsky. 

On behalf of the constituents of the Pennsylvania’s 
8th Congressional District, I would 
like to express my sincerest gratitude and appreciation 
to Alex for his unrelenting support 
for CADCA’s mission—building safe, healthy 
and drug-free communities around the country 
and in my home state of Pennsylvania.

RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBU


TIONS OF KENNETH D. MCCLIN


TOCK 

HON. ALAN GRAYSON 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, in 
honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, to recognize 
Kenneth D. McClintock. McClintock 
served as the 22nd Secretary of State of the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. As Secretary 
of State, he fulfilled two roles, serving as the 
head of Puerto Rico’s Department of State 
and, perhaps even more important, serving as 
lieutenant governor. McClintock also served as 
Acting Governor whenever the Governor was 
away from Puerto Rico. 

As Secretary of State, he digitalized his department, 
reducing backlogs and speeding up 
services, in spite of having lost 60 percent of 
his employees through early retirements, attrition 
and involuntary layoffs triggered by the 
fiscal crisis of 2008 to 2009. Governor Fortun˜o 
delegated multiple additional responsibilities to 
McClintock, such as chairing the Advisory 
Council on Government Reform and Reorganization. 
McClintock’s government reorganization 
plans resulted in the streamlining of government 
services and agencies, the creation 
of new agencies, such as the Financial Education 
Institute, and multi-million dollar savings. 


McClintock capped a 16-year career as a 
member of the Puerto Rico Senate, serving as 
the 13th President of the Senate of Puerto 
Rico from 2005 to 2009. He also served as 
the youngest and the first Hispanic chairman 
of the nationwide Council of State Governments 
in 1999. In 2000, McClintock served as 
the second president of the hemispheric-wide 
Parliamentary Conference of the Americas 
(COPA). 

McClintock is the author of Puerto Rico’s 
Telecommunications Reform Law of 1996 as 
well as over 100 other laws. 

McClintock is an adjunct professor of US 
Government and Government Management at 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1531 

Interamerican University’s San Juan campus. 
He coauthored a book with Puerto Rico’s 
State Democratic Chair, Roberto Prats, about 
the 2008 Clinton presidential campaign in 
Puerto Rico, which they co-chaired. 

The founder of a congressional internship 
program that has been replicated by nineteen 
states and territories, he is a longtime board 
member of a DC-based nonprofit, The Washington 
Center for Academic Internships and 
Scholarships. In his spare time, McClintock is

COMMEMORATING THE SAC


RIFICES OF AMERICA’S VET


ERANS 

HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
pay tribute to all of the men and women who 
have worn the uniform of country and risked 
their lives to keep our nation free and safe. 

We come together to celebrate our veterans 
who have courageously defended our freedom, 
and honor the memory of those who 
have borne the battle, including the more than 
4,400 American servicemen and women who 
have died in Iraq and more than 2,200 who 
have died in Afghanistan. 

We also honor the sacrifices of over 50,000 
brave troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. 


Let us pay tribute to those currently serving 
around the globe as well as veterans and 
service men and women who are with us 
today as they have served our nation with 
honor and distinction. 

Today, I reaffirm my commitment to the nation’s 
more than 2 million troops and reservists, 
their families, and 22 million veterans, including 
32,477 in the 18th Congressional District 
of Texas, that they will be provided the 
quality job opportunities they have earned. 

A grateful nation cares for its soldiers, sailors, 
airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen, 
not only when they’re abroad, but also upon 
their return home. 

Congress must communicate its wholehearted 
support for the security of the nation 
and build upon the historic improvements 
made in strengthening quality health care for 
veterans and offering the promise of college to 
those returning from the battlefields of Iraq 
and Afghanistan. 

On the battlefield, the military pledges to 
leave no soldier behind. As a nation, it is our 
duty to leave no veteran behind. 

This day and every day, let us honor their 
service with actions that fulfill our commitment 
to our troops, their families, and our veterans—
and that are worthy of our grateful nation. 


HELPING ENCOURAGE REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR 
VETERANS 

I introduced H.R. 4110, the Transitioning 
Heroes Act, which amends the Internal Revenue 
Code to allow employers a business-related 
$1,000 tax credit for each veteran hired. 

ENSURING JOBS IN ENERGY FOR VETERANS 

I am proud to have authored legislation 
amending the Innovation Act (H.R. 3309) to include 
a provision requiring the PTO Director to 
evaluate the economic impact of the Innovation 
Act on the ability of veteran-owned small 
businesses to secure their right to their inventions 
and discoveries. 

This amendment was critical to our community 
of veterans and to the strength of our 
economy because historically veterans have 
struggled to adjust to life upon returning home. 

HELPING HOMELESS VETERANS 

The House of Representatives unanimously 
adopted an amendment I offered to the Military 
Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriation 
Act for FY 2015, which expresses the 
sense of Congress that programs designed to 
assist homeless veterans should receive priority 
consideration by the Department. 

Reducing and eliminating homelessness 
among veterans, those who risked their lives 
to protect our freedom, should be one of the 
nation’s highest priorities. My amendment will 
help ensure that the rate of homelessness 
among veterans in the United States does not 
increase. 

The Jackson Lee Amendment helps remind 
us of our obligation to provide our veterans 
the assistance needed to avoid homelessness, 
which includes adequate funding for Veterans 
Administration Supportive Housing (VASH) 
programs that provide case-management services, 
adequate housing facilities, mental health 
support, and address other areas that contribute 
to veteran homelessness. 

GUARANTEEING MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS TO MEET 

THE LONG TERM NEEDS OF OUR ARMED FORCES, VET


ERANS, AND THEIR FAMILIES 

I am also proud to have succeeded in 
amending H.R. 1960, the FY2014 National 
Defense Authorization Act to include my 
amendment providing qualified and professional 
mental health care to serve our armed 
forces members, veterans, and their families. 

Without proper mental health services veterans 
will fall short of full recovery and be less 
able to function as productive citizens. 

INCREASING PTSD FUNDING BY $5,000,000 

I succeeded in amending National Defense 
Appropriations Acts for FY2014 and FY2015 
to include my amendments providing $10 million 
in increased funding to treat veterans suffering 
from PTSD. 

The additional funding is necessary to identify 
the research needed to combat these diseases 
that are crippling our men and women 
in our Armed Services and their respective 
families. 

As we look to PTSD, some of a soldier’s 
wounds are invisible to the naked eye, for 
these are wounds that should be properly 
treated. 

One of the best ways to increase access to 
treatment is to increase the number of medical 
facilities and mental health professionals who 
are available to serve the needs of men and 
women currently serving and those who have 
become veterans. 

MAKING SURE OUR DISABLED VETERANS RECEIVE THE 

HEALTHCARE AND DISABILITY COMPENSATION THEY 

HAVE EARNED 

I co-sponsored the H.R. 333, the Disabled 
Veterans Tax Termination Act, which increases 
veteran’s pay and disability compensation 
and maintains secure, dependable 
and reliable veterans’ programs, especially for 
disabled veterans is very important. 

I also strongly supported and voted to pass 

H.R. 3202, the Veterans Access, Choice, and 
Accountability Act of 2014, which expands access 
to health care for veterans and addresses 
the shortage of health professionals in the 
VA. 
This legislation also ensures access to care 
for rural veterans and provides funding to establish 
27 new VA clinics, including a new research 
facility in Houston. 

The law also expands access to education 
for veterans and their families and extends a 
community-based housing program for veterans. 


From 2007 through 2010, when Democrats 
were the majority in both the House and the 
Senate, there was no government shutdown— 
the Congress made historic gains for America’s 
troops, veterans and military families. 

That is why the American Legion said 
‘‘111th Congress Achieves Banner Year on 
Veterans Legislation.’’ 

The real successes were the passage of 
bills that affected nearly every veteran in 
America. 

For example, the Democratically-led Congress: 


Enacted the new Post 9–11 GI Bill to restore 
the promise of a full, four-year college 
education, that has already allowed over 
700,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan 
Wars to afford college, just like after World 
War II, along with tax incentives for hiring to 
expand job opportunities for returning soldiers. 

Strengthened health care for more than 5 
million veterans, with a historic commitment— 
including the largest single increase in the history 
of the VA—for more doctors and nurses, 
better access for rural veterans, and expanded 
efforts to treat the signature injuries of the 
war, PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury, while 
enacting a law to guarantee timely and predictable 
funding for veterans’ health care and 
to address the health care needs of our nearly 
2 million female veterans. 

Provided troops and veterans the benefits 
they have earned and resources they need, 
giving troops a pay raise, restoring military 
readiness, providing the best training and 
equipment for the men and women serving in 
our Armed Forces, taking steps to reduce the 
backlog and wait for veterans trying to access 
their earned benefits, providing special payments 
for service members and veterans who 
were forced to serve under stop-loss orders 
since 2001, and making headway in ending 
the Disabled Veterans Tax and the Military 
Families’ Tax. 

Strengthened support for military families, 
building more military child care centers and 
better military family housing, and enacting 
landmark legislation to provide much-needed 
support for family members and other caregivers 
for wounded veterans. 

Added $23 billion for veteran’s health care 
and services, and accomplished a 60% increase 
in VA discretionary spending between 
2007 and 2010. 


E1532 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks November 12, 2014 

Secured advance appropriations for the Veterans 
Administration for the first time—creating 
an uninterrupted source of funding for 
medical care for veterans. 

The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus 
Health Services Act helped veteran caregivers 
with training, access to mental health counseling, 
and 24-hour respite care in veteran’s 
homes. 

1. The law helped veterans of Operation Enduring 
Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom 
by allowing them to select a caregiver who 
would receive a financial stipend along with 
travel and lodging expenses associated with 
the veteran’s care. 
2. This law also expanded and improved 
services for the then 1.8 million women veterans, 
and provided for the expected increased 
number of veterans that would transition 
from active duty to civilian life. 
3. The law authorized the VA to provide 
healthcare for newborn infants of women veterans. 
It is important that we preserve and build 
upon this record of achievement. 

Veteran homelessness was addressed in 
the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 
2008 by increasing the VA loan limit which 
helped veterans with refinancing their homes 
by making low-interest home loans more available 
to veterans. 

Mr. Speaker, all members of this body were 
deeply concerned over the troubling disclosures 
reported in the media regarding conditions 
as some of the nation’s VA facilities. 

I am pleased to report that the Department 
of Veterans Affairs, at the direction of President 
Obama and mandated by Congress, has 
made substantial progress in improving the 
performance of VHA healthcare now, developing 
a positive service culture, transitioning 
from ‘‘sick care’’ to ‘‘health care’’ in the broadest 
sense, and developing agile business systems 
and management processes that are efficient, 
transparent and accountable. 

For example, The ‘‘Road to Veterans Day’’ 
initiative, launched on September 8, 2014 by 
Secretary Robert A. McDonald, has resulted in 
significant progress for Veterans over the past 
3 months 

During that time, DVA has taken deliberate 
actions to improve service delivery for Veterans, 
rebuild trust, increase accountability 
and transparency and put the department on 
the path to long-term excellence and reform. 

Secretary McDonald has traveled extensively 
during his first few months in office, visiting 
41 DVA facilities in 21 cities while also 
making 11 recruiting visits to medical schools. 

To improve service delivery, VA has 
prioritized efforts to accelerate Veterans off of 
wait lists and into clinics through the Accelerated 
Care Initiative begun by Deputy Secretary 
Sloan Gibson this summer. 

Through this initiative, VA medical centers 
have increased access to care inside and outside 
of VA, added more clinic hours and work 
days, deployed mobile medical units, and 
shared their best practices from VA’s high-performing 
facilities throughout the organization. 

Significant improvements have resulted nationally: 


1. Scheduling more than 1.2 million more 
appointments in the past four months than in 
the same period last year. 
2. In total, VA medical centers have scheduled 
over 19 million Veteran appointments 
from June to October 1, 2014. 
3. Reducing the national new patient Primary 
Care wait time by 18 percent. 
4. Completing 98 percent of appointments 
within 30 days of the Veterans’ preferred date, 
or the date determined to be medically necessary 
by a physician. 
5. Authorizing 1.1 million non-VA care authorizations, 
a 47 percent increase over the 
same period last year. 
Secretary McDonald addressed all employees 
via Video Teleconference, where he directed 
each employee to reaffirm the mission 
and core values of the Department. 

A new award program has been initiated to 
highlight employees who truly embody DVA’s 
ICARE values—Integrity, Commitment, Advocacy, 
Respect, and Excellence. The first nominations 
for this new incentive program will be 
accepted in January 2015. 

Since June 2014, DVA has proposed disciplinary 
action against more than 40 employees 
nationwide related to data manipulation or 
patient care. 

DVA is also working diligently to cooperate 
with the over 100 investigations currently 
being undertaken by the VA Inspector General, 
the Justice Department, and the Office of 
Special Counsel (OSC). 

On October 3, OSC certified DVA under 
their Whistleblower Protection Certification 
Program after DVA worked to achieve compliance 
and protect employees who identify or 
report problems from unlawful retaliation. 

DVA also worked closely with OSC to successfully 
resolve whistleblower retaliation complaints 
filed by three individuals from the DVA 
Phoenix Health Care System. 

DVA has posted data online on a regular 
basis since the beginning of June showing the 
number of appointments on waiting lists and 
the average wait times at each medical center 
across the country. 

Additionally, each medical center and benefits 
office has conducted a town hall with Veterans 
and the public to collect feedback. 
These town halls will continue at each facility 
every three months. 

DVA is reviewing options to reorganize the 
department for success, guided by ideas and 
initiatives from Veterans, employees, and all of 
our stakeholders. 

This reorganization will be known as 
‘‘MyVA’’ and is designed to provide Veterans 
with a seamless, integrated, and responsive 
customer service experience—whether they 
arrive at VA digitally, by phone, or in person. 

Long-term reform of DVA also means making 
sure DVA has the medical professionals 
we need to best care for our patients, which 
is why Secretary McDonald launched a national 
recruiting effort in August, visiting medical 
schools in an effort to bring the best and 
brightest to work at DVA. 

On September 17, DVA announced an increase 
in the salary pay scale for DVA doctors 
and dentists to aid in recruiting and retention. 

As part of the ‘‘Road to Veterans Day,’’ Secretary 
McDonald has reaffirmed DVA’s homelessness 
program and the Veterans Benefits 
Administration’s Claims Transformation Strategy. 


DVA remains committed to working with its 
federal, state and local partners to end homelessness 
among Veterans, which has been reduced 
by 33% since 2010. 

With the backlog of disability claims reduced 
by 60% since its peak in March of 2013, DVA 
is also on track to eliminate the backlog in 

2015 and will continue to expand online claim-
submission capability in all programs. 

Mr. Speaker, as we honor and remember 
the sacrifices of the millions of veterans who 
have served our country throughout its history, 
let us always remember that the first obligation 
of a grateful is, as President Lincoln reminded 
us long ago, ‘‘to care for him who has borne 
the battle, and for his widow and his orphan, 
to do all which may achieve and cherish a just 
and lasting peace among ourselves and with 
all nations.’’

IN RECOGNITION OF AMERICAN 
VALOR AT THE BATTLE OF THE 
BULGE AND THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE PATTON PRAYER 
CARDS 

HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor and remember the bravery of American 
troops who fought in the Battle of the Bulge 
and to recall the unique prayer cards General 
George Patton distributed to his Third Army in 
December 1944. The prayer, which asked for 
favorable weather, was printed on the back of 
a Christmas greeting from General Patton. 
The troops received these prayer cards prior 
to the Battle of the Bulge. 

The incident of the now famous Patton 
Prayer commenced with a telephone call to 
the Third Army Chaplain on the morning of 
December 8, 1944. After weeks of severe 
rains that threatened the prospects of victory, 
General Patton called to ask Msgr. James H. 
O’Neill if he knew a prayer for good weather. 
While looking out on the steadily falling rain, 
the chaplain wrote an original prayer alongside 
a Christmas greeting, and then had it circulated 
it to all 250,000 Third Army troops on 
the eve of the Battle of the Bulge. 

The prayer, in part, read: ‘‘Almighty and 
most merciful Father, we humbly beseech 
Thee, of Thy great goodness, to restrain these 
immoderate rains with which we have had to 
contend. Grant us fair weather for Battle. Graciously 
hearken to us as soldiers who call 
upon Thee that, armed with Thy power, we 
may advance from victory to victory . . .’’ 

The Battle of the Bulge, one of World War 
II’s most critical battles, started when Nazi 
forces launched a major surprise offensive on 
December 16. Fought among the dense forests 
bordering Belgium and Luxembourg, it 
was the bloodiest battle the U.S. encountered 
during the World War II, with over 18,000 
Americans killed and over 65,000 captured or 
injured. The heavy rains and thick fog eventually 
subsided, and Allied forces were able to 
hold off Nazi forces and severely deplete their 
resource supply. The Battle of the Bulge is 
symbolic of the resilience and strength of 
American soldiers, who were unyielding in the 
face of both enemy fire and debilitating weather. 
After the Battle, General Patton told Msgr. 
O’Neill that ‘‘our prayers worked.’’ To General 
Patton, prayer was just as powerful a weapon 
of war and as defense and attack strategies. 

It is an honor for me to commemorate the 
valor of these American soldiers, the leadership 
of General Patton, and the ultimate victory 
of the ‘‘Greatest Generation.’’

IN RECOGNITION OF THE HONORABLE 
LAWRENCE M. LAWSON 

HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the outstanding achievements of the 
Honorable Lawrence M. Lawson and congratulate 
him on his recent retirement as Monmouth 
Vicinage Assignment Judge. Judge 
Lawson has served honorably, breaking barriers 
and serving as an example for younger 
generations. 

Judge Lawson received his undergraduate 
degree at Bowie State College (now Bowie 
State University) and his Juris Doctor from 
The Catholic University of America Columbus 
School of Law. Prior to enrolling at The Catholic 
University, Judge Lawson completed the 
Council in Legal Education Opportunity 
(CLEO) Program and earned a 3-year scholarship 
for law school. 

Judge Lawson’s judicial experience began 
after he graduated from law school. In 1972, 
he worked as a law clerk for the late Honorable 
Thomas L. Yaccarino in Monmouth County, 
and was the first black law clerk to work in 
the Freehold court house. He was nominated 
as a Monmouth County judge by Governor 
Tom Kean in 1987 and was appointed to Assignment 
Judge on April 15, 1993, serving as 
the first black assignment judge. Early in his 
career, Judge Lawson served in the Civil Division 
and the Criminal Division, eventually 
serving as the Presiding Judge of the Criminal 
Division. With this assignment, Judge Lawson 
became the first black judge of a division of 
the court system. Judge Lawson retired as Assignment 
Judge on September 1, 2014. 

In addition to his judicial service, Judge 
Lawson worked for the New Jersey Department 
of Community Affairs State Office of 
Legal Services, held a general law practice in 
Asbury Park for 12 years, worked as the As-
bury Park Municipal Prosecutor, the Neptune 
Township Board of Adjustment Attorney and 
served as a delegate at the 1980 Democratic 
National Convention and the 1984 Democratic 
National Convention for Ted Kennedy and 
Walter Mondale, respectively. Judge Lawson 
also served on the Neptune Township committee 
and was elected mayor in 1984, serving 
as the first black mayor of the township. 

Judge Lawson is also an active member of 
his community. He has coached a midnight 
basketball team, volunteered as a mentor at 
Second Baptist Church and worked with the 
United Fellowship men’s program. Through his 
background and community outreach, Judge 
Lawson has motivated the community’s youth 
to strive for success. 

Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope that my colleagues 
will join me in congratulating the Honorable 
Lawrence Lawson on his retirement 
and thanking him for his service. Judge 
Lawson dedicated nearly 30 years to the 
bench and his contributions and achievements 
are truly deserving of this body’s recognition. 

RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBU


TIONS OF IZADELI ‘‘IZA’’ 

MONTALVO VA´ ZQUEZ 

HON. ALAN GRAYSON 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, in 
honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, to recognize 
Izadeli ‘‘Iza’’ Montalvo Va´zquez. Iza was 
born in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, and was 
raised in the town of Sabana Grande. From a 
very early age, she demonstrated a gift for poetry 
and by the age of seven, she wrote her 
first poem. Her love for writing was inherited 
from her uncle, Emilio Forestier Gregory, a 
lawyer and published poet in Puerto Rico. 

Her parents, both public school teachers, 
encouraged her to get involved in the community. 
She started writing theatrical plays for her 
school to bring awareness to different topics 
and to raise funds for student clubs. In middle 
school, she founded the student’s newspaper, 
‘‘Eco Estudiantil.’’ Iza was an honor student 
throughout her school years. At the age of 14, 
she started playing professional volleyball. In 
her senior year of high school, she was offered 
a scholarship to play for the InterAmerican 
University of Puerto Rico’s volleyball 
team. The Puerto Rican Volleyball Federation 
also signed her to join Las Leonas de Ponce. 

In college, Iza continued to follow her passion 
for writing by joining the Jose´ Gautier 
Beni´tez literature club, where she received numerous 
awards for her poetry. She also 
earned third place in a poetry competition 
where film director, Jacobo Morales, served as 
the judge. 

In 1998, Iza moved to New York City. She 
continued her undergraduate studies at St. 
John’s University in Queens, where she graduated 
with a Bachelor of Science degree in 
Journalism in 2001. During that time, she interned 
at Univisio´n 41 in New Jersey and at 
El Diario La Prensa, where she was hired to 
work as reporter. She has reported about the 
protests at the United Nations against the 
Navy’s presence on the island of Vieques, 
protests in Times Square against the War in 
Iraq, the World Economic Forum, the aftermath 
of September 11th, Abner Louima and 
Amadou Diallo’s police brutality cases, and 
dozens of homicides. 

In 2004, Iza moved to Orlando to work as 
a reporter for El Nuevo Di´a Orlando, part of 
Puerto Rico’s largest daily newspaper. Her 
work has been published in newspapers including 
Caribbean Business, El Nuevo Di´a in 
Puerto Rico, La Prensa in Panama´, La 
Opinio´n, La Raza and El Mensajero. 

Iza has also worked as a reporter for The 
Ledger, a company owned at the time by The 
New York Times Regional Newspaper Group. 
There she covered immigration and other topics 
of interest to the Hispanic community. In 
Florida, Iza reported on the 2004 Atlantic Hurricane 
Season, the NBA’s All-Star Game in 
Orlando, and the 2012 presidential and local 
elections, among other stories. Iza has conducted 
many interviews, including one with 
Jose Me´lendez Pe´rez, the U.S. Customs and 
Border Patrol Protection Inspector at the Orlando 
International Airport who became a key 
national figure when he refused entry to a terrorist 
involved in planning the 9/11 attacks. As 
a TV producer, she arranged an exclusive 

interview with Joseph Acaba, the first person 
of Puerto Rican heritage to be named as a 
NASA astronaut candidate. 

Iza’s professional experience also includes 
working as a producer for Univisio´n WVEN TV 
26 in Altamonte Springs and as my press secretary 
during 2013. She has been a member 
of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists 
(NAHJ) since 2001, and she was recently 
named honorary godmother of the International 
Association of Writers and Poets 
(AIPEH). At age 39, Iza became the editor in 
chief of La Prensa, Central Florida’s oldest 
Spanish language newspaper. La Prensa is 
owned by ImpreMedia, the leading Hispanic 
news and information company in the U.S. 

I am happy to recognize Iza Montalvo 
Va´zquez, during Hispanic Heritage Month, for 
her contributions to the Central Florida community.

HONORING DR. TALMADGE 
WILLIAMS 

HON. JAMES P. MORAN 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor my friend Dr. Talmadge Williams. He 
was a man of consequence who forever 
strived to restore balance to the scales of justice, 
whether it was ensuring that our government 
committed to telling the full story, or 
making sure someone he knew had a fair shot 
at success. And he was my friend. 

I am not exactly sure when our paths first 
crossed, but Talmadge had a way of growing 
on you. As a local elected official, particularly 
in my early years of service, I was out almost 
every night at a different event, connecting 
with communities and constituents I represented, 
first at City Hall in Alexandria and 
subsequently in Congress. 

Somewhere among the meetings and 
events I saw Talmadge as a familiar face and 
in a short while we would seek each other out 
and discuss local issues of concern. His quiet 
demeanor and keen insight made him an indispensable 
ally and a trusted friend. 

He always seemed to know more about a 
local issue than what was common knowledge, 
and in sharing it with me, he opened my 
eyes to a narrative and a perspective that was 
largely unknown. 

It was more than just folklore; it was history 
that was still unwritten but needed to be. And, 
there was often a reason it went unrecorded 
and remained unwritten. It was part of a painful 
truth that too many, particularly those in 
power, found inconvenient or uncomfortable to 
acknowledge. 

Well, Talmadge’s sense of justice wouldn’t 
let it stand and a great deal of his life was devoted 
to finding ways to tell the full story. 

One monumental way he found to tell the 
full story was when he conceived the idea of 
building in Arlington The Black Heritage Museum. 
It was a vision I am pleased to be associated 
with through congressional legislation 
I helped pass that reserved a segment of the 
Navy Annex site for the future museum. 

But, Talmadge was not one to pass up on 
other opportunities and I was proud to join 
with him in restoring the surviving slave quarters 
at Robert E. Lee’s Arlington House. You 


E1534 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks November 12, 2014 

see, before Talmadge made it an issue, the 
Park Service was using the two surviving 
slave quarters as a storage facility, erasing the 
significance of these two buildings and the 
story of slavery at Arlington House. 

It is not uncommon to find some of Virginia’s 
historic plantations beautifully restored, 
but with all traces of its slave history removed, 
as if that peculiar institution never existed. We 
could not undo what these owners did to 
erase the vestiges of slavery from their 
grounds, but we were not going to let the National 
Park Service get away with it. 

I made sure the Park Service had the funds 
and the instructions from Congress to restore 
the slave quarters. 

Today, Talmadge’s work is now on display 
at Arlington House. When Talmadge made his 
point, it had a lasting effect. 

While I was on the Legislative Branch Appropriations 
Subcommittee I made sure the 
history of the U.S. Capitol acknowledged the 
sweat and blood of the slaves who built it. 
Today, in the Capitol’s new visitor center there 
is a memorial dedicated to the slaves who 
built the nation’s house of democracy. For me, 
this memorial also honors my friend Talmadge 
Williams. 

While we have faced some setbacks on acquiring 
the land for the Black Heritage Museum, 
I have no doubt it will be built. 

You see, Talmadge is recruiting new allies 
in heaven to aid the cause. Though I am saddened 
by his death, I rejoice in knowing that 
Talmadge has transformed those around him 
directing us to a better, more just tomorrow. 

He is a man who dared to make a difference, 
and I am so ever grateful I am among 
those he touched.

HONORING MS. CHERISSE 
MARSHALL 

HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 

OF MISSISSIPPI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor a remarkable Entrepreneur 
Ms. Cherisse Marshall from Lexington, 
Mississippi. 

Cherisse Marshall was born in Chicago, IL 
and at an early age her parents moved to 
Flint, Michigan along with her other five siblings. 
She was raised in Flint, MI where she 
attended school. After graduating from high 
school, she later attended Ferris State University 
where she studied journalism. After graduating 
from Ferris State University, she later 
entered into the corporate world in an administrative 
support role that would be the beginning 
of a long rewarding career in administration. 


After a few years of working at home in 
Flint, MI, she decided to relocate to Atlanta, 
Georgia where she continued to tune and develop 
her administrative expertise. 

As a detail-oriented, results-oriented professional, 
she has effectively utilized her diverse 
skills to benefit companies in the engineering, 
financial, insurance, information technology, 
and advertising industries. Throughout her corporate 
career that spans over 17 years, she 
has provided diverse administrative support in 
the areas of office administration, customer 
support, contract administration, problem reso


lution, information technology, project management, 
as well as everyday administrative support. 


She later relocated to Lexington, Mississippi 
where she created OfficeStar Administrative 
Consulting, LLC to provide the same administrative 
expertise to entrepreneurs and small 
businesses to help them focus on growing 
their business instead of worrying about everyday 
administrative tasks. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing an amazing entrepreneur for 
her dedication and service to her profession.

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Major Sarai Martin on 
the occasion of his retirement after 22 years of 
service in the United States Army. 

Major Martin’s distinguished military career 
began as a Private at Fort Benning, Georgia 
when he was only 17 years old. He served assignments 
throughout the United States and 
abroad as an enlisted Soldier, Non-Commissioned 
Officer and Commissioned Officer as 
well as enduring deployments to both Bosnia

Throughout his career, Major Martin continued 
to improve himself and rise through the 
ranks. After earning a college degree, Major 
Martin was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. 
He served in positions as varied as 
Company Commander for an Ordinance Company, 
a Military Transition Team advisor in 
Iraq, and eventually rose to become the Mobilization

We owe Major Martin a debt of gratitude for 
his selfless devotion and years of service to 

our nation. It is my true honor and privilege to

career, and I offer him my best wishes 
for continued good health and success in 
the years to come.

HONORABLE PATRICK J. ROMA 

HON. BILL PASCRELL, Jr. 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the Honorable Patrick J. Roma who 
was celebrated in October for his retirement 
from judicial service by his friends, family, and 
coworkers. He retires after a long career in 
which he faithfully upheld New Jersey’s Constitution. 


The Honorable Patrick J. Roma received his 
undergraduate degree from Seton Hall University 
in 1971. He later received his law degree 
from Samford University’s Cumberland School 
of Law in 1975 and his L.L.M. Degree from 
New York University School of Law in 1981. 

Early in Judge Roma’s legal career, he 
worked as the late Judge John J. Cariddi’s 
Law Secretary in the Superior Court of New 
Jersey. Judge Roma then went on to work at 
Friedman, Pearlman & Roma, P.C. where he 
worked as an attorney for over two decades. 
During this time, he also served as Prosecutor 
for the Boroughs of Palisades Park, Fairview, 
Little Ferry, Saddle Brook, Haworth, and 
Leonia. 

During his time as Partner at Friedman, 
Pearlman & Roma, P.C., Judge Roma was 
elected as Council President and Police Commissioner 
for the Borough of Palisades Park. 
He served from January 1985 through December 
1987. Thereafter, Judge Roma was elected 
as New Jersey’s District 38 General Assemblyman 
from 1988 through 1997 during 
which time he served as Assistant Minority 
Whip and Assistant Minority Leader. 

As an Assemblyman, Judge Roma received 
a number of awards. He was awarded Legislator 
of the Year by Local 518 the Motor Vehicle 
Employees Union in 1993, and Shelter Our 
Sisters and the Italian American Police Society 
both in 1994, as well as, Man of the Year by 
New Jersey AFL–CIO in 1995 and Parole Officers 
Association in 1991. 

Judge Roma received a Distinguished Service 
Award presented by Consul General Franco 
Mistretta, on behalf of the Italian Government, 
in recognition of his outstanding contribution 
and dedicated service to the Italian-
American community from Ambassador Boris 
Biancheri, Ambassador of Italy to the United 
States. 

Judge Roma was appointed in 1997 to the 
Superior Court of New Jersey by Governor 
Christie Todd Whitman and reappointed with 
tenure in 2003 by Governor James McGreevy. 
He has served on the bench in the Criminal 
Division of the Bergen Vicinage. 

Having served alongside Judge Roma in the 
State Assembly, I know personally of his dedicated 
and hardworking nature. Judge Roma 
has made an outstanding mark on Bergen 
County with his compassionate nature and 
passion for upholding justice. 

The job of a United States Congressman involves 
much that is rewarding, yet nothing 
compares to recognizing and commemorating

the achievements of individuals like the Honorable 
Patrick J. Roma. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, 
Judge Roma’s family, friends, coworkers, 
and all those whose lives he has 
touched, and me, in recognizing the Honorable 
Patrick J. Roma.

HONORING FRED T. NOLAN 

HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 

OF MISSISSIPPI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor a remarkable public 
servant, Mr. Fred T. Nolan, a native of Dyer, 
Tennessee, but raised in Paducah, Kentucky, 
and has lived in Jackson, Mississippi since his 
graduation from Tougaloo College in the early 
1960s. 

One of his early career choices was teaching 
in the Jackson Public School District 
(JPS). Mr. Nolan taught two years at the then 
Brinkley High School located on Livingston 
Road and was a ninth grade teacher of Social 
Studies and Mathematics. He left JPS to pursue 
other career options and worked briefly for 
the Urban League of Jackson as director. The 
majority of his career spanned 25 years as the 
executive director of Fair Housing and Equal 
Opportunity, a division of Housing Urban Development 
(HUD). 

After fully retiring from HUD in 1996, Mr. 
Nolan rejoined the JPS family as a substitute 
and limited service teacher. He worked three 
years in a limited service capacity at Siwell 
Middle, Lanier High, and Forest Hill High 
schools. 

Mr. Fred Nolan is married to Mrs. Kisiah 
Nolan, a former JPS Board member and president. 
His son, Fredrick Nolan, is coordinator of 
the JPS WATCH D.O.G.S. program. The 
Nolan’s also have two daughters: Renee 
Nolan Johnson of Huntsville, Alabama, and 
Adrienne Nolan Colar of Smyrna, Georgia. All 
three of their children are graduates of the 
Jackson Public School District. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing Mr. Fred T. Nolan for his dedication 
to serving others.

IN HONOR OF CHIEF BENNY G. 
BENAVIDEZ 

HON. JUAN VARGAS 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Chief Benny G. Benavidez for his 
outstanding and invaluable service to the Imperial 
County community and to congratulate 
him on his retirement. Throughout his 37-year 
public service career, Chief Benavidez exhibited 
dedication to the Imperial County Probation 
Department’s staff and clients, while keeping 
a steadfast commitment to improving services 
in Imperial County. 

Chief Benavidez began his career in Imperial 
County Probation as a Juvenile Hall Officer 
in the 1970s. During his career, he served 
in many capacities for the Imperial County 
Probation Department and the California De


partment of Corrections and Rehabilitation. In 
his leadership position at the Imperial County 
Probation Department, Chief Benavidez practiced 
and preached ethical conduct, professionalism, 
knowledge, loyalty and evidence-
based practices. He also created a new mission 
statement that embodies the driving force 
and tempo for all officers, enhanced officer 
training, established the Day Reporting Center, 
a one stop shop for services and referrals, 
improved Juvenile Hall Medical Services and 
brought a wealth of resources to the area 
through his collaborative efforts. 

Chief Benavidez was heavily involved in the 
community he served. He routinely attended 
Imperial County Board of Supervisors meetings, 
Law Enforcement Coordination Council 
meetings, Community Corrections Partnership 
meetings and local events designed to bring 
awareness to the resources available in the 
community to reduce recidivism, motivate behavioral 
change and advocate for victims. With 
a degree in Criminal Justice Administration 
from San Diego State University, Chief 
Benavidez continues to be a valuable asset to 
the Imperial Valley College faculty as a Correctional 
Science instructor.

TRIBUTE TO GEORGIA MILITARY 
COLLEGE 

HON. PAUL C. BROUN 

OF GEORGIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. BROUN of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Georgia Military College 
as it celebrates its 135th anniversary. I take 
great pride in representing this historic institution, 
comprised of a junior college and a separate 
preparatory school, located in scenic 
Milledgeville, Georgia. 

Once the site of the Georgia state capitol, 
GMC now is one of only five United States 
Military Junior Colleges. At the center of its 
main campus stands the Old Capitol Building 
where the Georgia General Assembly met 
from 1807 until 1868 before the capital was 
moved to Atlanta. As President Emeritus 
Major General Peter J. Boylan has highlighted, 
‘‘It was on the parade on the east plaza that 
every soldier from Georgia marched before 
going off to defend our values in war . . . the 
War of 1812, the Indian Wars, the War with 
Mexico, and, of course, the Civil War.’’ In light 
of this rich history, it is fitting that the institution’s 
core values are that of Duty, Honor, and 
Country. 

What began in 1879 as Middle Georgia Military 
and Agricultural College with just 219 students 
has flourished into an institution with 
more than 12,000 students enrolled online or 
at one of its nine campus locations. Nationally 
recognized as one of the best community colleges, 
GMC is producing accomplished and 
well-rounded individuals. It has a highly regarded 
junior college cadet program that culminates 
at the end of two years of study with 
a select few men and women being commissioned 
as officers in the United States Army. 
Additionally, it boasts such prestigious graduates 
as Georgia Governor George Busbee, 
Coach Bill Yoast of ‘‘Remember the Titans,’’ 

U.S. Secretary of Labor W.J. Usery, and comedian 
and actor Oliver Hardy. Its alumni include 
judges, artists, educators, inventors, 
doctors, aviation pioneers, and thousands of 
men and women who have served in uniform. 

For this reason, and on the occasion of its 
anniversary, it is my honor to acknowledge the 
educational leadership of this remarkable institution, 
under the direction of Lieutenant General 
William B. Caldwell, IV. Furthermore, I extend 
my sincere appreciation to the entire 
Georgia Military College community—students, 
staff, faculty, alumni, and supporters—for the 
contributions they have made for more than a 
century to Georgia and beyond.

THE INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO 
PROHIBIT TAX-EXEMPT STATUS 
TO PROFESSIONAL SPORTS 
LEAGUES THAT PROMOTE THE 
USE OF THE TERM REDSKINS 

HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 

OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce 
a bill that would amend section 501 of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prohibit 
tax-exempt status to professional sports 
leagues that promote or allow a member club 
or franchise connected to that league to promote 
the use of the term ‘‘Redskins.’’ Senator 
MARIA CANTWELL has introduced the same bill 
in the Senate. 

Currently, the National Football League 
(NFL) is a not-for-profit 501(c)(6) ‘‘business 
league’’ organization that receives tax-exempt 
status. It is the nation’s largest sports franchise, 
generating almost $10 billion annually. 
Unlike some of its counterparts—the National 
Basketball Association and Major League 
Baseball, for example—it operates as a nonprofit, 
which allows for its profits to trickle 
down to its 32 teams, including the Washington 
football team. 

Over 300 tribes and two million Native 
Americans, as well as religious and human 
rights organizations, have called on NFL Commissioner 
Roger Goodell and Daniel Snyder, 
the Washington football team owner, to 
change the name of the Washington football 
team because the name and mascot insult native 
people. In addition, several media outlets 
around the country no longer print or use the 
term ‘‘Redskins’’ when referring to the Washington 
football team because the term is offensive. 


On June 18, the United States Patent and 
Trademark Office, in a landmark decision 
(Blackhorse v. Pro Football, Inc.), found the 
name used by the Washington football team to 
be disparaging to Native Americans and not 
deserving of trademark protection, and can-
celled federal trademark protection for the 
‘‘Redskins’’ trademarks. While the ruling did 
not persuade Daniel Snyder or Roger Goodell 
to change the name, the ruling has the potential 
to affect the profits received from the sale 
of the team’s merchandise. 

American taxpayers have been subsidizing 
a multibillion dollar league that promotes what 
has now been officially found to be a racial 
slur for profitable gain. Relief from taxes 
should no longer be given to a league that 
profits from the continued use of a racial slur, 
which degrades some Americans. As an organization 
that enjoys tax-exempt benefits, the 
NFL also has a duty to American taxpayers to 


E1536 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks November 12, 2014 

ensure that its teams are not promoting or 
benefitting from a racial slur. This bill would 
revoke the tax-exempt status of professional 
sports leagues that choose to continue to use 
the offensive and derogatory term ‘‘Redskins.’’ 

Because this bill only revokes the tax-exempt 
status of leagues that promote the use 
of the term ‘‘Redskins,’’ it would not affect 
other leagues that fall under the same 
501(c)(6) tax exemption such as the Professional 
Golfers Association and the National 
Hockey League. 

I urge my colleagues to support this important 
legislation.

REMEMBERING PAUL G. (JERRY) 
GOFORTH 

HON. PAUL COOK 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Paul G. (Jerry) Goforth who 
passed away on October 3, 2014. Jerry, a 
family man, United States Marine, and a 
horseman will be remembered as a compassionate 
and respectful man who provided unconditionally 
for his family. 

Jerry enlisted in the United States Marine 
Corps Second Division, in 1943 and served 
over two years in the Pacific Theatre. 

After leaving the USMC, Jerry made Southern 
California home where he fell in love with 
his wife Barbara (Bobbie) Baylis. Together 
they married in 1948 and raised a family. 

Jerry was a distinguished member of the 
Long Beach Police Department as a motor officer. 
After an accident that prematurely ended 
Jerry’s career, he joined the team at State 
Farm in Costa Mesa as a claims superintendent. 


Retiring after twenty-five years, Jerry and 
Bobbie built their dream home and moved to 
my hometown of Yucca Valley. 

I can remember Jerry and Bobbie traveling 
at every opportunity they had. Either abroad or 
in their motor-home, they loved the chance to 
see old friends and make new ones. Jerry 
raised Arabian horses, leather tooled, and restored 
antique factors. 

Jerry was a member of the California Chapter 
of the Second Marine Division Association. 
He was devoted to promoting the tenets of the 
association and served as both President of 
the California and National Associations.

RECOGNIZING THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF LIONVILLE NATURAL 
PHARMACY OF CHESTER COUNTY, 
PENNSYLVANIA 

HON. JIM GERLACH 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. GERLACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Lionville Natural Pharmacy of Chester 
County, Pennsylvania on the occasion of 
its 35th Anniversary. 

After graduating from Philadelphia College 
of Pharmacy in 1973, Ben Briggs, RPh, CNC, 

IACP, began his career as a retail pharmacist 
and founded Lionville Pharmacy in 1979. 
While the store was originally located in the 
Medical Arts Building on Route 100, it moved 
in 1987 to a larger location on Route 113 and 
Whitford Road, and then finally to its current 
location in 1992 at Route 113 and Gordon 
Drive. In 1996, the store was renamed 
Lionville Natural Pharmacy and Health Food 
Store. In 1999, upon his graduation from the 
University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, 
Ben’s son, Michael, Pharm.D., CNC, also 
joined the practice. 

Over the years, Lionville Natural Pharmacy 
added a compounding pharmacy lab and a 
holistic health center offering therapeutic massage, 
acupuncture, shiatsu, and more. 
Throughout its long and storied history, 
Lionville Natural Pharmacy has been featured 
in numerous newspaper and magazine articles, 
including Best of the Main Line in Main 
Line Today from 2006 to 2014. 

Mr. Speaker, in recognition of its 35 years of 
faithful service to its patients and customers, 
along with its outstanding history of commitment 
to the life and health of the Chester 
County community and its citizens, I ask my 
colleagues to join me today in recognizing 
Lionville Natural Pharmacy of Chester County, 
Pennsylvania on the occasion of its 35th Anniversary.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 175TH AN


NIVERSARY OF THE TEMPLE 

COVENANT OF PEACE 

HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor the 175th anniversary of the Temple 
Covenant of Peace. They are the third oldest 
Temple in Pennsylvania and the tenth oldest 
in the United States. Committed to a mission 
of cultivating a love and understanding of Jewish 
heritage and to inspiring fellowship in the 
Jewish Community, they have offered many 
avenues for service to the larger community. 
Their history is intertwined with the history of 
the City of Easton, Pennsylvania. 

Founded on August 26, 1839, the Congregation 
Brith Sholom (Covenant of Peace) 
held their services in a rented space on Third 
and Bank Street in Easton. As they grew, they 
endeavored to build a synagogue on Sixth 
Street between Pine and Ferry. Its fac¸ade mirrored 
that of a great synagogue in Florence, 
Italy. Until 1959, it was the oldest synagogue 
in continuous use, for 117 years, in the United 
States. In 1954, the Covenant of Peace purchased 
property to build a new synagogue for 
their growing congregation. This synagogue 
was dedicated on November 20, 1959. The 
synagogue was built with no work performed 
on the Sabbath or on Jewish holidays. The 
Temple Covenant of Peace has what is believed 
to be one of the first free-standing 
monuments to the victims of the Holocaust. 

Through the years, members of the Temple 
Covenant of Peace have served the Easton 
community well. The Rabbis and members 
have served on the boards of community non-
profits and similar organizations. They have 
organized food drives and participated in community 
dialogues on faith and the ethical 

issues of our day. They have stood with members 
of the community to help them grieve 
times of loss and to offer courage in times of 
change. 

It is my honor to commend the Temple Covenant 
of Peace and their commitment to cultivating 
a love and understanding of the Jewish 
heritage and to inspiring fellowship in the Jewish 
Community as well as service in the 
broader community in the Easton area.

HONORING COLONEL ANDREW J. 
FRANK 

HON. F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER, JR. 

OF WISCONSIN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Colonel Andrew J. 
Frank who retired after 36 years of faithful 
service in the United States Army on September 
30, 2014. As a fitting finale to his long 
and distinguished career, on July 28, 2014, 
Colonel Frank was awarded the National Intelligence 
Medal for Valor in recognition of his 
extraordinary heroism while serving in Afghanistan 
in support of Operation ENDURING 
FREEDOM. As the Intelligence Community’s 
second highest award, the National Intelligence 
Medal for Valor recognizes only the 
most exceptional acts of courage in the pursuit 
of intelligence community and national security 
objectives. 

On the occasion of Colonel Frank’s retirement 
to my home-state of Wisconsin, I would 
like to take a moment to underscore his heroic 
actions to the House. 

On March 20, 2008, while serving as the 
Defense Intelligence Agency’s Chief of the Defense 
Intelligence Support Organization in Afghanistan, 
Colonel Frank displayed unflinching 
leadership and bravery leading security activities 
for an inter-agency intelligence task force. 
Caught in an ambush by a numerically superior 
enemy force with a marked tactical advantage, 
Colonel Frank courageously disregarded 
his own safety, maneuvering through multiple 
kill zones over open terrain, on no less than 
seven occasions, to save the lives of his 
teammates, coalition soldiers, and civilian bystanders. 
He personally led the fire and maneuver 
of his team, rallied the Afghan National 
Police (ANP) to engage enemy forces, and 
heroically retrieved a critical resupply of ammunition 
desperately needed by his team. 
Colonel Frank’s uncommon valor and determined 
leadership allowed his three-member 
team, trapped in two ambushes for over two 
and one half hours, to neutralize the enemy 
without a single loss of U.S. or ANP life. Colonel 
Frank’s bravery under fire is in keeping 
with the finest traditions of military service and 
reflects great credit upon himself, the Defense 
Intelligence Agency, and the United States Intelligence 
Community. 

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful Nation 
and my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
I would like to express my sincere 
thanks to Andrew and his family for their 
many years of faithful service and a job very 
well done. I wish them years of good fortune 
as they enjoy their retirement from military 
service in Wisconsin.

LIC OF CHINA’S (TAIWAN) 103RD 

NATIONAL DAY 

HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 

OF FLORIDA

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to recognize Taiwan’s 103rd National 
Day on October 10, 2014. This event 
marks the anniversary of the 1911 uprising 
that led to the establishment of the Republic of 
China. 

As my colleagues know, the U.S.-Taiwan relationship 
is a warm one, cemented by our 
shared commitments to democracy and free 
enterprise. This stands in contrast to Taiwan’s 
unique political status in the international community, 
which too often leaves it shut out of 
the world’s deliberations. All across the globe 
today, we see new and emerging threats of 
rare complexity, the solutions to which would 
benefit greatly from Taiwan’s participation at 
the negotiating table. 

I ask that my colleagues join me in redoubling 
our efforts to secure meaningful participation, 
wherever possible, for Taiwan in the 
work of international and multilateral organizations. 
As we work toward that end, I once 
again join my colleagues in wishing our Taiwanese 
friends all the best as they commemorate 
this momentous day.

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
would like to proudly acknowledge the many 
accomplishments of Ahmed Mazaheri, M.D. 
and his contributions to the local and global 
community. He recently was recognized by 
Rotary Club International and the Rotary Club 
of Doylestown with its ‘‘50 Years of Service 
Award.’’ Dr. Mazaheri retired from medical 
practice in 1994 and, with his generous spirit, 
devoted his time to community and international 
service, particularly through the Rotary 
Club of Doylestown and service on various 
county health and educational associations. 
Dr. Mazaheri, a native of Iran, left his 
country at age 18 to study medicine at the 
University of Bonn and the University of London 
and later, medical residencies at Georgetown 
University and Pennsylvania Hospital. 
Prior to 1961, he was a medical liaison for the 

U.S. Army in Germany. We sincerely congratulate 
him for selfless dedication and devotion 
to the health and well-being of the greater 
community and grateful that he has reached 
out to so many others. In so doing, Dr. 
Mazaheri has set an outstanding example for 
others to follow. 
CELEBRATING VIVIAN L. WOOD 

HON. JOHN R. CARTER 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. CARTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the extraordinary service of 
Williamson County Treasurer Vivian L. Wood 
as she begins the next exciting chapter of her 
life. Recognizing the importance of allowing a 
new generation of leaders a chance to make 
a positive impact, Vivian is stepping down 
from her two decades of dedication to making 
Williamson County a great place to live and 
work. 

Under Vivian’s stewardship, Williamson 
County has enjoyed tremendous population 
and job growth while the rest of the nation 
was still recovering from recent economic 
challenges. As the fastest growing county in 
the USA from 2010 through 2012, Williamson 
County is home to Dell Computers, cutting 
edge medical centers, and thriving small businesses. 
Vivian’s forward-thinking financial 
management has been critical to the county’s 
continuing success. 

Widely admired and respected for her leadership, 
Vivian has been a treasurer both her 
colleagues and constituents could rely upon. 
Her commitment to public service doesn’t end 
when she leaves the office. Vivian has served 
in all offices of the County Treasurers Association 
of Texas since 1996 and has received 
numerous awards for her dedication to excellence. 


Vivian’s extraordinary commitment to service 
reflects the best values of Central Texas. 
She’s positively impacted the lives of thousands 
and there’s no doubt that Williamson 
County is a better place because of her. 

Retirement is to be celebrated and enjoyed. 
It is not the end of a career, but rather the beginning 
of a new adventure. I commend Vivian 
Wood for her selfless service to her beloved 
community and wish her only the best in the 
years ahead.

Nevada under the Save Mart, S-Mart Foods, 
Lucky, and FoodMaxx banners. A privately-
owned retail food company, it is sustained by 
a familial corporate culture. The company has 
always believed in supporting local suppliers 
and producers, and is actively engaged with 
the charities and causes of the communities 
where its stores do business. 

Their long history began when the first Save 
Mart opened in Modesto, California on January 
17, 1952. Over the next four decades, 

many changes took place. Long known for innovation, 
Save Mart was one of the first supermarkets 
to offer customers pre-packaged 
meats, yard and garden supplies, plants, 
fresh-cut flowers and gift items, all creative 
concepts for the 1950s, and relatively unheard 
of for the area until Save Mart introduced 
them. In 1984, major growth occurred for Save 
Mart Supermarkets with the opening of eight 
new stores and a new partnership established 
to produce Sunnyside Farms dairy products. 
The company expanded throughout the 1980s 
including the acquisition of twenty-seven Fry’s 
supermarkets located in the East Bay area in 
1989; 1997 saw the acquisition of 10 Lucky 
stores in the Central Valley. 

With their success, the company developed 
its own warehouse concept under the name 
FoodMaxx, which it owns independently. In 
2003, Save Mart Supermarkets acquired 25 
Food 4 Less stores and rebranded them 
FoodMaxx. The FoodMaxx division is now 50 
stores strong. 

Still growing, in 2007 Save Mart Supermarkets 
acquired Albertsons stores in the 
Metro Sacramento area, San Francisco Bay 
Area, and Northern Nevada, and converted 
them to Lucky and Save Mart stores. Today, 
the company operates stores throughout the 
Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, and 
Northern Nevada. 

Save Mart Supermarkets is committed to 
being a responsible corporate citizen—conducting 
business ethically and giving back to 
the communities that it serves. The company 
has partnered with a number of organizations 
and established giving programs that can deliver 
both tangible and intangible benefits to 
the communities served by Save Mart Supermarkets’ 
stores. Some of the partners include 
American Heart Association, City of Hope, 
Children’s Hospitals: Madera, Oakland, San 
Francisco, and Sacramento and local food 
banks. 

One event that the company has made its 
own is the Toyota/Save Mart 350. Ranked as 
one of the top ten annual NASCAR races by 
Maxim magazine, the Toyota/Save Mart 350 is 
a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series event held 
every year in June at Sonoma Raceway. Save 
Mart Supermarkets has sponsored this race 
since 1989, when it attracted only 20,000 
spectators. The annual event now draws a 
crowd of approximately 110,000 and raises 
money for the company’s charities and Save 
Mart CARES. 

Mr. Speaker, please join me in praising 
Save Mart Supermarkets for their significant 
contributions to agriculture and to the people 
of our local community.

RECOGNIZING DR. LARRY 
SCHMITZER 

HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, today I 
would like to proudly acknowledge the many 
accomplishments of Dr. Larry Schmitzer and 
his legacy of kindness and commitment to the 
well-being of others. Prior to serving individuals 
and families in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, 
Dr. Schmitzer served our country as a 
flight surgeon in Vietnam. 


E1538 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks November 12, 2014 

Dr. Schmitzer started his medical practice 
along with Dr. Mark Radbill. As their practice 
grew, they saw the need to expand in order to 
better serve our community. Along with other 
individuals, Drs. Schmitzer and Radbill helped 
establish the Delaware Valley Medical Center. 
Eventually, the organization joined Aria and is 
now known as Aria Health-Bucks County. 

Although an esteemed medical practitioner, 
the hallmark of Dr. Schmitzer’s career was his 
effort to form the Warminster Chapter of 
Gilda’s Club. Dr. Schmitzer was among the 12 
original founders and deemed the driving 
force. Named after comedian Gilda Radner 
who died from ovarian cancer in 1989, the organization 
provides emotional and social support 
for people living with cancer and the families 
that love them. They have been particularly 
attentive to the needs of children impacted 
by family members battling this horrible 
disease. 

On behalf of the constituents of Pennsylvania’s 
8th Congressional District, I offer Dr. 
Schmitzer my gratitude for a career marked 
with selfless dedication and compassion for 
our friends, neighbors and loved ones. Thank 
you, Dr. Schmitzer.

GAETANO ARMANDO FORMICA 

HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Gaetano Armando Formica who 
selflessly served as a U.S. Army soldier during 
World War II and is celebrating his 100th birthday. 
His family and friends will join together 
this Sunday to celebrate and wish him continued 
health, happiness, and prosperity. 

Gaetano Armando Formica, also known as 
Al, was born September 4, 1914. Al worked in 
the family bakery and then went on to work for 
Federal Leather. With his experience there, Al 
eventually went on to open his own shop 
where he recovered chairs and furniture. 

Al married his wife Anna in 1943. Soon 
thereafter, he was drafted into the Army and 
served in several European countries during 
World War II. His services in World War II deserve 
special recognition. 

Al was on Utah Beach, the westernmost 
part of the Allied landing beach on D-Day, the 
Invasion of Normandy. He also fought in the 
Battle of the Bulge toward the end of World 
War II. 

Al helped to liberate the Buchenwald Concentration 
Camp. It was one of the first and 
largest concentration camps on German soil 
where over 55,000 innocent souls lost their 
lives. Today, the remains of Buchenwald serve 
as a memorial and permanent exhibition and 
museum. 

Al returned to civilian life after being injured 
during the war. For many years, he served as 
commander in the Disabled American Veterans 
Post 38. He was also the Grand Marshall 
in the Memorial Parade in 2009. 

Al and his wife Anna have been blessed 
with three children, Armand, Gary, and Roberta 
as well as six grandchildren and eight 
great-grandchildren. Sadly, his son Gary was 
killed in 1970 while serving his nation in the 
Vietnam War. Truly the Formica family has 
given of itself in service of our great nation. 

Al and Anna currently reside in Bloomfield, 
NJ. Al keeps busy with gardening work, playing 
the guitar, and cooking. He also takes care 
of Anna who is wheelchair bound. 

As his friend, I am very pleased to have the 
great fortune of being able to honor such a 
marvelous member of our community. I sincerely 
wish Mr. Gaetano Armando Formica 
and his entire family the best. 

The job of a United States Congressman involves 
much that is rewarding, yet nothing 
compares to recognizing and commemorating 
the services of individuals like Mr. Gaetano 
Armando Formica. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, 
Mr. Formica’s family, friends, and all 
those whose lives he has touched, and me, in 
recognizing Gaetano Armando Formica for 
one hundred years of life dedicated to family 
and nation.

HONORING FRANCHESTER 
COLEMAN EASON 

HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 

OF MISSISSIPPI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor a self-motivated leader 
and innovator of the community, Mrs. 
Franchester Coleman Eason, who is the 
owner of Franchester’s Salon. 

Franchester was born January 3, 1969 to 
the late Eddie and Henrietta Coleman. She 
along with her 13 siblings was raised south of 
Rolling Fork, MS in a small rural community 
called Edgermount. Franchester is a graduate 
of Rolling Fork High School and holds an AA 
degree from Hinds Community College in the 
field of Cosmetology. She has worked as a 
cosmetologist since earning a license from the 
MS State Board of Cosmetology in 1990. 

Franchester began her career working for 
the late Minnie Pearl Brown at the Rolling 
Fork Beauty Charm. After working at Rolling 
Fork Beauty Charm for several years 
Franchester decided to work for Lee’s Hair 
Care, for the late Mrs. Letha Lee. Upon the 
passing of Mrs. Lee, Franchester managed 
the shop as her own for many years. In 2009 
she and her husband, Frank, were blessed 
with the opportunity to buy the business. The 
beauty shop is now called Franchester’s Salon 
and is located at 153 North 2nd Street; opens 
at 9:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m., Tuesday thru Friday. 
Franchester’s Salon offers a wide variety 
of hair care techniques. 

Franchester is a member of the National 
Beautician Association. She is also a member 
of Mt. Ollie M. B. Church in Edgermount. 

Franchester and her husband, Frank, are 
the proud parents of Catina, Mariesha, Jeremy 
and Frank III. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing Mrs. Franchester Coleman 
Eason for giving back to the community in 
which she was born and reared. 

HONORING VINCE CALLAHAN 

HON. FRANK R. WOLF 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Virginia Delegate Vincent F. Callahan, 
Jr., who passed away on September 20th, 
2014, at the Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington, 
Virginia. 

Vince represented Virginia’s 34th District in 
the Virginia General Assembly for nearly four 
decades. During his tenure on the Appropriations 
Committee, he worked tirelessly on important 
regional projects for his constituents in 
McLean and Arlington. He was always willing 
to work across the aisle to find compromise 
and get things done. 

Vince’s many legislative accomplishments 
include supporting the growth of George 
Mason University and the Dulles Corridor, as 
well as securing state funds for public spaces, 
like Wolf Trap. The northern Virginia we know 
today would not exist if it were not for Vince 
and his outstanding statesmanship in the Virginia 
General Assembly. The region owes him 
a debt of gratitude for his faithful and effective 
service. 

Vince was a man of strong convictions and 
the highest moral character. He was a true 
Virginia gentleman, family man and a loyal 
friend; he will be sorely missed by his family, 
friends and community. Vince is survived by 
his wife Yvonne, eight children, 22 grandchildren 
and two great-grandchildren. 

I respectfully submit Vince’s obituary from 
The Fairfax Times and ask my colleagues to 
join me in honoring Vince’s life and achievements. 


[From FairfaxTimes.com, Sept. 26, 2014] 
CALLAHAN’S LEGACY BURNS BRIGHT 
Fairfax County lost one of its true states-
men—and untold amounts of institutional 
knowledge—when longtime state legislator 
Vince Callahan died last Saturday from complications 
related to West Nile virus. 
Callahan, who represented McLean in the 
Virginia House of Delegates from 1967 to 
2008, will best be remembered as someone 
who cared deeply about Northern Virginia 
and spent more than half his life fighting for 
his district, his constituents and for Virginia. 
It’s hard to travel through Fairfax County 
today and not see Callahan’s fingerprints on 
many key institutions and roadways. He was 
critical in drumming up dollars and support 
for George Mason University and Northern 
Virginia Community College; many Fairfax 
residents could locate either school on a 
map. He championed Wolf Trap National 
Park for the Performing Arts when many 
others viewed the project as a waste of 
money and land. He was instrumental in establishing 
Georgetown Pike as a scenic 
byway, fending off intense pressure to four-
lane the road through Great Falls and parts 
of McLean. 
He also played a lead role in establishing 
the Dulles Toll Road, erecting sound walls 
along Interstate 495 and sparking commercial 
development on the Dulles corridor. 
Callahan’s list of accomplishments goes on 
and on, fueled mostly by a calm, inclusive 
leadership style rarely seen in today’s General 
Assembly. 
In an era of partisan bickering and political 
gamesmanship, Callahan built his career 
on putting people ahead of party and solving 
old problems rather than creating new ones. 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1539 

He was keenly aware that he worked at the 
behest of those in the 34th House district— 
not the other way around. A lifelong Republican, 
he went to Richmond each winter focused 
on improving the lives of his constituents 
in McLean, Arlington and other parts of 
Virginia. That often meant crossing the aisle 
and working with Democrats to pass critical 
legislation. It also meant standing up to lawmakers 
in his own party when they were 
pushing policy harmful to his district. 

In the midst of yet another expensive, attack-
oriented election cycle, Vince Callahan’s 
passing should serve as a reminder 
that there’s always going to be a place for 
people with firm spines, positive ideas and 
good intentions.

RECOGNIZING THE COLLINSWORTH 
FAMILY AS THE 2014 WALTON 
COUNTY, FLORIDA, FARM FAMILY 
OF THE YEAR 

HON. JEFF MILLER 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to recognize the Collinsworth family of 
Westville, Florida, for being selected as the 
2014 Walton County Farm Family of the Year. 

The Collinsworth family traces its Northwest 
Florida roots to 1894, where their ancestors 
settled near the small community of Gaskin, 
Florida. Today, about 25 miles southeast of 
Gaskin, the Collinsworth family farm, owned 
by Bobby and Hazel Collinsworth, comprises 
three generations of farmers, including their 
son-in-law and grandchildren of the Currid 
family, each of whom play an integral role in 
the family’s farming operations. 

Since 1924, Bobby and Hazel Collinsworth 
have worked tirelessly to cultivate their farm to 
the successful operation it is today. What 
originally produced corn, soybeans, cotton, 
peanuts and consisted of hogs and cattle has 
flourished into 320 acres owned and 240 
acres leased to raise 129 crossbred cows and 
16 registered Simmental cows. 

Mr. Speaker, our great Nation was built by 
farmers and their families. The Walton County 
Farm Family of the Year Award is a true reflection 
of the Collinsworth’s family dedication 
to family and farming and their shared passion 
for ranching and caring for the land for future 
generations to come. On behalf of the United 
States Congress, I would like to offer my congratulations 
to the Collinsworth family for 
being outstanding in their field. My wife Vicki 
and I extend our best wishes for their continued 
success.

CONGRATULATING CALVIN L. 
JOHNSON, SR. 

HON. LOU BARLETTA 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate 
Calvin L. Johnson, Sr. as he completes his 
time as the Worthy Grand Joshua, of the Most 
Ancient Grand Court, Heroines of Jericho, 
Inc., Prince Hall PHA of Pennsylvania. 

The Prince Hall Freemasonry is a collection 
of predominately African American jurisdictions 

in North America with a rich history dating 
back to before the Revolutionary War. In the 
1700s, upon receiving rejection by over a 
dozen colonial Freemasonries, a freed slave 
by the name of Prince Hall, along with fourteen 
other freed slaves, created a chapter 
through the Grand Lodge of England, the 
original source of Freemasonry. The position 
of Worthy Grand Joshua is one of the highest 
honors within the Prince Hall Freemasonry. 
During the past two years, Mr. Johnson’s duties 
have involved a demanding schedule of 
visits to many lodges throughout the commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania and participation in 
countless ceremonies and events. 

A lifelong resident of Pennsylvania, Mr. 
Johnson was born in Harrisburg and spent his 
formative years in Steelton. He graduated 
from Steelton-Highspire High. After completing 
high school, Mr. Johnson entered the U.S. 
Army and was able to retire as a Chief Warrant 
Officer 3, as a Criminal Investigator for 
the Department of the Army. 

His career after the military includes working 
for the Department of Environmental Resources, 
the Office of the Attorney, and the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. Most 
recently, after four years as a Security Investigator, 
Mr. Johnson left to pursue part-time 
work as a private investigator, constable, and 
tax preparer. It is during this time that he became 
the Worthy Grand Joshua, of the Most 
Ancient Grand Court, Heroines of Jericho, 
Inc., PHA. He has served in this capacity for 
two years, performing his duties professionally 
and never without a smile. 

Outside of his current role as Worthy Grand 
Joshua, Mr. Johnson also serves on the Executive 
Board of Steelton Youth in Action 
(S.Y.I.A.) as the Financial Secretary. Even 
with his many commitments, he finds time in 
his schedule to drive a school bus for 
Steelton-Highspire, McDevitt, and Central 
Dauphin students. 

George Washington, a notable Mason, once 
shared: ‘‘To enlarge the sphere of social happiness 
is worthy of the benevolent design of a 
Masonic institution; and it is most fervently to 
be wished, that the conduct of every member 
of the fraternity, as well as those publications, 
that discover the principles which actuate 
them, may tend to convince mankind that the 
grand object of Masonry is to promote the 
happiness of the human race.’’ 

Mr. Speaker, upon the completion of his duties 
as Worthy Grand Joshua, I thank Mr. 
Johnson for all that he has done for our area 
and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

HONORING DR. DEBRA STAKES 

HON. JULIA BROWNLEY 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise in recognition of Dr. Debra Stakes, 
President of the Cuesta College Federation of 
Teachers, AFT 4909. Throughout her career, 
Dr. Stakes has been a committed individual to 
the advancement of high-quality education and 
scientific research. She has been a champion 
in moving forward these principles all while 
being a staunch advocate for faculty concerns 
and promoting community engagement, organizing, 
and political activism. 

Dr. Stakes prestigious career in the 
sciences is a product of her academic tenacity 
and achievements. She is a graduate of Rice 
University and received her doctorate in 
Oceanography from Oregon State University. 
Dr. Stakes’ prominent postgraduate work included 
research appointments at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and the California 
Institute of Technology, as well as a 
year at the National Science Foundation. 
Among her many accomplishments, Dr. 
Stakes was the first woman to participate in a 
range of groundbreaking discoveries such as 
the seafloor hot vents. 

Later, Dr. Stakes taught at the University of 
South Carolina for almost eight years, where 
she was the only woman on a faculty of twenty-
five in the Department of Geology. During 
her time at the University of South Carolina, 
Dr. Stakes promoted the management of large 
educational programs to support students to 
excel and succeed in the fields of mathematics 
and science. 

Dr. Stakes continued her work and research 
in scientific and oceanic developments during 
the decade she worked as the only female scientist 
at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research 
Institute. 

In 2006, Dr. Stakes began teaching at 
Cuesta College in the fields of Geology and 
Oceanography, where she became involved in 
the faculty union as a Division Representative 
and later as the Committee on Political Education 
(COPE) Chair. Shortly thereafter, Dr. 
Stakes became the Vice President and took 
on the role of the organization’s Chief Negotiator. 


Dr. Stakes’ passion for the sciences is evident 
throughout the trajectory of her career. 
She has been a trailblazer for women in her 
field and has continuously shown outstanding 
dedication towards the value of people’s work 
and has stood against the injustice to deny 
anyone acknowledgement of their contributions. 


As the current Chief Negotiator for Cuesta 
College’s faculty union, Dr. Stakes continues 
to strive for the progress and enhancement of 
our education system, as well as the lives of 
educators. Dr. Stakes has encouraged and 
cultivated a strong bond of partnership between 
Cuesta College and the Tri-Counties 
Central Labor Council, which has benefitted 
many people throughout San Luis Obispo, 
Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties. 

For these reasons, I am pleased to join the 
Tri-Counties Central Labor Council in honoring 
Dr. Debra Stakes for her unwavering dedication 
and tireless efforts to expand the role of 
women in the workforce, the education sector 
and our community.

HONORING PETER ANDREAS 
SZEGO 

HON. ZOE LOFGREN 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise with my 
colleagues, Congress members ANNA ESHOO 
and MIKE HONDA, to recognize the impact of 
Mr. Peter Andreas Szego’s lifelong involvement 
in the life of our community. We would 
like to express our deep sadness over his 
passing on September 28, 2014, in San Jose 
at the age of 89. 


E1540 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks November 12, 2014 

To escape Hitler’s Germany, Mr. Szego immigrated 
to the United States with his family in 
1934. After he started his studies at Stanford 
University, his education was interrupted in 
1944 when he entered the U.S. Army to serve 
in Europe as a dental technician until 1946. 
After WWII, Mr. Szego returned to the United 
States to finish college, undertake course work 
toward a Ph.D., and teach at Rice University, 
Houston, Texas, and Santa Clara University. 

Around this time, Mr. Szego began his life-
long activism for civil rights, justice, peace, 
and many political campaigns for candidates 
who stood for these causes. After doing research 
for over a decade and while continuing 
to work and publish in applied mathematics, 
Mr. Szego left engineering to join the staff to 
Mr. Dan McCorquodale, the Santa Clara 
County Supervisor at the time. Among other 
things, in 1963, Mr. Szego joined an interracial 
group to take part in the March on Washington. 
Additionally, Mr. Szego served as an 
advisor to U.S. Representative Phil Burton on 
the issue of drafting fair political districts long 
before computer programs were used to draw 
boundaries. 

After his retirement from the Legislature in 
1991, Mr. Szego continued to work even harder 
to improve the lives of people of all races, 
backgrounds and ages, both on the local and 
national levels. In fact, in recognition of his numerous 
years of dedicated volunteer service, 
Mr. Szego received the AARP’s highest state 
honor, the California Percy Andrus Award for 
Community Service. Deservedly, in May, 
2014, Mr. Szego received the Santa Clara 
County Democratic Party Don Edwards Lifetime 
Achievement Award. 

We join Mr. Szego’s family, colleagues, and 
our community to express our heartfelt sense 
of loss. Mr. Szego’s service leaves our world 
a better place, and he will be dearly missed.

TO COMMEMORATE THE LIFE OF 

SARDAR GANGA SINGH DHILLON 

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate 
the distinguished life of Sardar 
Ganga Singh Dhillon, who passed away on 
September 24, 2014 at the age of 86. 

Ganga Singh Dhillon was born in the 
Sheikhupura area of West Punjab. He received 
his early education at Chak 19 and the 
Guru Nanak Khalsa High School Nanakana 
Sahib. He later joined the Sikh National College 
Lahore. 

This was a time of great political and religious 
turmoil throughout the Indian sub-continent. 
The region was on the verge of being 
divided, and the interests of the Sikh community 
were not being addressed. S. Dhillon became 
one of the foremost original leaders of 
the Sikh struggle. In 1947 he was arrested in 
Lahore along with several other students for 
promoting Khalistan, a Sikh nation. That same 
year, his father was shot and killed by the 
Pakistani army while trying to resolve an issue 
between the Sikhs and Muslims. 

Ganga Singh Dhillon then moved with his 
family to India where he was mentored by S. 
Joginder Singh Mann, an old family friend. 
While in India, S. Dhillon began his battle to 

preserve Sikh holy sites, especially the birthplace 
of the first Sikh guru, Guru Nanak Dev, 
and to allow Sikh pilgrims the right to visit 
these sites. However, his cause was considered 
far too radical, and he was taken into 
custody and held in the Nabha jail for a year 
and a half. It would take fifty years for this battle 
to be won; in 1999 the President of Pakistan 
finally granted the Pakistan Gurdwara 
Parbandhak Committee the right to maintain 
Sikh shrines and began granting more visas 
so that Sikhs abroad can visit them. 

With the help of S. Mann, Sardar Ganga 
Singh Dhillon moved to the United States in 
the 1960s where he continued his advocacy 
on behalf of Sikh concerns. S. Dhillon was 
committed to improving relationships and understanding 
between Sikhs and other cultures 
and religions. He discussed issues with patience, 
logic, and advocacy for peaceful solutions, 
even with his most bitter adversaries. In 
1965, S. Dhillon founded the John F. Kennedy 
Memorial Hockey Tournament. The core mission 
of this tournament was to build friendship 
and stronger bonds through sport, and to develop 
better understanding and mutual respect 
for people of all countries, rich and poor, 
through competition and sportsmanship. This 
tournament is now one of the largest international 
hockey tournaments in the United 
States. 

In 1981, S. Dhillon returned to India to deliver 
a Presidential Address entitled ‘‘Sikhs Are 
a Nation’’ at the 54th All India Sikh Educational 
Conference. Reaction to his speech 
was overwhelmingly hostile, forcing him to 
leave India immediately. He was banned from 
ever travelling to India as a result. 

S. Dhillon was also a leader on other issues 
of importance to the international Sikh community. 
He along with others established the 
Nanakana Sahib Foundation, the purpose of 
which was to bridge the gap between Sikhs 
and their Pakistani Muslim brothers. This foundation 
is jointly funded and run by Muslim and 
Sikh private individuals, and houses a library, 
a guest house, and hospital where free medical 
care is provided to the poor. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join 
me in commemorating and celebrating the life 
of my friend, Sardar Ganga Singh Dhillon and 
in expressing sincere condolences to his family. 
Sadar Ganga Singh Dhillon rightfully belongs 
in a select group of very rare individuals 
who, through peaceful means, have truly 
changed the world. His efforts on behalf of the 
international Sikh community and in improvement 
of relationships between cultures will 
leave a lasting legacy.

RAINN’S 20TH ANNIVERSARY 

HON. TED POE 

OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it’s my 
honor to recognize the 20th anniversary of the 
Rape Abuse & Incest National Network 
(RAINN), one of our Nation’s most effective 
victims’ organizations. 

Founded by Scott Berkowitz in 1994, RAINN 
is the Nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization. 


Their cutting edge work has changed the 
outcome for victims of sexual violence for 
years. 

They have made the country more aware of 
the evil of sexual assault and have aided millions 
of victims. 

RAINN created and operates the National 
Sexual Assault Hotline, which provides victims 
of sexual assault with free, confidential services 
around the clock and has served over 1.5 
million people since 1994. 

The hotline expanded its services going on-
line in 2007 helping to reach even more victims. 


In addition, RAINN operates the DOD Safe 
Helpline to aid victims of sexual violence in 
our military. 

Beyond the hotline and other direct victim 
services, RAINN advocates for policies that 
change the lives of victims of sexual assault 
and engages the public to advocate on behalf 
of victims’ rights bills. 

They were vital in the passage of the 
Debbie Smith Act, its subsequent reauthorizations, 
the DNA Fingerprint Act, and the Kate 
Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Protection Act, 
and the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting 
Act. 

I worked with RAINN on SAFER for years 
along with Congresswoman MALONEY and 
Senator CORNYN. 

SAFER provides grants to states and localities 
with existing funds to audit their rape kit 
backlog and makes this information available 
to the public. 

SAFER also mandates that more current 
funds go directly to test rape kits. 

Despite the various barriers we encountered 
throughout the years since this idea was 
brought to me by RAINN, Scott Berkowitz and 
the incredible staff at RAINN never gave up. 

They persevered because they knew it was 
right. 

They knew that SAFER would bring justice 
to victims and put perpetrators where they belong, 
behind bars. 

Scott’s spirit is like that of a Texan, even 
though he’s from New Jersey, but we won’t 
hold that against him. 

That is why we work together so well. 

Congratulations on 20 years of making a 
true difference in victims’ lives.

THE HURLBURT AIR FORCE ASSOCIATION 
CHAPTER 398 HIGH 
SCHOOL TEACHER OF THE YEAR 
FOR 2014 

HON. JEFF MILLER 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
privilege to recognize Ms. Susan Cundiff as 
the Hurlburt Air Force Association (AFA) 
Chapter 398 High School Teacher of the Year 
for 2014. Ms. Cundiff was among three educators 
selected throughout Northwest Florida 
for her inspiring efforts to bolster her students’ 
interest in science, technology, engineering 
and math (STEM) education, and I am 
pleased to honor her outstanding achievements. 


Ms. Cundiff joins the ranks of teachers previously 
bestowed this honor for her more than 
three decades of service as an educator at 
Gulf Breeze High School and her service to 
the Gulf Coast community. Since 1983, she 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1541 

has witnessed and has played an integral role 
in the growth of some of the finest minds of 
our Nation’s youth. Through her passion for 
teaching, which has helped spark her students’ 
sense of wonder and interest in the 
world around them, Ms. Cundiff’s contributions 
to producing the next generation of active participants 
in our society, and perhaps future scientists 
and engineers, cannot be overstated. 

Her tireless efforts and innovative techniques 
have brought unique hands-on learning 
opportunities into the classroom. As a result of 
this practical learning, her students gain a 
working knowledge of wireless computer integration 
and electronics construction. Today, 
her students can also be found researching, 
building, wiring, programming and testing robots 
on a specified task. 

Her dedication to the community, however, 
is not confined within the classroom. Ms. 
Cundiff is active in Hurlburt AFA Chapter’s 
aerospace educational programs, devoting her 
time and energy to assist in planning and organizing 
events. She also utilizes her considerable 
experience and success in the classroom 
to assist in the professional development 
of other educators throughout the area at the 
Chapter’s Teacher Workshops, sharing best 
practices and stimulating lessons that can be 
brought back to their respective classrooms. 

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate 
Ms. Cundiff on this well-earned achievement 
of Hurlburt Air Force Association Chapter 398 
High School Teacher of the Year for 2014 and 
thank her for her commitment to service and 
dedication to the Northwest Florida community. 
My wife Vicki joins me in wishing Ms. 
Cundiff all the best for continued success.

HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 

OF MASSACHUSETTS

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to David L. McKeehan, the 
President and Chief Executive Officer of the 
North Central Massachusetts Chamber of 
Commerce (NCMCC). After 30 years of dedicated 
service, Dave will be retiring from the 
Chamber of Commerce on December 31,

Dave formed the North Central Massachusetts 
Chamber of Commerce by merging the 
Fitchburg and Leominster Chambers of Commerce, 
along with smaller business groups. 
Over the course of his tenure, he procured 
over $4.5 million in private sector funding and 
over $1 million in government grants for economic 
development programming in the region. 
Under his leadership, the Chamber of 
Commerce has grown a community of business 
memberships reaching over 1,000 member 
firms that employ upward of 25,000 individuals 
in the cities of Leominster and Fitchburg 
and surrounding towns. Dave was instrumental 
in the creation as well as saving of 
jobs within North Central Massachusetts during 
his years at the Chamber. 

Dave is a true leader within the community 
and Chambers across the country. His hard 
work and dedication was recognized when he 
was awarded the ‘‘Service Above Self Award’’ 
by Mount Wachusett Community College for 
his contribution to the school as well as the 29 
surrounding cities. Dave was also recognized 
by Fitchburg State University as being one of 
the ‘‘100 Most Influential People in the Last 
100 Years.’’ When David officially retires, the 
Chamber of Commerce will lose a remarkable 
president and asset to their organization. 

I ask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating 
David McKeehan on his retirement 
and wishing him the very best with his future 
endeavors.

CHAPTER 398 MIDDLE 
SCHOOL TEACHER OF THE YEAR 
FOR 2014 

HON. JEFF MILLER 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
privilege to recognize Ms. Penny Moore as the 
Hurlburt Air Force Association Chapter 398 
Middle School Teacher of the Year for 2014. 
Ms. Moore was among three educators selected 
throughout Northwest Florida for her inspiring 
efforts to bolster her students’ interest 
in science, technology, engineering and math 
(STEM) education, and I am pleased to honor 
her outstanding achievements. 

The never-ending yearning to help others is 
the foundation on which Ms. Moore has built 
her success as an educator. Prior to moving 
to Northwest Florida, Ms. Moore worked as a 
special needs teacher inspiring students at 
Churchill Academy in Montgomery, Alabama. 
She has since spent the last decade of her 
professional career teaching at Avalon Middle 
School in Milton, Florida. Her willingness and 
constant ability to adapt to the ever-changing 
needs of her students is a challenge that Ms. 
Moore embraces and is furthermore evidence 
of her passion to mold and enlighten the 
minds of our Nation’s youth. 

While she holds high expectations for her 
students and works diligently with them to 
master theory and practice, she also inspires 
and motivates her students to rise to the occasion 
and put theory into practice. Under her 
leadership and guidance as the school’s 
science, technology, engineering, activity and 
math (STEAM) team, nearly 100 students from 
all grade levels have competed in boosting engineering, 
science, and technology (BEST) robotics 
competitions and the Science Olympiad 
and have represented Northwest Florida at 
state and national competitions. Furthermore, 
Ms. Moore recognizes the importance for her 
students to experience science and technology 
outside of the classroom and affords 
them the unique opportunity to visit the Flight 
Adventure Deck and the National Naval Aviation 
Museum aboard Naval Air Station Pensacola, 
where students complete preparatory 
lessons and apply their knowledge of what 
they have learned through hands-on activities 
at the Adventure Deck. 

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate 
Ms. Moore on this well-earned achievement of 
Hurlburt Air Force Association Chapter 398 
Middle School Teacher of the Year for 2014 
and thank her for her commitment to service 
and dedication to the Northwest Florida community. 
My wife Vicki joins me in wishing Ms. 
Moore all the best for continued success.

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize the City of Camarillo 
as it celebrates 50 years as a thriving and 
prosperous community in the heart of Ventura 
County, California. I would like to acknowledge 
and congratulate the City of Camarillo, along 
with its residents, on this historic milestone. 

The City of Camarillo was incorporated on 
October 22, 1964, and was named after 
Adolfo and Juan Camarillo, the proprietors of 
Rancho Calleguas. At the time of the city’s incorporation, 
a population of approximately

of the municipality. Today, Camarillo boasts 
an appealing mixture of rural and suburban 
lifestyles to its over 66,000 residents covering 
a region that spans an estimated 19.5 square 
miles. 

Located in the Pleasant Valley at the eastern 
end of the Oxnard Plain, Camarillo has 

developed into a flourishing community since 
its incorporation. The city has become known 
for its outstanding high-tech retail stores, specialty 
businesses, and modern buildings. Additionally, 
Camarillo has been ranked as one of 
the safest communities in Ventura County, an 
ideal and premiere city to raise a family, live, 
and work. 

Furthermore, the City of Camarillo is home 
to an exceptional educated workforce, with a 
premiere four-year public university. California 
State University Channel Islands (CSUCI) was 
established in 2002 and has been a phenomenal 
addition to the fabric of the city and 
surrounding community. 

Throughout the years, Camarillo has maintained 
a balance between modernity and history. 
While providing modern amenities to its 
residents, the city is peppered with significant 
cultural and historic landmarks, such as the 
Camarillo Ranch House, the Pleasant Valley 
Historical Museum, and Saint Mary Magdalen 
Catholic Church. 

Since 1964, the City of Camarillo has defined 
itself as a distinguished community, with 
a wealth of history, culture, and innovation. 
Camarillo takes pride in its unparalleled quality 
of life and the many attributes of the community 
that have lasted throughout the years. For 
these reasons, it is my sincere pleasure to 
congratulate the City of Camarillo on their 50th 
Anniversary.

CONGRESSWOMAN HONORS MS. 
LAURA LAWTON-FORSYTH, RECIPIENT 
OF THE 2014 NAOMI BERBER 
MEMORIAL AWARD 

HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 

OF WASHINGTON 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Ms. Laura Lawton-
Forsyth of Spokane, Washington for receiving 
the Printing Industries of America’s 2014 
Naomi Berber Memorial Award. I am pleased 
to recognize her contributions as a business 
leader who works diligently to support Eastern 
Washington’s economy as well as providing 
employment opportunities for citizens in Eastern 
Washington. 

Founded in 1940 by Frank A. and Frank H. 
Lawton, Laura’s grandfather and great-grandfather, 
Lawton Printing Inc. has remained a 
family business for more than seven decades. 
Through the years, Lawton Printing Inc. has 
been dedicated to serving the needs of its clients, 
enabling them to grow and diversify their 
business offerings. 

Joining the company in 1991, Ms. Lawton-
Forsyth held a variety of positions before 
being named president in October of 2001— 
the fourth generation of her family to hold that 
position. In 2012, Laura served as Chair of the 
Board of the Printing Industries of America, 
overseeing the direction and activities of the 
world’s largest graphic arts trade association, 
representing an industry of more than 900,000 
employees. As such, she became the second 
woman to be elected to the position since its 
founding in 1887. Leadership on a national 
level runs in the Lawton family. Her father, 
Ray, was also Chair of the Printing Industries 
of America, making the Lawtons the only father-
daughter pair to serve in that role. 

In presenting the 2014 Naomi Berber Memorial 
Award to Ms. Lawton-Forsyth, the Printing 
Industries of America honors this outstanding 
woman in the graphic communications 
industry for her exceptional record of accomplishments, 
contributions to the development 
of the graphic communications industry

dedication and hard work. I also want to congratulate 
her, as leader of Lawton Printing Inc. 
and File-Ez Folder Inc., for receiving the 2014 
Naomi Berber Memorial Award. I applaud her 
dedication to the printing industry and her contributions 
to the success of the economy in 
Eastern Washington.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today

School. 

Julia Bancroft Elementary School, located in 
Auburn, Massachusetts, was recently named a

where students are valued and differences 
are celebrated. The Julia Bancroft 
pledge, ‘‘I believe, I will achieve, and I will 
succeed,’’ encompasses Julia Bancroft Elementary 
School’s tenets to help each student 
reach their potential. 
To encourage students to become leaders 
and give back to their community, Julia Bancroft 
Elementary promotes numerous Community 
Service Learning Projects. Through fundraising, 
volunteer work, and reading programs, 
these projects have instilled in the students 
the importance of ‘‘giving back.’’ Other programs 
that contribute to student development 
while simultaneously benefiting the community 
include the Inventors’ Fair, Turkey Trot, 

C.A.R.E. program, Literacy Night, Math Night, 
annual Community Reading Day, the Festival 
of the Arts, and various food drives. 
Additionally, Julia Bancroft Elementary has 
strived to close academic gaps between students. 
Through the implementation of planned 
Intervention Blocks, Professional Learning 
Community discussions, and consistent differentiated 
instruction, teachers have targeted 
high-achievers and developed specific targeted 
instruction. This has resulted in the closing 
of gaps in the low income and special 
needs subgroups. 

None of this would be possible without the 
talented educators and staff members of Julia

CHAPTER 398 ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOL AND OVERALL 
TEACHER OF THE YEAR 
FOR 2014 

HON. JEFF MILLER 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
privilege to recognize Ms. Sarah Mason as the 
Hurlburt Air Force Association Chapter 398 Elementary 
School and the esteemed Overall 
Teacher of the Year for 2014. Ms. Mason was 
among three educators selected throughout 
Northwest Florida for her inspiring efforts to 
bolster her students’ interest in science, technology, 
engineering and math (STEM) education, 
and I am pleased to honor her outstanding 
achievements. 

Though Ms. Mason has been teaching for 
ten years, she was keenly aware of her passion 
for putting others before herself long before 
she stepped foot in a classroom as an 
educator. Her teaching aspirations took flight 
in high school, when she joined the Gold Seal 
Quality Care program her junior year, which 
afforded her the opportunity to inspire the 
young minds of local elementary school students. 
Ms. Mason built on this positive experience 
and pursued a Bachelor of Education at 
the University of West Florida. She has spent 
the last seven years of her decade of teaching 
at Blue Angels Elementary School in Pensacola, 
Florida. 

Ms. Mason credits her family for igniting in 
her curiosity and passion for science, which 
indirectly led to the chemical reaction rocket 
experiments in her backyard as a child that 
have helped her cultivate tomorrow’s scientists 
and engineers as an adult. She brings science 
to life in her classroom through hands-on activities, 
like the pegboard ‘‘engineering wall’’ 
that allows students to engineer their own creations 
using pegs, rubber bands, and pipes 
and the building and analyzing of marble roller 
coasters to understand mathematical, scientific 
and engineering concepts through real world 
applications. 

Ms. Mason also welcomes the latest technology 
in her classroom, including iPads loaded 
with STEM applications that stimulate student 
interest in outer space through the engineering 
of models of irregular galaxies and 
discovering the complex motions of the planets 
of our solar system, as well as constructing 
motors. In addition, Northwest Florida 
is home to some of the world’s finest engi


neers, and Ms. Mason has partnered with Gulf 
Power Company making it possible for her 
students to engage its engineers in the developing 
of their classroom robots. 

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate 
Ms. Mason on this well-earned achievement of 
Hurlburt Air Force Association Chapter 398 Elementary 
School and the esteemed Overall 
Teacher of the Year for 2014 and thank her 
for her commitment to service and dedication 
to the Northwest Florida community. My wife 
Vicki joins me in wishing Ms. Mason all the 
best for continued success.

HONORING NATIVE HERITAGE 
MONTH AND SACRIFICES MADE 
BY NATIVE AMERICAN VETERANS 


HON. TAMMY DUCKWORTH 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
recognition of Trickster Art Gallery for its presentation 
of Native American Veteran artwork in 
honor of Native Heritage Month and Veterans 
Day. 

During the month of November, we celebrate 
the ancestry and time-honored traditions 
of Native Americans, as their contributions 
have been and continue to be instrumental in 
the development of our great Nation. Native 
Americans have helped shape American conservation 
policy, enriched American culture 
and have fought gallantly for our country. 

From the Revolutionary War to current combat 
missions, American Indians have played a 
vital role in the United States Military. In World 
War II, for example, over 375 Navajo Marines 
were trained as Code Talkers and famously 
saved countless lives with their unbreakable 
codes. 

Native Americans continue to serve honorably 
on behalf of our Nation. According to the 
Department of Defense, American Indians and 
Alaska Natives have a greater proportion of 
Veterans than the general United States population. 
As a Veteran myself, I understand the 
great sacrifice and courage of the Native 
American Veteran community. 

I am proud to represent the Eighth Congressional 
District where the diverse cultures of 
our great Nation are celebrated.

COMMENDING THE NORTHERN VIRGINIA 
REGIONAL PARK AUTHORITY 
ON ITS NEW JEAN R. PACKARD 
CENTER 

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate 
the Northern Virginia Regional Park 
Authority on the ground breaking for the new 
Jean R. Packard Occoquan Center. Work on 
this multi-purpose facility will kick-off of a 
major rejuvenation effort throughout Occoquan 
Regional Park, which sits in Fairfax County 
just across the Occoquan River from the Town 
of Occoquan in Prince William County. 

The 400 acre park is popular with families, 
boaters, and fisherman with its easy access to 

the river, athletic fields, picnic areas, and connections 
to multiple regional trails, including 
the Gerald E. Connolly Cross County Trail and 
the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail. 
The modernization of this regional park will 
feature a new entrance with greater roadside 
visibility, a loop trail traversing the entire park, 
a landscaped waterfront plaza, and other infrastructure 
improvements. 

A new focal point of the park will be the 
Jean R. Packard Center, named in honor of 
my good friend and mentor. Jean recently retired 
from the Regional Park Board after 24 
years of dedicated service. It is difficult to 
overstate the tremendous environmental legacy 
Jean has cultivated here in Northern Virginia. 
A veteran of the Women’s Army Corps 
during World War II, Jean moved to Fairfax in 
1951 and got her start in public service much 
the same way I did as president of her neighborhood 
civic association. Thus began five 
decades of civic engagement, particularly focused 
on environmental stewardship and protection. 


She was the first woman elected as chairman 
the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors 
in 1972 and was an unabashed environmentalist 
before it became trendy. During my 
14 years on the County Board starting in 
1995, Jean was a member of my trusted kitchen 
cabinet and helped shape our award-winning 
environmental agenda. After her tenure 
on the Board of Supervisors, Jean became the 
first woman elected to the Northern Virginia 
Soil and Water Conservation District Board of 
Directors. Though not continuous, she has 
served on the Board multiple times over the 
past 40 years, and she is in the midst of her 
most recent term at the age of 91! 

She was a founding member of the Northern 
Virginia Conservation Trust, which recently 
renamed its lifetime achievement award in 
Jean’s honor, and she has served on the national 
board of the Sierra Club. She has been 
recognized as Fairfax County’s Citizen of the 
Year and Fairfax County Conservationist of 
the Year. I was proud to present Jean with the 
Fairfax County Park Authority’s Sally Ormsby 
Environmental Stewardship Award, which is 
named in memory of our dear friend and fellow 
community leader. 

Fittingly, the new center that will bear Jean’s 
name will include a robust educational component 
on our local history and the environment. 
It will tie in with the nearby Suffragist memorial 
within the park, and it will feature an interpretive 
collection showcasing the native flora and 
fauna of Northern Virginia at the time of John 
Smith’s historic expedition in 1608. From its 
perch overlooking the river, the Jean R. Packard 
Center will put on full display the beauty 
of our local parks and demonstrate the value 
of protecting environmental treasures like the 
Occoquan for future generations. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in commending the Northern Virginia Regional 
Park Authority for undertaking this grand park 
renewal and for its stewardship of its many 
other properties throughout the region, and I 
ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating 
the immeasurable contributions of Jean Packard 
a true environmental champion, who has 
dedicated her life to protecting and improving 
the natural resources that make our community 
such a wonderful place to live, work, and 
play.

OF MARYLAND 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate 
and recognize Jim Xinis and his twenty-five 
years at the helm of Calvert Memorial Hospital. 
Jim has been a tireless fighter to ensure 
the best service for the people of Calvert 
County and throughout southern Maryland. 

Jim is an honest, confident, creative, and inspiring 
leader. He’s been an effective manager 
and a visionary. His twenty-five years leading 
Calvert Memorial Hospital have been a period 
of growth and change that have increased 
quality, efficiency, and innovation for the benefit 
of patients and their families. 

I will never forget how, in the summer of 
2009, when the nation was engaged in a heated 
debate over passage of the Affordable 
Care Act, I asked Jim to facilitate a town hall 
meeting at North Point High School so I could 
hear from residents of the Fifth Congressional 
District on this important issue. It was quite a 
meeting with over 1,500 in attendance—and 
Jim displayed such grace and tact in keeping 
the meeting focused over several hours on the 
issues at hand and making sure everyone had 
a chance to weigh in. It was no easy task. 

But Jim has never been one for easy tasks. 
Recognizing the challenge of rising health 
care costs and affordability, Jim created Calvert 
Healthcare Solutions, which serves the 
uninsured throughout the county. And under 
his leadership, Calvert Memorial Hospital has 
been the lowest cost hospital in Maryland for 
twenty consecutive years, with a reputation for 
providing a full range of services at a very 
high quality of care. At the same time, he has 
worked to preserve its warm community spirit, 
where patients can feel comfortable, cared for, 
and empowered. Jim’s good humor and positive 
attitude have surely contributed to his effective 
leadership and his reputation for excellence. 


I wish him well in retirement and thank him 
for his extraordinary service to Calvert County, 
to Maryland, and to our nation.

are using social media platforms to inspire 
others to become active members of their 
communities by performing their own acts of 
kindness.

RECOGNIZING THE DEDICATION 
AND HONORABLE SERVICE OF 
COLONEL JUSTIN McCARTHY 
‘‘MAC’’ MILLER, USMC (RET.) 

HON. JEFF MILLER 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to recognize a member of the Greatest Generation, 
Colonel Justin McCarthy ‘‘Mac’’ Miller, 
United States Marine Corps Retired, upon the 
occasion of his 100th birthday. Colonel Miller 
has dedicated his life to service to his community, 
his family, and to our great Nation, and 
I am humbled to honor him and his remarkable 
achievements today. 

Born in 1914, aviation has always been a 
stronghold in Colonel Miller’s life. As a young 
man, he admired the pursuit pilots, or fighter 
pilots, of the Allied Forces. From his early encounters 
with comic books and magazine covers 
depicting the Lafayette Escadrille, to his 
application to the United States Naval Academy, 
Colonel Miller knew his life’s destiny was 
to become a fighter pilot. 

While at the Naval Academy, he resigned 
as a midshipmen and enlisted in the United 
States Marine Corps as an aviation cadet in 
1940 before receiving his wings in 1941. His 
first assignment was as an Instructor Pilot in 
Pensacola, Florida, where he would return 
later in life. He then was assigned to Staff and 
Command school at United States Marine 
Corps Base, Quantico. Though these two assignments 
were perhaps not the most ideal for 
someone just pinning on wings eager to enter 
theater, shortly after the beginning of World 
War II, not only would Colonel Miller be presented 
with the opportunity to fly in combat, 
but he would be assigned as the Commanding 
Officer and take on the role of Executive Officer 
of the newly-established fighter squadron 
VMF 217, training in the F4F Wildcat. In 1943, 
the squadron embarked on the USS BARNES 
(CVE–20) deployed to the South Pacific, 
transitioned aircraft to the F4U Corsair, and 
flew combat missions over the Solomon Islands. 
In 1944, the squad embarked on the 
USS SANTEE (CVE–29) and deployed to 
Guam, where they commenced strikes against 
the island of Rota. In October 1944, Colonel 
Miller took Command of VMF–321 until 1945, 
when the squadron returned to the United 
States. Throughout his tour in the Pacific Theater, 
Colonel Miller commanded two fighter 
squadrons. He then joined the Reserves in 
1948 after the end of the war, where he continued 
his career in flight while also proving to 
be a successful businessman, as evidenced 
by his ownership of many radio stations, including 
WCOA Pensacola. 

Amongst his vast array of accolades and 
contributions lay a century’s worth of anecdotes, 
including being taught to fly his favorite 
aircraft, the F4U Corsair, by the legendary 
Charles Lindbergh himself. Amazingly, 

Stars, amidst an interminable list of decorations, 
honors, and awards for his distinguished 
service in World War II. 

Mr. Speaker, Colonel Justin McCarthy 
‘‘Mac’’ Miller is a valued member of our community 
and national history. He is a true 
‘‘American Patriot’’ and an inspiration to all 
who have had the privilege of being a part of 
his exemplary life. My wife Vicki and I wish 
him a happy birthday as he turns 100 years 
young, and we wish him and his entire family 
all the best in their future endeavors.

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of a fallen American hero, United States 
Navy SEAL Lieutenant Michael Murphy with a 
tribute to his most heroic life. On October 22, 
2007 The Medal of Honor was presented to

RECOGNIZING THE LEADERSHIP 
OF MR. SONNY HASHMI IN ADVANCING 
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY 
INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE 
CITIZEN SERVICES, SAVE 
TAXPAYER DOLLARS, AND PROMOTE 
BEST PRACTICES ACROSS 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize 
and congratulate my constituent, Mr. 

Sonny Hashmi of Oakton, Virginia for being 
selected as a 2014 Samuel J. Heyman Service 
to America Medal finalist in the management 
excellence category. 

The nonprofit, nonpartisan Partnership for 
Public Service presents the Samuel J. 
Heyman Service to America Medals annually 
to pay tribute to America’s dedicated civil servants. 
These prestigious medals honor and celebrate 
an esteemed group of Federal employees 
that have achieved significant accomplishments 
in the course of serving their country. 
Honorees are public servants who represent a 
broad and diverse array of disciplines and career 
fields. All nominees exemplify the ideal 
Federal employee with respect to their strong 
commitment to mission, and the creativity and 
spirit of innovation each brings to his or her 
respective agency. 

Mr. Hashmi serves as the Chief Information 
Officer for the United States General Services 
Administration, or GSA. In this role, Mr. 
Hashmi is responsible for managing GSA’s 
$600 million information technology budget 
and ensuring that GSA’s IT initiatives effectively 
align with the agency’s strategic goals 
and government-wide leadership responsibilities 
in key areas, such as information security 
and enterprise architecture efforts. 

According to the Partnership for Public 
Service, Mr. Hashmi was instrumental in 
launching GSA’s groundbreaking ‘‘Drive to the 
Cloud’’ initiative. This program enabled GSA 
to lead by example in becoming the first agency 
to transition its email services to a cloud-
based platform, along with its collaboration 
and documents management tools. It is projected 
that these two migrations from legacy 
systems to cloud-based platforms will result in 
$15 million in savings for the agency by 2016. 

Under Mr. Hashmi’s visionary leadership, 
GSA has also worked to ensure its lesson 
learned and best practices permeate across 
the Federal Government, and it is a testament 
to Mr. Hashmi’s success that each year, additional 
agencies follow GSA’s blueprint and 
guidance in moving to embrace shared services 
and innovative cloud-based solutions. 

Mr. Hashmi represents precisely the type of 
Federal Chief Information Officer our government 
desperately needs more of. I fully concur 
with GSA Administrator Daniel Tangherlini’s 
recent observation that, ‘‘Sonny not only fixes 
problems, but also provides newer and better 
solutions. He is a leader in the best sense. He 
is all about the outcome and builds a team 
that shares that desire.’’ 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in extending our highest praise and congratulations 
to Mr. Sonny Hashmi for being selected 
as a finalist for the 2014 Samuel J. 
Heyman Service to America Management Excellence 
Medal. Mr. Hashmi and his fellow 
nominees all boast impressive accomplishments, 
from working to eradicate polio in India 
to landing an exploratory vehicle on Mars to 
saving the Air Force more than $1 billion in 
2012 by reducing energy consumption. It has 
been my great privilege and honor to represent 
Mr. Hashmi and the tens of thousands 
of exceptional Federal workers who hail from 
Virginia’s 11th Congressional District. Each 
one deserves our gratitude and respect. 

CELEBRATING 120 YEARS OF 
SERVICE BY THE SISTERS OF 
MERCY 

HON. HENRY CUELLAR 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate a momentous occasion—the 120 
years of service the Sisters of Mercy have 
graciously provided the City of Laredo, Texas. 
For over a century, these Sisters have faithfully 
contributed to the health and well-being of 
the residents within my hometown. 

Three Sisters arrived in Laredo in 1894 with 
the mission of building the city’s first hospital. 
They came from Dublin, Ireland, and less than 
one month after their arrival, they accomplished 
their goal and opened a medical facility 
with six rooms and twelve beds. Though 
they were not formally trained in nursing, they 
committed to learning in order to serve the 
needy of Laredo. As the population and health 
care needs grew, Sisters of Mercy expanded 
to new buildings to care for as many 
Laredoans as possible. 

Over the last 120 years, nearly 120 Sisters 
have faithfully served in Laredo, many of 
whom served for decades at a time. There are 
presently five sisters who serve the Laredo 
community: Sister Maria Luisa Vera, who recently 
celebrated her 50th jubilee and is President 
of Mercy Ministries; Sister Rosemary 
Welsh, who has served Laredo for 22 years 
and is the Executive Director at Casa de 
Misericordia and the Director of Outreach 
Services at Mercy Clinic; Sister Olivia 
Obregon, who has served for a total of 33 
years in various nursing supervisory positions; 
Sister Kathleen Tinnel, who has served Laredo 
for 12 years both as a pediatric nurse 
and a minister; and the newest Sister—Sister 
Beth Yoest—who is on the faculty at St. Peter 
Memorial School. 

Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have the opportunity 
to recognize the Sisters of Mercy for 
commendably caring for the citizens of Laredo 
throughout the past 120 years.

REGIONAL PLANNING COUNCIL 


HON. JEFF MILLER

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
privilege to commemorate the 50th Anniversary 
of the West Florida Regional Planning 
Council and recognize its significant impact 
and contributions to Northwest Florida. 

The West Florida Regional Planning Council 
was established in 1964 as the Pensacola-
Escambia County Regional Council when the 
need of transportation planning and coordination 
was recognized. As the third regional 
planning council to have been formed in the 
State of Florida, it has since grown to also include 
Bay, Holmes, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, 
Walton, and Washington Counties and their 
municipalities. In addition to transportation 
planning, the Council today provides a forum 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1547 

to engage its members in regional planning, 
comprehensive economic development strategic 
planning, emergency preparedness planning, 
environmental planning and education, 
and intergovernmental review. Furthermore, 
the Council provides assistance in grant-writing, 
project management, technical planning, 
and data analysis. 

Due to its collaborative nature, the Council 
naturally recognizes the importance of an all-
of-community and region approach. To that 
end, it welcomes and encourages citizens 
throughout the Gulf Coast to become engaged 
in the process to actively address and solve 
problems of the growing region. 

Over the past five decades, the Council has 
dedicated their efforts to preserving and enhancing 
the quality of life in Northwest Florida. 
Their contributions have helped ensure that 
the Emerald Coast remains a top tourist destination 
and a place where thousands live like 
millions wish they could. 

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States 
Congress, it gives me great pleasure to commemorate 
the 50th anniversary of the West 
Florida Regional Planning Council. My wife 
Vicki joins me in thanking all of its members 
for their devotion to service and wishing them 
and the Council all the best for continued success.

IN RECOGNITION OF DONALD 

FRAZIER MACIVER, JR., CHAM


PION OF LGBT VETERANS 

HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is a great 
privilege to recognize Donald Frazier MacIver, 
Jr., who has dedicated his life to serving his 
country, his community, and his fellow military 
service members and veterans. Donald’s service 
began as a Senior Medical Specialist Non-
Commissioned Officer in the U.S. Army’s elite 
5th Special Forces Group. In Vietnam, Donald 
showed the depth of his commitment to service 
by participating in extraordinarily hazardous 
missions behind enemy lines as a 
member of the covert Military Assistance 
Command Vietnam Studies and Observations 
Group (MACV–SOG). His military decorations 
include the Bronze Star Medal. 

In the last fifty years, Donald has worked 
tirelessly to advance the dignity and equal 
treatment of GLB service members and veterans. 
In 1993, Donald was arrested at the 
White House for his nonviolent civil disobedience 
in protest of the implementation of the 

U.S. military’s discriminatory ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t 
Tell’’ policy. Donald has also served as a volunteer 
consultant on proper treatment and dignity 
for those living with HIV and AIDS. His 
contributions to the HIV/AIDS community include 
time as the Chair of the Community Advisory 
Board of the New York University Medical 
School, NYU Langone Medical Center, 
and Bellevue Hospital Center HIV/Hepatitis/Infectious 
Diseases Research Networks, and 
volunteer consultancy to the U.S. Department 
of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Public 
Health/Clinical Public Health. In 2011, Donald 
was awarded a Certificate of Appreciation 
from the VA Office of Public Health/Clinical 
Public Health for his ‘‘dedicated service and 
commitment to improving the care provided to 
our nation’s veterans.’’ 

As president of the Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual 
(GLB) Veterans of Greater New York, 
Donald’s leadership inspired GLB veterans 
who were discharged from the military for ‘‘homosexual 
conduct’’ to demand the respect and 
honor due for their faithful service. When unforeseen 
circumstances forced the closing of 
the GLB Veterans’ office in January 2014, 
Donald went once again to action. Concerned 
that decades of activism and records of the 
discriminatory treatment of GLB veterans 
would be lost to history, Donald selflessly volunteered 
hours of his expertise to a coalition 
dedicated to preserving the GLB Veterans’ archives. 
In March 2014, Donald singlehandedly 
organized, securely packaged, and transported 
sixteen boxes of archived records to a 
secure storage site in Bronx, New York. His 
continued stewardship of the records protects 
the memory of military veterans who faithfully 
served our country in World War II, Korea, 
Vietnam, and elsewhere. It is impossible to 
calculate the value of Donald’s contributions to 
GLB veterans’ recognition and equality in New 
York City and the United States of America.

RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS 
AND CAREER ACHIEVEMENTS 
OF DR. SCOTT GERALD 
BORG, WHOSE LEADERSHIP HAS 
BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN DEVELOPING 
AMERICA’S ANTARCTIC 
RESEARCH PROGRAM INTO ONE 
OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AND 
ACCOMPLISHED IN THE WORLD 

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize 
and congratulate my constituent, Dr. 
Scott Gerald Borg of Fairfax Virginia, for being 
selected as a 2014 Samuel J. Heyman Service 
to America Medal finalist in the career 
achievement category. 

The nonprofit, nonpartisan Partnership for 
Public Service presents the Samuel J. 
Heyman Service to America Medals annually 
to pay tribute to America’s dedicated civil servants. 
These prestigious medals honor and celebrate 
an esteemed group of Federal employees 
that have achieved significant accomplishments 
in the course of serving their country. 
Honorees are public servants who represent a 
broad and diverse array of disciplines and career 
fields. All nominees exemplify the ideal 
Federal employee with respect to their strong 
commitment to mission, and the creativity and 
spirit of innovation each brings to his or her 
respective agency. 

Dr. Borg serves as the Head of the Section 
for Antarctic Sciences within the National 
Science Foundation’s Division of Polar Programs. 
According to the Partnership for Public 
Service, under Dr. Borg’s direction, the National 
Science Foundation’s Antarctic research 
program has become one of the most esteemed 
and comprehensive on the continent. 
Today, Dr. Borg plays a critical role in guiding 
the U.S. Antarctic science program that supports 
cutting-edge research across a range of 
topics, including climate change, the origins 
and nature of the universe, and the discovery 
of new species of extinct dinosaurs. 

The work being facilitated by Dr. Borg and 
his colleagues is truly groundbreaking research. 
For example, Dr. Borg’s leadership is 
credited with overcoming numerous technical 
and logistical challenges that enabled the National 
Science Foundation to complete the 
West Antarctic Ice Sheet drilling project, which 
extracted ice core that dates back 68,000 
years and represents the highest-resolution 
record of climate obtained to date. Further, Dr. 
Borg also oversaw the development of clean 
drilling technology that retrieved the first-ever 
pure water samples from an Antarctic lake a 
half mile below the surface of ice sheet. These 
samples are estimated to have been sealed 
under the ice for approximately 15 million 
years, and may enable researchers to understand 
what types of life can survive on other 
worlds. 

Being named a finalist by the Partnership 
for Public Service is just the latest honor in Dr. 
Borg’s outstanding and celebrated career that 
has made tremendous contributions to the 
global research community and elevated the 
prestige of Federal scientific research over the 
past two decades. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in extending our highest praise and congratulations 
to Dr. Scott Gerald Borg for being selected 
as a finalist for the 2014 Samuel J. 
Heyman Service to America Career Achievement 
Medal. Dr. Borg and his fellow nominees 
all boast impressive accomplishments, from 
working to eradicate polio in India to landing 
an exploratory vehicle on Mars to saving the 
Air Force more than $1 billion in 2012 by reducing 
energy consumption. It has been my 
great privilege and honor to represent Dr. 
Borg and the tens of thousands of exceptional 
Federal workers who hail from Virginia’s 11th 
Congressional District. They all deserve our 
thanks and respect.

RECOGNIZING THE DEDICATION 
AND HONORABLE SERVICE OF 
CAPTAIN ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ RASMUSSEN, 
USN (RET.) 

HON. JEFF MILLER 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to recognize retired Navy Captain Robert 
‘‘Bob’’ Rasmussen for his lifetime of honorable 
service and dedication to our great Nation on 
the occasion of his retirement as Director of 
the National Naval Aviation Museum aboard 
Naval Air Station Pensacola. 

A native of Sacramento, California, Bob was 
born on May 26, 1930, and entered the Navy 
through the Naval Aviation Cadet Program in 
1951. He excelled in flight training school at 
NAS Whiting Field and NAS Pensacola, both 
located in Northwest Florida, and was assigned 
to a fighter squadron in San Diego, 
California, where he deployed on multiple occasions 
to the Western Pacific aboard the carrier 
USS Philippine Sea. In 1956, he was selected 
to join the elite Navy Flight Demonstration 
Team, the Blue Angels. For three years, 
he awed and inspired millions of Americans 
flying flight demonstrations as the right wing 
pilot and number four slot. Bob continued his 
tours at sea in Fighter Squadron 33 aboard 
the USS Intrepid and as a Flag Lieutenant to 


E1548 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks November 12, 2014 

Deputy Commander Atlantic Fleet before completing 
the Navy Postgraduate School program 
in Monterey, California. In 1966, he was assigned 
to Fighter Squadron 111 aboard the 
USS Oriskany, where he completed two combat 
tours in Vietnam and served as first Executive 
Officer and then Commanding Officer. 
Before returning to combat in Vietnam as the 
prospective Air Wing SIXTEEN Commander, 
subsequently selected for Captain and assigned 
as Chief of Staff and Operations Officer 
of Carrier Division SEVEN and then as 
Commanding Officer of the ammunition ship 
USS Mount Hood, Bob completed a tour in 
our Nation’s capital region. 

After the end of the war, he served as Commanding 
Officer of Roosevelt Roads Naval 
Station in Puerto Rico before later returning to 
Washington to command the Aviation Officer 
Distribution Division of the Bureau of Naval 
Personnel. Following three decades of service 
as one of the finest Naval aviators in history, 
recording 650 carrier traps and with more than 
5,000 flight hours logged, as many 
servicemembers do, Bob found his way back 
to Pensacola where he completed his Naval 
service in 1983 as the Commanding Officer of 
the Naval Aviation Schools Command. 
Throughout his prestigious career, he received 
many awards, including three Legions of Merit, 
the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the 
Bronze Star. 

Bob’s love for aviation, however, remained, 
and his artistic prowess proved too strong, as 
he went on to serve as the Naval Aviation Museum 
Foundation Director of Development for 
four years before becoming Director of the National 
Naval Aviation Museum in 1987. During 
his tenure there, he produced hundreds of 
naval aviation watercolor pieces and several 
bronze sculpture works for the Museum, the 
Foundation, and several other historic venues, 
earning him the R.G. Smith Award for excellence 
in naval aviation art. As a direct result 
of his efforts, the Naval Aviation Museum 
more than tripled in size and remains the most 
successful Naval museum in the country as 
close to one million people visit and enjoy the 
museum each year. 

My wife Vicki and I join Northwest Florida— 
and a grateful Nation—in thanking Captain 
Bob Rasmussen for his more than six decades 
of admirable military and public service 
and wish him all the best as he takes off in his 
retirement alongside his wife, Phyllis; their 
children, Kathryn and Eric; and grandchildren, 
Christopher, Ashton, Emily Page, Madison, 
Avery, and Jack.

IN RECOGNITION OF ST. 
BERNADETTE SCHOOL 

HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 

OF MASSACHUSETTS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of 
Representatives to join me in recognizing the 
wonderful accomplishments of the St. Bernadette 
School. 

St. Bernadette School, located in 
Northborough, Massachusetts, was recently 
named a 2014 National Blue Ribbon School 
by the U.S. Department of Education. Deeply 
rooted in Catholic ideals, St. Bernadette 

School strives to encourage intellectual curiosity, 
spiritual inspiration, and a high moral 
compass. Its rigorous academic program, 
commitment to Catholic values, and diverse 
student body has led the School to be called 
the ‘Flagship of the Diocese’ by the Most Reverend 
Robert J. McManus, Bishop of Worcester. 


Since its founding in 1997, St. Bernadette 
School’s enrollment has grown exponentially. 
The School’s current body of approximately 
500 students enables it to give students individual 
attention while holding them to high 
academic standards. 

Through new initiatives, St. Bernadette 
School has incorporated technology into the 
learning process. Recently, the School has 
built a computer lab, a mobile Macintosh lab, 
and installed interactive whiteboards in every 
class room. An iPad program was also started 
in the 2012–2013 academic year, providing 
every student with additional learning opportunities. 
Foreign language programs are required 
at every grade level, in addition to pre-
algebra and project-based learning initiatives. 
This diverse curriculum has resulted in many 
middle school students at St. Bernadette being 
selected to the Junior Honor Society, an organization 
that recognizes achievement in Scholarship, 
Leadership, Service, Character and 
citizenship. 

St. Bernadette also fosters community 
through its extra-curricular programs, hosting a 
variety of family-oriented events and fund-
raisers throughout the year. The Parent Guild 
hosts events such as Spree Day, Family Picnic, 
Walkathon, and more. The parents of St. 
Bernadette students also coach the school’s 
sports teams, which include basketball, cross 
country, golf, ski, and track. In addition, students 
from grades 6–8 are divided into 
Houses, where they practice leadership and 
responsibility while planning communal outreach 
programs. 

None of this would be possible without the 
work of the talented educators and staff members 
of St. Bernadette School. Principal Deborah 
C. O’Neil has demonstrated a passionate 
commitment to the success of her students. 
Time and time again, this has been exemplified 
through the School’s consistent growth 
rate and track record of achievements. 

I’m so proud to represent the faculty, students, 
and staff of St. Bernadette School, and 
I cannot wait to hear about their future successes. 
I ask you to join me in congratulating 
St. Bernadette School for being selected as a 
2014 National Blue Ribbon School.

RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS 
OF MS. ALICE LIPPERT IN 
DEVELOPING A CRITICAL INFORMATION-
SHARING SYSTEM TO 
COORDINATE THE EMERGENCY 
RESPONSE SERVICES OF THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND 
POWER COMPANIES FOLLOWING 
NATURAL DISASTERS 

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize 
and congratulate my constituent, Ms. 
Alice Lippert of Fairfax, Virginia, on being se


lected as a 2014 Samuel J. Heyman Service 
to America Medal finalist in the homeland security 
and law enforcement category. 

The nonprofit, nonpartisan Partnership for 
Public Service presents the Samuel J. 
Heyman Service to America Medals annually 
to pay tribute to America’s dedicated civil servants. 
These prestigious medals honor and celebrate 
an esteemed group of Federal employees 
that have achieved significant accomplishments 
in the course of serving their country. 
Honorees are public servants who represent a 
broad and diverse array of disciplines and career 
fields. All nominees exemplify the ideal 
Federal employee with respect to their strong 
commitment to mission, and the creativity and 
spirit of innovation each brings to his or her 
respective agency. 

Ms. Lippert is one of three United States 
Department of Energy officials who are being 
recognized for their significant contributions to 
the development of the groundbreaking data 
visual platform, known as EAGLE–I. EAGLE– 
I is our Nation’s first-ever system that can 
gather and share real-time emergency situation 
information on power and natural gas infrastructure. 
As one disaster program manager 
at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers noted, 
before EAGLE–I, ‘‘It was difficult to get a clear 
picture of what was going on. Now we rely on 
the DOE as the authoritative source.’’ 

According to the Partnership for Public 
Service, Ms. Lippert, a senior technical advisor 
in the Department of Energy’s Office of Electricity 
Delivery and Energy Reliability, was instrumental 
in recognizing that our country’s inability 
to collect and access real-time data on 
energy infrastructure during an emergency 
represented a critical vulnerability that hampered 
the Federal Government’s ability to effectively 
coordinate the response to major natural 
disasters, such as the destructive Hurricanes 
Katrina and Rita. 

Ms. Lippert was not satisfied with the status 
quo emergency response system, which was 
antiquated and cumbersome in requiring Department 
personnel to directly contact energy 
companies to obtain data that would have to 
be manually entered into a data base. This 
process could take hours and did not provide 
Federal, State, and local first-responders with 
the real-time data they needed to gain situational 
awareness of a locality’s battered power 
and natural gas infrastructure. 

Ms. Lippert took the initiative by contacting 
two colleagues with subject matter expertise in 
advanced grid modeling and computer programming. 
Together, these civil servants 
worked in-house to build EAGLE–I, which now 
covers 75 percent of all U.S. electricity customers. 
However, it was not until October 
2012 that EAGLE–I was put to the test, and 
the true value of Ms. Lippert’s leadership and 
hard work was realized. 

In the aftermath of the damaging Hurricane 
Sandy, our Nation’s first-responders and 
emergency managers had access to regular 
updates on the grid status in the hard hit 
areas, enabling decisions to be guided by accurate 
and up-to-date data and information. As 
the Department’s Assistant Secretary for Electricity 
Delivery and Energy Reliability noted, 
‘‘These reports were critical to decisions by 
federal, state and local officials in responding 
to and recovering from the catastrophe. The 
power outage reports gave insight to senior 
DOE leadership and responders that allowed 
them to make informed decisions, reducing 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1549 

both the human and economic impacts associated 
with the storm.’’ 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in extending our highest praise and congratulations 
to Ms. Alice Lippert on being selected 
as a finalist for the 2014 Samuel J. Heyman 
Service to America Homeland Security and 
Law Enforcement Medal. It has been my great 
privilege and honor to represent Ms. Lippert 
and the tens of thousands of exceptional Federal 
workers who hail from Virginia’s 11th 
Congressional District. They all deserve our 
deep gratitude and respect.

MARKING THE PASSING OF JAMES 
BRADY 

HON. NANCY PELOSI 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor 
the memory of James Scott Brady, a courageous 
champion in the fight against gun violence 
and the legacy of lifesaving leadership 
he leaves behind. Through triumph and tragedy, 
Jim Brady remained an insistent and impassioned 
voice of clarity and consequence in 
our national effort to strengthen our gun laws. 
His death at age 73 concludes a life defined 
by public service and personal bravery—and 
renews the call to action that he made so well 
for so long. 

Jim Brady, a proud alumnus of the flagship 
institution in his home state, the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, discovered a 
life-long passion for public policy after earning 
a Bachelor of Science degree in political 
science. 

After graduating, Brady worked with some of 
the leading American political figures of the 
late 20th century. As an aide to then-State 
Senator Everett Dirksen—who would later 
serve in the U.S. House of Representatives 
and as the U.S. Senate Minority Leader— 
Brady deepened an abiding belief in the power 
of public service to build a better world. 

As an advisor to top-level public officials at 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
Office of Management and Budget, 
Department of Defense and the U.S. Senate, 
Brady became an indispensable counselor 
and trusted friend to many. He was tapped to 
serve as Director of Public Affairs and Research 
for the Reagan-Bush Committee and, 
following the election, as Spokesperson for the 
Office of the President-Elect and White House 
Press Secretary. 

On a fateful March in 1981, Jim Brady suffered 
a gunshot wound to the head during the 
assassination attempt on President Reagan’s 
life. The road to recovery would be hard, but 
Jim and his wife, Sarah Brady, would inspire 
the nation with their resolve. 

Strengthened by their own struggle, Jim and 
Sarah vowed to take a stand on behalf of all 
victims of gun violence. This couple’s heroic 
leadership challenged our nation to act, and 
because they did, millions of Americans are 
safer and many of our communities are more 
secure. 

It took the Bradys six years, seven votes, 
three administrations, endless strength and 
boundless courage to enact the Brady Handgun 
Violence Protection Act. But, thanks to 
their dedication, the Brady bill became the law 
of the land. 

By 2010, the Brady law had blocked felons 
trying to buy guns more than a million times— 
an average of 171 felons denied applications 
to buy firearms a day. Almost 300,000 domestic 
violence offenders were prevented from 
buying guns. Thanks to Jim and Sarah Brady, 
countless families have been spared the tragedy 
of gun violence. 

In recognition of this leadership, Jim Brady 
was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom 
by President Bill Clinton. Today, the 
White House press secretary addresses the 
media—and the nation—from the James S. 
Brady Press Briefing Room. 

Every day, the Bradys’ legacy is felt in lives 
saved by the law that bears his name. Jim 
Brady’s perseverance challenges all of us to 
never stop fighting for the common sense gun 
violence reduction measures our nation needs. 
Jim Brady was a man of extraordinary wit, 
charm and courage, and he will be sorely 
missed by all who had the good fortune to 
know him 

I hope that it is a comfort to Jim’s wife, 
Sarah, his children and all of his loved ones 
that so many people across the country share 
their grief and mourn the loss of such a valiant 
and dedicated man.

IN RECOGNITION AND APPRECIATION 
OF MR. KENT HILL, DIRECTOR 
OF THE KANSAS CITY VA 
MEDICAL CENTER FOR 40 YEARS 
OF SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY 
AND CONSUMMATE DEDICATION 
TO OUR VETERANS 

HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 

OF MISSOURI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Kansas City VA Director Kent 
Hill, a transformational leader with an open 
door policy that is known for the unselfish public 
service that he has provided to our veterans, 
their families, his staff, and to me in my 
capacity as United States Representative for 
the Fifth District of Missouri. I think it is important 
to recognize the accomplishments of 
those who professionally serve with distinction. 
Director Hill has done so modestly without 
bringing attention on himself. 

The scope of his work since 2002 at the 
Kansas City VA Medical Center included an 
operating budget of approximately 
$260,000,000, approximately 1,500 employees 
and providing healthcare services to more 
than 45,000 veterans. He had the added responsibility 
of opening and overseeing clinical 
programs, including five Community Based 
Outpatient Clinics, and the new Honor Annex. 
In addition, the Kansas City VA Medical Center 
has a vibrant research and outreach program. 


When Kent Hill took over as Director for the 
Kansas City VA Medical Center, he came in 
as a veteran who had attended the Air Force 
Academy and has spent 40 years in Federal 
service. During his career, he cultivated a successful 
management style, centered on personal 
involvement and respect for his staff and 
the veterans and their families that he served. 
He was an advocate of the methodology outlined 
in the book, ‘‘The Servant Leader’’. His 
staff worked within a management style that 

delegates power, believes in a team approach, 
motivation, recognition, and at the core; an understanding 
for the veterans and their issues. 
He has been a strong advocate for continuing 
professional growth through education and initiated 
a mentoring program. 

Under Kent Hill’s direction, the hospital has 
undergone a complete floor to floor update 
and expanded to include: new surgical suites, 
Women’s Clinic, Chiropractic care, state of the 
art Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, Hospice 
Unit, Blind Rehab Center, Cochlear implant 
program, Sleep Lab, New Ambulatory 
Surgery Unit, an OIF/OEF Case Management 
Program and a new Dialysis Unit. 

Access to VA healthcare and services have 
long been a priority for Director Hill. His management 
and oversight of veteran access included 
weekly meetings with clinical leaders to 
review capacity for appointments and wait 
times as well as decisions on adding staff and 
new services. To facilitate easy access for veterans 
to the programs and services of the 
Kansas City VA Medical Center, Director Hill 
originated a Greeter program, a Vet 4 Vet 
navigator program and shuttle service to and 
from the parking lots; and a successful and 
long awaited Veterans Transportation Service 
became operational. He tackled telephone access 
and electronic messaging to providers. 
Director Hill did not stop with services and 
programs at the main hospital—but placed 
emphasis on taking VA healthcare outside the 
parent facility and into the surrounding communities. 
He activated a Mobile Medical Unit, 
opened Community Based Outpatient Clinics, 
and built a community-based Radiation Therapy 
Building. One of his more noteworthy 
achievements was the opening of a large outpatient 
building—the Honor Annex—that 
houses mental health services, primary care 
and a women’s clinic. 

One of the compliments that I have heard 
often is regarding cleanliness and modernization 
of the hospital. An example of his receptiveness 
and desire for a more accessible environment 
can best be illustrated with the Director’s 
directive to remove glass partitions 
that had created barriers between staff and 
veterans. This important move coincided with 
many communication and outreach initiatives. 

During my time in office, I have watched the 
Kansas City VA gear up for returning veterans 
from current conflicts while maintaining services 
to all of our existing veterans. An example 
of Director Hill’s proactive style became 
evident as the current conflicts brought new 
mental health problems and illnesses, he 
called for focused education for his staff on 
how to identify and help veterans coming 
home from combat. With the continual evolution 
of hidden wounds from war, he ensured 
the staff was trained to identify signs of Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder, Traumatic Brain Injury 
and possible suicide. Expanding of mental 
health services included veterans having access 
to Veterans Court as well as a multitude 
of homeless programs and initiatives. An example 
of the influence and impact of Director 
Hill’s leadership is the widespread participation 
of the KCVA staff in the spring and fall community 
Heart of America Stand Down for 
homeless veterans. Director Hill can be seen 
every year personally distributing boots to 
homeless veterans. Since arriving in Kansas 
City, Director Hill has championed inner city 
and rural outreach programs to ensure veterans 
are aware of their many benefits. His 


E1550 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks November 12, 2014 

outreach efforts have touched veterans in 
many different locations throughout the Heartland. 
In 2013, Kansas City VA staff hosted 
and/or participated in more than 40 veteran-focused 
events. Director Hill can be seen at 
many different events always supporting 
causes and programs for our veterans. He has 
a strong dedication and commitment to the 
veterans he serves. One of the most compelling 
stories about Director Hill is when he attended 
the funeral of a civil war veteran, 
whose family had long-awaited formal burial. 
These are only a few of the many examples 
of how Kent Hill has torn down barriers and 
gained the respect of our veterans. 

Perhaps the most gratifying praise one can 
receive is to have the respect and appreciation 
from those they serve. Among the veterans 
of Missouri’s Fifth District, Director Hill is 
regarded as a listener who takes their concerns 
seriously and will take the time to discuss 
solutions, explains his position with diplomacy 
and compassion. In an effort to have a 
closer relationship with our veterans, he meets 
periodically with the Veterans Focus Liaison 
Committee. This committee concept was presented 
to Director Hill by a group of veterans 
who received services at the Kansas City VA 
Medical Center. The idea was readily accepted 
and this grassroots committee took shape. 
The members talk to their peers and relay 
their concerns to the Director. He has been receptive 
to their suggestions and always willing 
to investigate their grievances. This partnership 
has resulted in more honest communication 
and better relations between staff and the 
veterans they serve. Veterans have commented 
that when meeting with Director Hill, 
he already was aware of the issue and had 
been working on solutions. 

Mr. Speaker, please join me and our colleagues 
in recognizing and honoring Mr. Kent 
Hill, Director of the Kansas City VA Medical 
Center upon his retirement from the Department 
of Veterans Affairs. While he embraces 
this next phase of life with his wife, Anita; children, 
Blake, Kirk, Keith and Stephen; and 
grandchildren, he leaves with the respect and 
admiration of those who have had the pleasure 
of working with him. I wish to personally 
thank him for his tireless service to our country 
and his unquestionable dedication to our 
veterans. His imprint will long be felt by future 
generations at the Kansas City VA Medical 
Center and in our community.

COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNI


VERSARY OF THE JAY PEANUT 

FESTIVAL 

HON. JEFF MILLER 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
privilege to commemorate the 25th Anniversary 
of the Jay Peanut Festival and recognize 
its founders, Gene and Brenda Gabbert and 
the community of Jay, Florida. 

The Town of Jay, situated in northern Santa 
Rosa County, Florida near the Florida/Alabama 
line, is home to over 500 residents and 
the annual Jay Peanut Festival. 

A quarter of a century ago, Gene and Brenda 
Gabbert founded the festival in honor of 
their daughter Melissa, who had lost her battle 

with cancer at the young age of 19. Melissa 
found great joy in frequenting agricultural festivals 
throughout the Gulf Coast and the special 
sense of community that festivals often 
bring to life. After her passing, the Gabberts 
started the Jay Peanut Festival to keep 
Melissa’s memory alive and bring together the 
entire Northwest Florida community in celebration 
of the area’s deep agricultural history. 

In the 25 years since, the festival has flourished. 
While the pig chase has remained a 
highlight, what began in 1990 as a one-day 
event with 30–40 vendors is now a two-day 
event with 230 booths, live entertainment, carnival 
rides, 5k run, and a parade. The staple 
of the festival—the peanut—may attract the 
tens of thousands of visitors from all over; 
however, to the Town of Jay, the festival is 
much more than that. It’s also a celebration of 
community, that Melissa was so fond of, and 
its members who have helped carry on this 
proud tradition. 

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to commemorate 
the 25-year history of the Jay Peanut Festival. 
My wife Vicki joins me in wishing the Gabberts 
and the Town of Jay all the best for continued 
success.

Prior to becoming County Judge, Diana 
Bautista worked for the county as a clerk, as 
a Secretary for the jail Administrator, and then 
became a Pleasanton police officer and 
Atascosa County Sheriffs Deputy. During her 
time with public service offices such as these, 
Judge Bautista learned how she could best 
serve the people of Atascosa County. Taking 
her oath in 2003, Judge Bautista has served 
admirably for over a decade, boldly advocating 
for the citizens and employees of the county. 
In addition to her exemplary career, Judge 
Bautista is a committed wife and mother and 
a cancer survivor. 

Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have the opportunity 
to recognize Judge Diana Bautista. 
Her dedication to the citizens of Atascosa 
County has truly made her community a better 
place to live and work.

Shepherd Housing Foundation. For the past 
quarter century, the Foundation has provided 
low-cost housing to the homeless and those 
on the brink of homelessness in Prince William 
County. 

Good Shepherd Housing Foundation was 
established in 1989 when the need for housing 
for the mentally ill became apparent. The 
first group home, ‘‘Shepherd House I,’’ opened 
in 1989 with a $1,500 donation from co-founders, 
Horace and Virginia Baker. As the parents 
of an adult child with mental health issues, the 
Bakers knew firsthand the challenges in finding 
safe housing options that would allow their 
son to live as independently as possible while 
receiving the care he needed. Mr. and Mrs. 
Baker, along with Good Shepherd Lutheran 
Church, worked closely with the Prince William 
County Community Services Board to establish 
the bedrock of a stable and lasting program. 
In its beginning, the Foundation provided 
housing for five single adults. 

Since its inception, Good Shepherd Housing 
Foundation has grown substantially in both clientele 
and breadth of mission. Now in 25th 
year, the Foundation provides housing and 
supportive services for 77 single adults and 45 
families in 70 households throughout Prince 
William. Assistance is extended to those with 
chronic low income and mental or physical 
disabilities. The organization is sustained by 
the efforts and donations of individuals, businesses, 
and churches, and it receives assistance 
from local, state, and federal funding. 

The Shepherd Homes Program offers group 
living and single adult housing options to men-
tally-ill individuals. Shepherd Homes I, II, and 
III are properties owned by the Foundation 
that function as group homes. The Foundation 
also provides eight apartments, one townhouse, 
and one affordable rental house maintained 
by the Foundation offering the mentally 
ill, some of whom are veterans, relief from 
chronic homelessness. Beyond housing assistance, 
the Foundation offers services that put 
residents on a path to financial and psychological 
stability. 

Over the years, the Foundation has expanded 
its mission providing a broader scope 
of resources to the community to aid in providing 
housing to individuals and families who 
are homeless or in danger of becoming homeless. 
The Foundation offers a holistic program 
approach aimed not only at providing housing 
but also teaching program participants the importance 
of education and financial management. 
Programs and services include the Affordable 
Rentals Program, Shepherd Homes, 
Shepherd Leasing, and a two-year Transitional 
Housing Partnership. Tutoring and child-care 
services are also available for the children. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join 
me in honoring the work of Good Shepherd 
Housing Foundation in Prince William and in 
congratulating it on the occasion of its 25th 
anniversary. The Foundation exists thanks to 
the dedication and generosity of its board, 
staff, volunteers, and many community supporters, 
and it is another example of what 
makes Prince William such a wonderful place 
to live.

RECOGNIZING THE DEDICATED 
SERVICE OF NORTHWEST FLORIDA’S 
DEBORAH ‘‘DEE’’ 
COPELAND 

HON. JEFF MILLER 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am 
privileged to recognize Ms. Deborah ‘‘Dee’’ 


November 12, 2014 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1551 

Copeland upon the occasion of her retirement. 
For 42 years, Ms. Copeland has dedicated her 
career to educating our Nation’s youth and 
serving the Gulf Coast community. 

A graduate of Belhaven College in Jackson, 
Mississippi, Ms. Copeland began teaching at 
Mowat Junior High School in Panama City, 
Florida, in 1972. Eight years later, she joined 
the faculty at King Middle School in Milton, 
Florida, where she has established herself as 
a leader amongst the great educators in 
Northwest Florida and where she teaches 
today, chairs the History/Civics Department, 
and is the Student Government Association 
Advisor. 

For over four decades, Ms. Copeland has 
inspired the minds of our Nation’s youth, and 
her innovative techniques have brought unique 
learning opportunities and experiences to her 
students. Whether organizing an annual visit 
to Tallahassee, the state capital, to engage 
her students in the legislative process, sponsoring 
an annual Veteran’s Day program to 
honor area veterans and first responders and 
educate her students on the contributions and 
sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, or 
building pyramids and volcanoes, Ms. 
Copeland’s passion for teaching is demonstrated 
through each of her tireless efforts 
in making learning enjoyable and bringing it to 
life. 

Her dedication and service, however, is not 
confined to her classroom at King Middle 
School. Ms. Copeland teaches hospital homebound 
students in the evenings as well as 
Sunday School at her local church. She has 
also organized and sponsored countless 
events, including the Ronald McDonald House 
Easter Basket to benefit Sacred Heart Children’s 
Hospital in Pensacola, Florida; a 
Thanksgiving food basket drive to provide for 
the needy; a blanket giveaway for our area’s 
homeless and to support low-income families; 
and Meet-the-Candidate breakfasts during 
election years to afford an additional opportunity 
to her students and the local community 
to participate in the democratic process. 

Her involvement in the classroom and 
throughout the community has not gone unnoticed. 
As a result of her commitment to excellence 
and service, Ms. Copeland has received 
myriad awards, including the Alpha Delta 
Kappa Educator of the Year in 2012, the Governor’s 
Award in Education, the International 
Award ISTE Ana Mackay-Gutierrez Award for 
Community Giving, the Santa Rosa County 
Volunteer of the Year in 2006, the Veteran’s 
State Teacher of the Year in 2007, and the 
King Middle School ‘‘Teacher of the Year’’ 
award three times throughout her tenure. 

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Ms. 
Deborah ‘‘Dee’’ Copeland for her lifetime of 
achievements and dedication to the Northwest 
Florida community. My wife Vicki joins me in 
wishing Ms. Copeland all the best for continued 
success in her well-earned retirement and 
thanking her for her service.

RECOGNIZING THE STROKE COME


BACK CENTER’S 10TH ANNIVER


SARY 

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize 
the Stroke Comeback Center on the 

occasion of its 10th anniversary and the critical 
health care services that it provides to 
stroke survivors and their families in our community. 


The SCC is a non-profit founded by Darlene 
Williamson and John Phillips in 2004 to create 
a community in which stroke survivors and 
their families could receive proper long-term 
treatment. Meaningful care for stroke survivors 
is limited in the United States, and the SCC is 
one of less than ten such facilities. The mission 
of the SCC has been to pick up where 
traditional health care coverage misguidedly 
leaves off by providing affordable speech and 
language services to stroke survivors in a supportive 
and participating environment. No patient 
is ever turned away because they can’t 
afford the cost. 

The current situation of stroke coverage and 
care is in desperate need of reform. It is common 
misconception that recovery is quick and 
easy when in reality stroke survivors require 
comprehensive rehabilitation for a protracted 
period of time to fully regenerate their cognitive 
and physical abilities. Yes insurance 
coverage for such care, if provided at all, runs 
out within 3–12 months, and the Medicare 
therapy cap for speech and physical therapy 
falls well short of covering the true costs. 
There is an estimated direct and indirect cost 
of about $73.7 billion. However, it is impossible 
to measure the emotional, physical, and 
financial burden a stroke puts on a survivor 
and their family. 

Today, the SCC operates with about 100 individuals 
served in 40 groups weekly, growing 
from just five groups in 2005. More than a 
dozen committed volunteers contribute more 
than 3,000 hours annually. The SCC works 
closely with national, state, and local stroke-
related organizations and receives referrals 
from all of the major hospital centers in the 
metropolitan area. Ninety-three percent of survivors 
report improvement in one or more 
areas of speaking, listening, writing or reading. 
On average, survivors report that they are now 
three times more confident in their social interactions 
allowing them to reestablish their role 
in their family and the community. The success 
of the SCC is due in part to their 
undiminished and comprehensive programs. 
Its life participation, group-based approach 
helps patients achieve their maximum potential. 


Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing the contributions and achievements 
of the Stroke Comeback Center and its 
dedicated staff and volunteers over the past 
10 years. The services and programs offered 
by the SCC fill a void in the rehabilitation process 
and significantly improve the quality of 
lives of stroke survivors and their families.

IRON BILL 

HON. TED POE 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on May 31, 
2013, Houston Fire Department suffered its 
most tragic event in its history. Four of Houston’s 
bravest firefighters died in the line of 
duty, fighting a 5-alarm blaze at a hotel in 
southwest Houston: 

Captain EMT Matthew Renaud, 35, of Station 
51; 

Engineer Operator EMT Robert Bebee, 41, 
of Station 51; 

Firefighter EMT Robert Garner, 29, of Station 
68; 

Probationary Firefighter Anne Sullivan, 24, 
of Station 68. 

They were the best we had in Houston, and 
we are still saddened that they are gone. 

The hotel’s hellish inferno claimed the lives 
of these four firefighters and injured fourteen 
other firefighters when the roof collapsed— 
some critically. One of the brave who survived 
was Captain William Dowling, also known as 
‘‘Iron Bill.’’ 

Iron Bill was injured serving Houston, the 
community in which he was raised. A graduate 
of Klein Oak High School, Captain Dowling left 
Texas to serve his nation as an enlistee with 
the United States Marine Corps. In 1993, on 
leave from Marine boot camp training, he married 
his high school sweetheart—Jacki. As a 
Marine, Iron Bill served 4 years, including a 
deployment to Somalia with I Marine Expeditionary 
Force in support of Operation Restore 
Hope, 1995. He returned home to Texas and 
to Jacki to begin his career and to start a family. 
Twenty-one years later, Captain Dowling 
and Jacki have three children: Forrest, Faith 
and Foster. 

Iron Bill’s patriotic spirit and love of the community 
led him to join the Houston Fire Department. 
He graduated from the Houston Fire 
Department Academy in 2000 and steadily 
rose through the ranks. He worked at Stations 
12, 19, and 48 before making Captain at Station 
68 in January of 2013. Firehouse 68 is located 
at the corner of Bissonnet and South 
Gessner in the ‘‘heart of Southwest Houston’’. 
In 2013, the fire apparatus of Firehouse 68 
made 14,847 responses, making it the third 
busiest fire station in the City of Houston. 
There, at Firehouse 68, Captain Dowling became 
known as ‘‘Iron Bill,’’ a fitting nickname 
to describe a strong and courageous hero. 

It was just five months after he arrived at 
Station 68 that Captain Dowling and fellow 
firefighters received an alarm call that would 
take them to the gates of hell. 

On that fateful day, in the heat of the Texas 
noonday sun, Captain Dowling along with the 
four other firefighters rushed into the hotel to 
find potential trapped guests. While the firefighters 
were in the hotel, the roof collapsed, 
trapping and killing Garner and Sullivan from 
Station 68 and Bebee and Renaud from Station 
51. Captain Dowling’s legs were crushed 
and burned, but he remained calm, radioed for 
help and waited for his brothers to pull him 
from the flames. 

The attending physician in the ambulance 
said that Captain Dowling, though severely injured, 
kept asking about the condition of his 
crew. He was more concerned for the safety 
of others than himself—the testament of a true 
hero. He told the doctor, on the way to the 
hospital, to tell his wife and children that he 
would fight for them. Hearing this comes as no 
surprise to Captain Dowling’s family: they 
know him as a fighter. 

Captain Dowling was seriously injured with 
burns over thirty percent of his body, and he 
was placed in a medically induced coma for 
months at Memorial Hermann Hospital and 
Medical Center. He subsequently had both 
legs amputated and suffered brain damage. A 
long road of recovery was ahead for Captain 
Dowling, but surrounded by a team of doctors, 
his family, firefighter family, friends, church 


E1552 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks November 12, 2014 

and the entire city and state of Texas, Iron Bill 
was not alone. Deservingly, Captain Dowling 
became everyone’s hero. 

Finally, six months after the fire, Captain 
Dowling left the hospital and went home, 
riding in Station 68’s newly dedicated fire 
truck. Of course, he sat in the Captain’s Chair. 
Along the drive home, he was greeted by firefighters 
and members of the community, who 
lined the streets and highways from the Texas 
Medical Center to Tomball. 

Since returning home, Jacki left her full time 
job at Frank Elementary to care for her husband 
full time. It’s no surprise that as a Texas 
woman, she’s strong and determined, but 
quite simply, the strength that she possesses 
is amazing. To keep the community updated 
on Iron Bill, she started blogging on a community 
Facebook page (entitled ‘‘Capt. William 
Dowling Iron Bill’’). This blog allows the community 
to rally behind the Dowling family: cry 
with them, laugh with them, pray for them and 
see their hero survive. 

In the last year, Captain Dowling has received 
a customized fire tank chair. It’s an 
ATV-like wheelchair, and he loves driving it! At 
home, Houston Texans’ JJ Watt visited Iron 
Bill and presented him with a Houston Texans’ 
jersey with the #68 proudly displayed. Captain 
Dowling loves to sing and play guitar—from 
Bon Jovi to Third Day—and Texas Country 
music star, Cory Morrow, played for him when 
he was in the hospital. He was even able to 
travel to San Diego to see his son Private Forrest 
Dowling follow in his footsteps and graduate 
from the Marine Corps’ Recruit Training. 
When Private Forrest Dowling held his newly 
earned Eagle, Globe and Anchor in the palm 
of his hand with pride after completing the 
Crucible, April 17, 2013, Forrest said that the 
main reason he decided to sign the dotted line 
and become a Marine, was because of his 
dad. He said my dad was a Marine and always 
wanted me to become a Marine as well, 
so it’s what I set out to do. Despite his amazing 
progress, Captain Dowling has had his 
share of challenges. His pain is debilitating— 
so much so that Jacki cried out for help and 
prayers that he could be seen by a team of 
experts who had experience with traumatic 
amputations. She had heard of the work of the 
team at Brooke’s Army Medical Center, which 
operates the only DOD Burn Center, at Fort 
Sam Houston and set out to work to get him 
admitted. The community rallied, launching a 
change.org petition, emailing and calling 
BAMC and reaching out to my office. It’s rarely 
talked about, but most Congressional offices 
spend the majority of their time on ‘‘casework,’’ 
offering constituents help with a federal 
department or agency. 

Within a matter of hours, Brooke’s Army 
Medical Center deemed Captain Dowling admissible, 
saying they are honored to receive 
him and that he would be embraced by fellow 
Marines. Once the appropriate medical 
records were transferred, an ambulance transported 
Iron Bill from St. Luke’s Hospital to 
Brooke’s Army Medical Center for further 
treatment. 

As Iron Bill gets the medical care that he 
needs, I hope he knows the community of 
Tomball and the greater Houston area and, of 
course, Texas’ Second District eagerly awaits 
his return home. When that happens, I hope 
we line the streets and cheer for him once 

again. For our community will always be grateful 
for his service and sacrifices. Once a hero, 
always a hero. 

And that’s just the way it is.

HONORING THE LIFE AND DEDICATED 
SERVICE OF NORTHWEST 
FLORIDA’S BELOVED GEORGE H. 
WHITEHURST 

HON. JEFF MILLER 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to recognize the life and dedicated service of 
Northwest Florida’s beloved George H. Whitehurst 
who passed away on October 19, 2014. 
Throughout his long and distinguished career 
as a mayor and businessman, Mr. Whitehurst 
served as a mentor and an inspiration to 
countless individuals. All those who have been 
blessed by his presence and leadership mourn 
the loss of a great man and esteemed public 
servant. 

Mayor Whitehurst was born in Greenwood, 
Florida on July 28, 1926 to George and Ethel 
Whitehurst. Upon graduating from Greenwood 
High School, he enrolled in Florida State University 
where he was a part of the Flying High 
Circus and performed on the flying trapeze. 
From 1943 to 1945, Mayor Whitehurst honorably 
served our Nation in the United States 
Navy as a hospital corpsman, as well as an 
operating room technician. Following his military 
service, he continued his education and 
graduated from the Indiana College of Mortuary 
Science in 1950. In 1955, Mayor Whitehurst 
settled in Crestview, Florida, where he 
and his wife, Annelle, opened the Whitehurst 
Funeral Home. In 1961, he entered the public 
service arena where he would use his great 
business sense to lead the Crestview community 
as mayor for more than two decades. 

As Crestview’s longest serving mayor, 
Mayor Whitehurst tirelessly worked to better 
the city he loved. He successfully advocated 
for increased public safety and economic development, 
which resulted in the establishment 
of two police substations and the Crestview 
Public Safety Building, development of an 
emergency transportation corridor, restoration 
of a cemetery, construction of the Okaloosa 
County Veterans Memorial, conversion of the 
former Yellow River Railroad bed into Industrial 
Drive, and a revitalized downtown, among 
other efforts. 

Mayor Whitehurst was a man of conviction 
and was widely respected by those who knew 
him. The community’s immense appreciation 
was well evidenced when he received the Mae 
Reatha Coleman Citizen of the Year Award in 
August 2013 for his outstanding service. 
Mayor Whitehurst, fondly known as ‘‘Mr. 
Crestview,’’ will be remembered for his exceptional 
leadership and contributions to the Gulf 
Coast community, and his legacy will not be 
forgotten. To his family and friends, he will be 
remembered most as a loving father, grandfather, 
and great-grandfather. 

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States 
Congress, I am privileged to honor the life of 
George H. Whitehurst. My wife Vicki joins me 

in extending our sincerest condolences and 
prayers to his wife, Annelle; daughters, Angela 
and Ann; grandchildren; great-grandchildren; 
and the entire Whitehurst family. He will truly 
be missed.

RECOGNIZING NETKAL AND 
KOREAN AMERICAN SERVICE DAY 

HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to applaud the efforts of a group of 
Korean-American leaders in the United States 
as they successfully launched the first Korean-
American Service Day, (‘‘KA Service Day’’) on 
Saturday, November 8, 2014, with hundreds of 
volunteers participating in various events held 
in New York, Atlanta, Washington DC, Los Angeles 
and San Francisco. 

KA Service Day was conceived by the Network 
of Korean-American Leaders (NetKAL), a 
leadership program organized by the Center 
for Asian-Pacific Leadership at the University 
of Southern California for the purpose of incubating 
the next generation of Korean-American 
leaders. In 2014, the eighth class of leadership 
fellows convened in New York City over 
the course of six months and, as in years 
past, was challenged to come up with a community 
service project with far-reaching impact. 
The creation of ‘‘Korean-American Service 
Day’’ was an idea put forth by the 2014 
class of NetKAL fellows. 

The five-city service day aimed to encourage 
Korean-Americans across the nation to 
give back to their local communities. Some of 
the volunteer opportunities ranged from food 
pantries and meal programs to outdoor restoration 
projects. They partnered with non-
profit organizations, such as City Harvest to 
distribute fresh produce in the South Bronx 
neighborhood of my congressional district in 
New York City. From sorting donations to the 
Downtown Women’s Center in Los Angeles 
and planting trees in a community greenspace 
in Atlanta, volunteers on KA Service Day demonstrated 
their collective will and power to become 
positive agents of change in our society. 
I hope that the huge success of the inaugural 
KA Service Day will inspire thousands of dedicated 
volunteers to help grow it into one of the 
largest days of service in America. 

As a Korean War veteran, I have been 
proud to witness the Korean community flourish 
across our nation. Since 1903, when they 
first came to America, Korean immigrants 
have played a vital role in shaping our society 
through their strong family ties and hard work. 
They have inspired us with their 
entrepreneurialism and perseverance toward 
building success and wealth for their families 
and communities. As a Congressman representing 
the communities in the New York 
metropolitan area I have been greatly impressed 
by the tremendous contributions 
made by half-a-million Korean Americans and 
1,000 professional, educational, religious, and 
trade organizations, as they play a vital role in 
the Great City of New York. I am grateful to 
them and the members of NetKAL for their 
leadership in making a positive impact on our 
society.

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 23rd Anniversary of Literacy 
Volunteers of America—Prince William. 

Founded in 1991 by local librarian Dona 
Swanson to help teach a library patron to 
read, Literacy Volunteers of America—Prince 
William has maintained its direct service approach, 
by providing individualized adult literacy 
tutoring based on the personal needs 
and goals of adult learners. LVA–PW understands 
that literacy is a critical skill which can 
open the doors to educational and employment 
opportunities. As a literature major in 
college, I cannot agree more. 

LVA–PW’s programs are well-researched 
and constantly tracked and evaluated by staff 
to ensure their effectiveness. This has proven 
to be a highly successful model: in 2014, 
LVA–PW served 667 adult learners who received 
a total of 14,000 hours of instruction 
from 212 trained volunteer tutors. Many of 
these participants learned to read and write 
thereby enabling them to become full participants 
in our communities and, in many cases, 
to earn their GEDs and achieve employment. 

Literacy Volunteers of America—Prince William 
has established itself as an institution in 
the community, fostering local partnerships to 
strengthen both their own services and those 
of other community groups, including the 
Prince William County Library System, the Virginia 
Employment Center, Northern Virginia 
Community College, the Prince William County 
Adult Education Program, and local businesses 
through workplace literacy programs. 
LVA–PW has been recognized as Community 
Service Organization of the Year by the Prince 
William Regional Chamber of Commerce, Volunteer 
Organization of the Quarter by Prince 
William County, and Friday’s Hero by the local 
Channel 9 News. Literacy Volunteers of America—
Prince William is a model to be emulated. 

Each year the Literacy Volunteers of America—
Prince William recognizes individuals for 
their commitment as students, tutors, or volunteers. 
I am pleased to enter the following 
names of the 2014 honorees into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD: 

Students of the Year—Rut Amdemskal and 
Iftikhar Haq 

Tutors of the Year—Davine Irving and Linda 
Mazzucchi 

Volunteer of the Year—Ernestine Jenkins 

Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join 
me in congratulating Literacy Volunteers of 
America—Prince William on the occasion of its 
23rd Anniversary and in thanking the volunteers, 
sponsors, staff, and community partners 
for their efforts in support of this worthwhile organization. 
I also commend Vicki Gross for 
her many contributions to LVA–PW while serving 
as Executive Director. 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 

Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the exceptional career of Wilson County 
Judge Marvin Quinney. As a veteran of our 
nation’s armed services, a dedicated officer of 
the State of Texas, and as a man of God, 
Judge Quinney has and continues to faithfully 
serve the people of his county to the best of 
his ability. 

Marvin Quinney’s lifetime of public service 
began in 1965 when he joined the United 
States Army to assist military efforts in Vietnam. 
After two years in the Army, future 
Judge Quinney spent a year working in a 
Texas oilfield—a period he cites for shaping 
his strong work ethic. He returned to public 
service in 1968 as a Texas Department of 
Public Safety Trooper from 1968 until 1995. 
He later served as a Federal Court Security 
Officer in San Antonio for three years. It was 
after this period that Judge Quinney announced 
his bid for the office of Wilson County 
Judge, promising to serve the County with 
responsibility, integrity, and confidence. Since 
his election in 1998, Judge Quinney has 
stayed true to his word. Among his many 
achievements in office are the protection of 
Wilson County’s water rights, the continuation 
of low tax rates and the organization of a successful 
Sesquicentennial celebration. Currently, 
he is focused on overseeing the restoration 
of Wilson County’s beautiful, historic 
Courthouse. When he retires on December 
31, 2014, Judge Quinney will have served four 
terms in office and will leave an honorable legacy 
in his stead. 

Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have the opportunity 
to recognize Judge Marvin Quinney. 
His dedication to his nation, the state of 
Texas, and especially to the citizens of Wilson 
County is truly admirable.

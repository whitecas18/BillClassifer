United States 
of America PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATES OF THE 104th 
CONGRESS, FIRST SESSION 

Vol. 141 WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1995 No. 1 

House of Representatives 

This being the day fixed by the 20th 
amendment to the Constitution for the 
annual meeting of the Congress of the 
United States, the Members-elect of 
the 104th Congress met in their Hall, 
and at 12 noon, were called to order by 
the Clerk of the House of Representatives, 
the Honorable Donnald K. Anderson. 


The Chaplain, Rev. James David 
Ford, D.D., offered the following prayer: 


With gratefulness and praise and 
with a sense of duty and honor, we express 
our thanksgivings, O gracious 
God, that we have the opportunity to 
serve at this time and place. When we 
contemplate the demands of justice 
and the high calling to public service, 
we pray that Your spirit will illumine 
our minds, strengthen our resolve and 
give us hearts of wisdom, tolerance, 
and compassion. May each person be 
faithful to the vocation of Government 
service, that we will be good stewards 
of the resources of the land, hold to the 
standards of integrity and loyalty and 
do all those good things that honor 
You and serve people everywhere. May 
Your benediction, O God, that is new 
every morning and is with us in all the 
moments of life, continue to bless us 
and keep us in Your grace, now and evermore. 
As the prophet Micah has said, 
‘‘And what does the Lord require of 
you, but to do justice, to love mercy, 
and to walk humbly with your God.’’ 
Amen. 

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 

The CLERK. Will the Members-elect 
and their guests please remain standing 
and join with us in the Pledge of 
Allegiance to the Flag. 

The Clerk led the Pledge of Allegiance 
as follows: 

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Republic 
for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 

The CLERK. Representatives-elect, 
this is the day fixed by the 20th amendment 
to the Constitution and Public 
Law 103–395 for the meeting of the 104th 
Congress and, as the law directs, the 
Clerk of the House has prepared the official 
roll of the Representatives-elect. 

Certificates of election covering 428 
seats in the 104th Congress have been 
received by the Clerk of the House, and

FAREWELL REMARKS OF THE 

HONORABLE DONNALD K. AN


DERSON 

The CLERK. Ladies and gentlemen of 
the House, if you will indulge me for 
just one moment, I will shortly take 
leave of this Chamber after 35 years in 
your service, the last 8 in the high 
stewardship as your Clerk. 

My heart is filled with the happy reflections 
of those years, a deep sense of 
fulfillment, and profound gratitude for 
your unfailing confidence and friendship. 
Indeed, I am grateful above all to 
the one Nation which affords opportunity 
for an ordinary citizen to 
achieve extraordinary responsibility. 
You will remain constantly in my 
thoughts and in my prayers that God 
will bless each of you in the work 
which you are about and may He forever 
prosper this House and the United 
States of America. 

I bid you an affectionate farewell.

TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE 
DONNALD K. ANDERSON 

(Mr. BOEHNER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 

Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Clerk, before we 
proceed with the nominations for 
Speaker of the House, on behalf of Republican 
Members of the House, we 
want to thank you for your 35 years of 
service to this institution, and your 35 
years of service to the American people. 
You have done your job ably on behalf 
of all Members on both sides of the 
aisle. 

And to the other officers of the 
House, who have served the House so 
ably and the American people so ably, 
we want to thank them as well for 
their service in this House. 

Farewell, and best wishes from all of 
us. 

Mr. FAZIO. Will the gentleman 
yield? 

Mr. BOEHNER. I yield to my friend, 
the gentleman from California [Mr. 
FAZIO]. 

Mr. FAZIO. I appreciate my friend 
yielding. 

I, too, would like to add a few words 
of tribute to our friend. 

When the 103d Congress came to an 
official close on noon Tuesday, the 
House literally lived on for the next 24 
hours in the person of the gentleman 
from Sacramento, CA, the Clerk of the 
House, Donnald K. Anderson. In serving 
as the first presiding officer for the 
purpose of organizing the 104th Congress, 
he fulfilled his last ministerial 
duty to this institution. After four successive 
terms as Clerk and a career 
with the House that began as a Page 
when Dwight Eisenhower was President 
and Sam Rayburn sat in the 
Speaker’s chair, Donn Anderson now 
leaves a distinguished career of public 
service. 

On a personal level for many of us in 
this Chamber, it was only natural for 
Donn Anderson to have been the thread 
of continuity from one Congress to the 
next. For over 30 years, Donn has embodied 
every good virtue of this House. 
He has been its memory, its defender, 
its champion and often its conscience. 
He understood perhaps better than 
anyone here the meaning of the word 
‘‘bipartisanship’’ and he lived it daily 
in his work with the Members. In his 8 
years as the second highest ranking officer 
of the House, he worked tirelessly 
to move the House into the information 
age and so greatly benefited our 
constituents, the American people. 

As chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Legislative Appropriations, I looked 
forward to our annual ritual of hearings 
knowing that I could always count 
on the Clerk for the most splendid testimony. 
Although Donn himself admitted 
to his preference for Victorian 
manners, there was nothing old-fashioned 
about the direction of his office. 
He was thoroughly modern in his vi-

times. Just as Donn could explain the 
artistic nuances of paintings in the Rotunda, 
he could just as easily give you 
the technical lowdown of cameras in 
this Chamber and on this floor. As the 
House moves forward today with the 
institutional reforms and the reorganization, 
we do so with the solid foundation 
left behind by Donn Anderson. 

Perhaps in parting we can borrow a 
phrase from our late and great Speaker 
Tip O’Neill. He simply said on so many 
occasions, ‘‘So long, old pal.’’ 

Thank you, Donn Anderson. 

f 


ELECTION OF SPEAKER 

The CLERK. The next order of business 
is the election of the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives for the 
104th Congress. 

Nominations are now in order. 

The Clerk recognizes the gentleman 
from Ohio [Mr. BOEHNER]. 

Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Clerk, as chairman 
of the Republican Conference, I 
am honored and privileged to welcome 
my colleagues and the American people 
to this historic day. We have been sent 
here—to the People’s House—to write, 
together, a new chapter in our blessed 
Nation’s history. There is great anticipation, 
excitement, and expectation in 
America about what this new chapter 
will say. To America I say, we shall 
write the chapter as you dictate it to 
us. This is your House and your will 
will be reflected in our actions. 

As the first sentence of this new 
chapter, I am directed by the unanimous 
vote of the Republican Conference 
to present the name of the Honorable 
NEWT GINGRICH, a Representative-
elect from the State of Georgia, 
for election to the Office of the Speaker 
of the House of Representatives for 
the 104th Congress. 

The CLERK. The Clerk now recognizes 
the gentleman from California [Mr. 
FAZIO]. 

Mr. FAZIO. Mr. Clerk, as chairman of 
the Democratic Caucus, I am directed 
by the unanimous vote of that caucus 
to present for election to the Office of 
the Speaker of the House of Representatives 
for the 104th Congress the name 
of the Honorable RICHARD A. GEPHARDT, 
a Representative-elect from the 
State of Missouri. I am proud to so 
make that nomination. 

b1240 

The CLERK. The Honorable NEWT 
GINGRICH, a Representative-elect from 
the State of Georgia, and the Honorable 
RICHARD A. GEPHARDT, a Representative-
elect from the State of 
Missouri, have been placed in nomination. 


Are there any further nominations? 

There being no further nominations, 
the Clerk will appoint tellers. 

The Chair appoints the gentleman 
from California [Mr. THOMAS], the gentleman 
from California [Mr. FAZIO], the 
gentlewoman from New Jersey [Mrs. 

The tellers will come forward and 
take their seats at the desk in the 
front of the Speaker’s rostrum. 

The roll will now be called, and those 
responding to their names will indicate 
by surname the nominee of their 
choice. 

The reading clerk will now call the 
roll. 

The tellers having taken their places,

b1310 

The CLERK. If there are any Representatives-
elect who did not answer 
the rollcall, they may come to the well 
and vote at this time. 

The tellers agree in their tallies that 
the total number of votes cast is 434, of 
which the Honorable NEWT GINGRICH of 
the State of Georgia has received 228 
and the honorable RICHARD A. GEPHARDT 
of the State of Missouri has received 
202, with 4 voting ‘‘present.’’ 

Therefore, the Honorable NEWT GINGRICH 
of the State of Georgia is duly 
elected Speaker of the House of Representatives 
for the 104th Congress, 
having received a majority of the votes 
cast. 

The Clerk appoints the following 
committee to escort the Speaker-elect 
to the chair: The gentleman from Missouri 
[Mr. GEPHARDT], the gentleman 
from Texas [Mr. ARMEY], the gentleman 
from Texas [Mr. DELAY], the 
gentleman from Michigan [Mr. 
BONIOR], the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. 
BOEHNER], the gentleman from California 
[Mr. FAZIO], the gentleman from 
Georgia [Mr. COLLINS], the gentleman 
from Georgia [Mr. LEWIS], the gentleman 
from Georgia [Mr. BISHOP], the 
gentleman from Georgia [Mr. DEAL], 
the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. 
KINGSTON], the gentleman from Georgia 
[Mr. LINDER], the gentlewoman 
from Georgia [Ms. MCKINNEY], the gentleman 
from Georgia [Mr. BARR], the 
gentleman from Georgia [Mr. 
CHAMBLISS], and the gentleman from 
Georgia [Mr. NORWOOD]. 

The committee will retire from the 
Chamber to escort the Speaker-elect to 
the chair. 

The Doorkeeper announced the 
Speaker-elect of the House of Representatives 
of the 104th Congress, who 
was escorted to the chair by the committee 
of escort. 

Mr. GEPHARDT. Mr. Speaker, let me 
say to the ladies and gentleman of the 
House that I first want to thank my 
Democratic colleagues for their support 
and their confidence. I noted we 
were a little short, but I appreciate 
your friendship and your support. 

As you might imagine, this is not a 
moment that I had been waiting for. 
When you carry the mantle of progress, 
there is precious little glory in defeat. 
But sometimes we spend so much time 
lionizing the winners and labeling the 
losers, we lose sight of the victory we 
all share in this crown jewel of democracy. 


You see, Mr. Speaker, this is a day to 
celebrate a power that belongs not to 
any political party, but to the people, 
no matter the margin, no matter the 
majority. All across the world, from 
Bosnia to Chechnya to South Africa, 
people lay down their lives for the kind 
of voice we take for granted. Too often 
the transfer of power is an act of pain 
and carnage, not one as we see today of 
peace and decency. 

b1330 

But here in the House of Representatives, 
for 219 years, longer than any democracy 
in the world, we heed the people’s 
voice with peace and civility and 
respect. Each and every day, on this 
very floor, we echo the hopes and 
dreams of our people, their fears and 
their failures, their abiding belief in a 
better America. 

We may not all agree with today’s 
changing of the guard. We may not all 
like it, but we enact the people’s will 
with dignity and honor and pride. In 

agreements sometimes not even possible. 
However, while we may not agree 
on matters of party and principle, we 
all abide with the will of the people. 
That is reason enough to place our 
good faith and our best hopes in your 
able hands. 

I speak from the bottom of my heart 
when I say that I wish you the best in 
these coming 2 years, for when this 
gavel passes into your hands, so do the 
futures and fortunes of millions of 
Americans. To make real progress, to 
improve real people’s lives, we both 
have to rise above partisanship. We 
have to work together were we can and 
where we must. 

It is a profound responsibility, one 
which knows no bounds in party or politics. 
It is the responsibility not merely 
for those who voted for you, not 
merely for those who cast their fate on 
your side of the aisle, but also for those 
who did not. 

These are the responsibilities I pass, 
along with the gavel I hold, will hold in 
my hand, but there are some burdens 
that the Democratic Party will never 
cease to bear. As Democrats, we came 
to Congress to fight for America’s 
hard-working middle-income families, 
the families who are working, often for 
longer hours, for less pay, for fewer 
benefits in jobs they are not sure they 
can keep. 

We, together, must redeem their 
faith that if they work hard and they 
play by the rules they can build a better 
life for their children. Mr. Speaker, 
I want this entire House to speak for 
those families. The Democratic Party 
will. That mantle we will never lay to 
rest. 

So with partnership but with purpose, 
I pass this great gavel of our Government. 
With resignation, but with 
resolve, I hereby end 40 years of Democratic 
rule of this House; with faith 
and with friendship and the deepest respect. 
You are now my Speaker, and let 
the great debate begin. 

I now have the high honor and distinct 
privilege to present to the House 
of Representatives our new Speaker, 
the gentleman from Georgia, NEWT 
GINGRICH. 

Mr. GINGRICH. Let me say first of 
all that I am deeply grateful to my 
good friend, DICK GEPHARDT. When my 
side maybe overreacted to your statement 
about ending 40 years of Democratic 
rule, I could not help but look 
over at Bob Michel, who has often been 
up here and who knows that everything 
DICK said was true. This is difficult and 
painful to lose, and on my side of the 
aisle, we have for 20 elections been on 
the losing side. Yet there is something 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5 

so wonderful about the process by 
which a free people decides things. 

In my own case, I lost two elections, 
and with the good help of my friend VIC 
FAZIO came close to losing two others. 
I am sorry, guys, it just did not quite 
work out. Yet I can tell you that every 
time when the polls closed and I waited 
for the votes to come in, I felt good, because 
win or lose, we have been part of 
this process. 

In a little while, I am going to ask 
the dean of the House, JOHN DINGELL, 
to swear me in, to insist on the bipartisan 
nature of the way in which we together 
work in this House. JOHN’s father 
was one of the great stalwarts of 
the New Deal, a man who, as an FDR 
Democrat, created modern America. I 
think that JOHN and his father represent 
a tradition that we all have to 
recognize and respect, and recognize 
that the America we are now going to 
try to lead grew from that tradition 
and is part of that great heritage. 

I also want to take just a moment to 
thank Speaker Foley, who was extraordinarily 
generous, both in his public 
utterances and in everything that he 
and Mrs. Foley did to help Marianne 
and me, and to help our staff make the 
transition. I think that he worked very 
hard to reestablish the dignity of the 
House. We can all be proud of the reputation 
that he takes and of the spirit 
with which he led the speakership. Our 
best wishes go to Speaker and Mrs. 
Foley. 

I also want to thank the various 
house officers, who have been just extraordinary. 
I want to say for the public 
record that faced with a result none 
of them wanted, in a situation I suspect 
none of them expected, that within 
48 hours every officer of this House 
reacted as a patriot, worked overtime, 
bent over backwards, and in every way 
helped us. I am very grateful, and this 
House I think owes a debt of gratitude 
to every officer that the Democrats 
elected 2 years ago. 

This is a historic moment. I was 
asked over and over, how did it feel, 
and the only word that comes close to 
adequate is overwhelming. I feel overwhelmed 
in every way, overwhelmed by 
all the Georgians who came up, overwhelmed 
by my extended family that is 
here, overwhelmed by the historic moment. 
I walked out and stood on the 
balcony just outside of the Speaker’s 
office, looking down the Mall this 
morning, very early. I was just overwhelmed 
by the view, with two men I 
will introduce and know very, very 
well. Just the sense of being part of 
America, being part of this great tradition, 
is truly overwhelming. 

I have two gavels. Actually, DICK 
happened to use one. Maybe this was 
appropriate. This was a Georgia gavel I 
just got this morning, done by Dorsey 
Newman of Tallapoosa. He decided that 
the gavels he saw on TV weren’t big 
enough or strong enough, so he cut 
down a walnut tree in his backyard, 
make a gavel, put a commemorative 
item on it, and sent it up here. 

So this is a genuine Georgia gavel, 
and I am the first Georgia Speaker in 
over 100 years. The last one, by the 
way, had a weird accent, too. Speaker 
Crisp was born in Britain. His parents 
were actors and they came to the United 
States—a good word, by the way, for 
the value we get from immigration. 

Second, this is the gavel that Speaker 
Martin used. I am not sure what it 
says about the inflation of Government, 
to put them side by side, but this 
was the gavel used by the last Republican 
Speaker. 

I want to comment for a minute on 
two men who served as my leaders, 
from whom I learned so much and who 
are here today. When I arrived as a 
freshman, the Republican Party, deeply 
dispirited by Watergate and by the 
loss of the Presidency, banded together 
and worked with a leader who helped 
pave the way for our great party victory 
of 1980, a man who just did a marvelous 
job. I cannot speak too highly of 
what I learned about integrity and 
leadership and courage from serving 
with him in my freshman term. He is 
here with us again today. I hope all of 
you will recognize Congressman John 
Rhodes of Arizona. 

b1340 

I want to say also that at our request, 
the second person was not sure 
he should be here at all, then he 
thought he was going to hide in the 
back of the room. I insisted that he 
come on down front, someone whom I 
regard as a mentor. I think virtually 
every Democrat in the House would say 
he is a man who genuinely cares about, 
loves the House, and represents the 
best spirit of the House. He is a man 
who I studied under and, on whom I 
hope as Speaker I can always rely for 
advice. I hope frankly I can emulate 
his commitment to this institution and 
his willingness to try to reach beyond 
his personal interest and partisanship. 
I hope all of you will join me in thanking 
for his years of service, Congressman 
Bob Michel of Illinois. 

I am very fortunate today. My mom 
and my dad are here, they are right up 
there in the gallery. Bob and Kit Gingrich. 
I am so delighted that they were 
both able to be here. Sometimes when 
you get to my age, you cannot have everyone 
near you that you would like to 
have. I cannot say how much I learned 
from my Dad and his years of serving 
in the U.S. Army and how much I 
learned from my Mother, who is clearly 
my most enthusiastic cheerleader. 

My daughters are here up in the gallery, 
too. They are Kathy Lovewith and 
her husband Paul, and Jackie and her 
husban Mark Zyler. Of course, the person 
who clearly is my closest friend 
and my best adviser and whom if I listened 
to about 20 percent more, I would 
get in less trouble, my wife Marianne, 
is in the gallery as well. 

I have a very large extended family 
between Marianne and me. They are 
virtually all in town, and we have done 
our part for the Washington tourist 
season. But I could not help, when I 

first came on the floor earlier, I saw a 
number of the young people who are 
here. I met a number of the children 
who are on the floor and the young 
adults, who are close to 12 years of age. 
I could not help but think that sitting 
in the back rail near the center of the 
House is one of my nephews, Kevin 
McPherson, who is 5. My nieces Susan 
Brown, who is 6, and Emily Brown, who 
is 8, and Laura McPherson, who is 9, 
are all back there, too. That is probably 
more than I was allowed to bring 
on, but they are my nieces and my 
nephews. I have two other nephews a 
little older who are sitting in the gallery. 


I could not help but think as a way I 
wanted to start the Speakership and to 
talk to every Member, that in a sense 
these young people around us are what 
this institution is really all about. 
Much more than the negative advertising 
and the interest groups and all the 
different things that make politics all 
too often cynical, nasty, and sometimes 
frankly just plan miserable, 
what makes politics worthwhile is the 
choice, as DICK GEPHARDT said, between 
what we see so tragically on the 
evening news and the way we try to 
work very hard to make this system of 
free, representative self-government 
work. The ultimate reason for doing 
that is these children, the country they 
will inherit, and the world they will 
live in. 

We are starting the 104th Congress. I 
do not know if you have every thought 
about this, but for 208 years, we bring 
together the most diverse country in 
the history of the world. We send all 
sorts of people here. Each of us could 
find at least one Member we thought 
was weird. I will tell you, if you went 
around the room the person chosen to 
be weird would be different for virtually 
every one of us. Because we do 
allow and insist upon the right of a free 
people to send an extraordinary diversity 
of people here. 

Brian Lamb of C–SPAN read to me 
Friday a phrase from de Tocqueville 
that was so central to the House. I 
have been reading Remini’s biography 
of Henry Clay and Clay, as the first 
strong Speaker, always preferred the 
House. He preferred the House to the 
Senate although he served in both. He 
said the House is more vital, more active, 
more dynamic, and more common. 


This is what de Tocqueville wrote: 
‘‘Often there is not a distinguished 
man in the whole number. Its members 
are almost all obscure individuals 
whose names bring no associations to 
mind. They are mostly village lawyers, 
men in trade, or even persons belonging 
to the lower classes of society.’’ 

If we include women, I do not know 
that we would change much. But the 
word ‘‘vulgar’’ in de Tocqueville’s time 
had a very particular meaning. It is a 
meaning the world would do well to 
study in this room. You see, de 
Tocqueville was an aristocrat. He lived 


H6 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 1995 

in a world of kings and princes. The 
folks who come here do so by the one 
single act that their citizens freely 
chose them. I do not care what your 
ethnic background is, or your ideology. 
I do not care if you are younger or 
older. I do not care if you are born in 
America of if you are a naturalized citizen. 
Everyone of the 435 people have 
equal standing because their citizens 
freely sent them. Their voice should be 
heard and they should have a right to 
participate. It is the most marvelous 
act of a complex giant country trying 
to argue and talk. And, as DICK GEPHARDT 
said, to have a great debate, to 
reach great decisions, not through a 
civil war, not by bombing one of our regional 
capitals, not by killing a half 
million people, and not by having snipers. 
Let me say unequivocally, I condemn 
all acts of violence against the 
law by all people for all reasons. This is 
a society of law and a society of civil 
behavior. 

Here we are as commoners together, 
to some extent Democrats and Republicans, 
to some extent liberals and conservatives, 
but Americans all. STEVE 
GUNDERSON today gave me a copy of 
the ‘‘Portable Abraham Lincoln.’’ He 
suggested there is much for me to learn 
about our party, but I would also say 
that it does not hurt to have a copy of 
the portable F.D.R. 

This is a great country of great people. 
If there is any one factor or acts of 
my life that trikes me as I stand up 
here as the first Republican in 40 years 
to do so. When I first became whip in 
1989, Russia was beginning to change, 
the Soviet Union as it was then. Into 
my whip’s office one day came eight 
Russians and a Lithuanian, members of 
the Communist Party, newspaper editors. 
They asked me, ‘‘What does a 
whip do?’’ 

They said, ‘‘In Russia we have never 
had a free parliament since 1917 and 
that was only for a few months, so 
what do you do?’’ 

I tried to explain, as DAVE BONIOR or 
TOM DELAY might now. It is a little 
strange if you are from a dictatorship 
to explain you are called the whip but 
you do not really have a whip, you are 
elected by the people you are supposed 
to pressure—other members. If you 
pressure them too much they will not 
reelect you. On the other hand If you 
do not pressure them enough they will 
not reelect you. Democracy is hard. It 
if frustrating. 

So our group came into the Chamber. 
The Lithuanian was a man in his late 
sixties, and I allowed him to come up 
here and sit and be Speaker, something 
many of us have done with constituents. 
Remember, this is the very beginning 
of perestroika and glasnost. When 
he came out of the chair, he was physically 
trembling. He was almost in 
tears. He said, ‘‘Ever since World War 
II, I have remembered what the Americans 
did and I have never believed the 
propaganda. But I have to tell you, I 
did not think in my life that I would be 
able to sit at the center of freedom.’’ 

It was one of the most overwhelming, 
compelling moments of my life. It 
struck me that something I could not 
help but think of when we were here 
with President Mandela. I went over 
and saw RON DELLUMS and thought of 
the great work RON had done to extend 
freedom across the planet. You get 
that sense of emotion when you see 
something so totally different than you 
had expected. Here was a man who reminded 
me first of all that while presidents 
are important, they are in effect 
an elected kingship, that this and the 
other body across the way are where 
freedom has to be fought out. That is 
the tradition I hope that we will take 
with us as we go to work. 

Today we had a bipartisan prayer 
service. FRANK WOLF made some very 
important points. He said, ‘‘We have to 
recognize that many of our most painful 
problems as a country are moral 
problems, problems of dealing with 
ourselves and with life.’’ 

b1350 

He said character is the key to leadership 
and we have to deal with that. 
He preached a little bit. I do not think 
he thought he was preaching, but he 
was. It was about a spirit of reconciliation. 
He talked about caring about 
our spouses and our children and our 
families. If we are not prepared to 
model our own family life beyond just 
having them here for 1 day, if we are 
not prepared to care about our children 
and we are not prepared to care about 
our families, then by what arrogance 
do we think we will transcend our behavior 
to care about others? That is 
why with Congressman GEPHARDT’s 
help we have established a bipartisan 
task force on the family. We have established 
the principle that we are 
going to set schedules we stick to so 
families can count on time to be together, 
built around school schedules 
so that families can get to know each 
other, and not just by seeing us on C– 
SPAN. 

I will also say that means one of the 
strongest recommendations of the bipartisan 
committee, is that we have 17 
minutes to vote. This is the bipartisan 
committee’s recommendations, not 
just mine. They pointed out that if we 
take the time we spent in the last Congress 
where we waited for one more 
Member, and one more, and one more, 
that we literally can shorten the business 
and get people home if we will be 
strict and firm. At one point this year 
we had a 45-minute vote. I hope all of 
my colleagues are paying attention because 
we are in fact going to work very 
hard to have 17 minute votes and it is 
over. So, leave on the first bell, not the 
second bell. OK? This may seem particularly 
inappropriate to say on the 
first day because this will be the busiest 
day on opening day in congressional 
history. 

I want to read just a part of the Contract 
With America. I don’t mean this 
as a partisan act, but rather to remind 
all of us what we are about to go 
through and why. Those of us who 

ended up in the majority stood on 
these steps and signed a contract, and 
here is part of what it says: 

On the first day of the 104th Congress the 
new Republican majority will immediately 
pass the following reforms aimed at restoring 
the faith and trust of the American people 
in their government: First, require all 
laws that apply to the rest of the country 
also to apply equally to the Congress. Second, 
select a major, independent auditing 
firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of the 
Congress for waste, fraud or abuse. Third, 
cut the number of House committees and cut 
committee staffs by a third. Fourth, limit 
the terms of all committee chairs. Fifth, ban 
the casting of proxy votes in committees. 
Sixth, require committee meetings to be 
open to the public. Seven, require a three-
fifths majority vote to pass a tax increase. 
Eight, guarantee an honest accounting of 
our federal budget by implementing zero 
baseline budgeting. 

Now, I told DICK GEPHARDT last night 
that if I had to do it over again we 
would have pledged within 3 days that 
we will do these things, but that is not 
what we said. So we have ourselves in 
a little bit of a box here. 

Then we go a step further. I carry the 

T.V. Guide version of the contract with 
me at all times. 
We then say that within the first 100 
days of the 104th Congress we shall 
bring to the House floor the following 
bills, each to be given full and open debate, 
each to be given a full and clear 
vote, and each to be immediately available 
for inspection. We made it available 
that day. We listed 10 items. A 
balanced budget amendment and line-
item veto, a bill to stop violent criminals, 
emphasizing among other things 
an effective and enforceable death penalty. 
Third was welfare reform. Fourth, 
legislation protecting our kids. Fifth 
was to provide tax cuts for families. 
Sixth was a bill to strengthen our national 
defense. Seventh was a bill to 
raise the senior citizens’ earning limit. 
Eighth was legislation rolling back 
Government regulations. Ninth was a 
commonsense legal reform bill, and 
tenth was congressional term limits 
legislation. 

Our commitment on our side, and 
this is an absolute obligation, is first of 
all to work today until we are done. I 
know that is going to inconvenience 
people who have families and supporters. 
But we were hired to do a job, and 
we have to start today to prove we will 
do it. Second, I would say to our 
friends in the Democratic Party that 
we are going to work with you, and we 
are really laying out a schedule working 
with the minority leader to make 
sure that we can set dates certain to go 
home. That does mean that if 2 or 3 
weeks out we are running short we 
will, frankly, have longer sessions on 
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. 
We will try to work this out on a bipartisan 
basis to, in a workmanlike way, 
get it done. It is going to mean the 
busiest early months since 1933. 

Beyond the Contract I think there 
are two giant challenges. I know I am 
a partisan figure. But I really hope 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7 

today that I can speak for a minute to 
my friends in the Democratic Party as 
well as my own colleagues, and speak 
to the country about these two challenges 
so that I hope we can have a real 
dialog. One challenge is to achieve a 
balanced budget by 2002. I think both 
Democratic and Republican Governors 
will say we can do that but it is hard. 
I do not think we can do it in a year or 
two. I do not think we ought to lie to 
the American people. This is a huge, 
complicated job. 

The second challenge is to find a way 
to truly replace the current welfare 
state with an opportunity society. 

Let me talk very briefly about both 
challenges. First, on the balanced 
budget I think we can get it done. I 
think the baby boomers are now old 
enough that we can have an honest dialog 
about priorities, about resources, 
about what works, and what does not 
work. Let me say I have already told 
Vice President GORE that we are going 
to invite him to address a Republican 
conference. We would have invited him 
in December but he had to go to Moscow, 
I believe there are grounds for us 
to talk together and to work together, 
to have hearings together, and to have 
task forces together. If we set priorities, 
if we apply the principles of Edwards 
Deming and of Peter Drucker we 
can build on the Vice President’s 
reinventing government effort and we 
can focus on transforming, not just 
cutting. The choice becomes not just 
do you want more or do you want less, 
but are there ways to do it better? Can 
we learn from the private sector, can 
we learn from Ford, IBM, from 
Microsoft, from what General Motors 
has had to go through? I think on a bipartisan 
basis we owe it to our children 
and grandchildren to get this Government 
in order and to be able to actually 
pay our way. I think 2002 is a reasonable 
timeframe. I would hope that 
together we could open a dialog with 
the American people. 

I have said that I think Social Security 
ought to be off limits, at least for 
the first 4 to 6 years of the process, because 
I think it will just destroy us if 
we try to bring it into the game. But 
let me say about everything else, 
whether it is Medicare, or it is agricultural 
subsidies, or it is defense or anything 
that I think the greatest Democratic 
President of the 20th century, 
and in my judgment the greatest President 
of the 20th century, said it right. 
On March 4, 1933, he stood in braces as 
a man who had polio at a time when 
nobody who had that kind of disability 
could be anything in public life. He was 
President of the United States, and he 
stood in front of this Capitol on a rainy 
March day and he said, ‘‘We have nothing 
to fear but fear itself.’’ I want 
every one of us to reach out in that 
spirit and pledge to live up to that spirit, 
and I think frankly on a bipartisan 
basis. I would say to Members of the 
Black and Hispanic Caucuses that I 
would hope we could arrange by late 
spring to genuinely share districts. 

You could have a Republican who 
frankly may not know a thing about 
your district agree to come for a long 
weekend with you, and you will agree 
to go for a long weekend with them. We 
begin a dialog and an openness that is 
totally different than people are used 
to seeing in politics in America. I believe 
if we do that we can then create 
a dialog that can lead to a balanced 
budget. 

But I think we have a greater challenge. 
I do want to pick up directly on 
what DICK GEPHARDT said, because he 
said it right. No Republican here 
should kid themselves about it. The 
greatest leaders in fighting for an integrated 
America in the 20th century 
were in the Democratic Party. The fact 
is, it was the liberal wing of the Democratic 
Party that ended segregation. 
The fact is that it was Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt who gave hope to a Nation 
that was in distress and could have slid 
into dictatorship. Every Republican 
has much to learn from studying what 
the Democrats did right. 

But I would say to my friends in the 
Democratic Party that there is much 
to what Ronald Reagan was trying to 
get done. There is much to what is 
being done today by Republicans like 
Bill Weld, and John Engler, and 
Tommy Thompson, and George Allen, 
and Christy Whitman, and Pete Wilson. 
There is much we can share with each 
other. 

We must replace the welfare state 
with an opportunity society. The balanced 
budget is the right thing to do. 
But it does not in my mind have the 
moral urgency of coming to grips with 
what is happening to the poorest Americans. 


I commend to all Marvin Olasky’s 
‘‘The Tragedy of American Compassion.’’ 
Olasky goes back for 300 years 
and looked at what has worked in 
America, how we have helped people 
rise beyond poverty, and how we have 
reached out to save people. He may not 
have the answers, but he has the right 
sense of where we have to go as Americans. 


b1400 

I do not believe that there is a single 
American who can see a news report of 
a 4-year-old thrown off of a public 
housing project in Chicago by other 
children and killed and not feel that a 
part of your heart went, too. I think of 
my nephew in the back, Kevin, and how 
all of us feel about our children. How 
can any American read about an 11year-
old buried with his Teddy bear because 
he killed a 14-year-old, and then 
another 14-year-old killed him, and not 
have some sense of ‘‘My God, where has 
this country gone?’’ How can we not 
decide that this is a moral crisis equal 
to segregation, equal to slavery? How 
can we not insist that every day we 
take steps to do something? 

I have seldom been more shaken than 
I was after the election when I had 
breakfast with two members of the 
Black Caucus. One of them said to me, 
‘‘Can you imagine what it is like to 

visit a first-grade class and realize that 
every fourth or fifth young boy in that 
class may be dead or in jail within 15 
years? And they are your constituents 
and you are helpless to change it?’’ For 
some reason, I do not know why, 
maybe because I visit a lot of schools, 
that got through. I mean, that personalized 
it. That made it real, not just 
statistics, but real people. 

Then I tried to explain part of my 
thoughts by talking about the need for 
alternatives to the bureaucracy, and 
we got into what I think frankly has 
been a pretty distorted and cheap debate 
over orphanages. 

Let me say, first of all, my father, 
who is here today, was a foster child. 
He was adopted as a teenager. I am 
adopted. We have relatives who were 
adopted. We are not talking out of 
some vague impersonal Dickens ‘‘Bleak 
House’’ middle-class intellectual 
model. We have lived the alternatives. 

I believe when we are told that children 
are so lost in the city bureaucracies 
that there are children who end 
up in dumpsters, when we are told that 
there are children doomed to go to 
schools where 70 or 80 percent of them 
will not graduate, when we are told of 
public housing projects that are so dangerous 
that if any private sector ran 
them they would be put in jail, and the 
only solution we are given is, ‘‘Well, we 
will study it, we will get around to it,’’ 
my only point is that this is unacceptable. 
We can find ways immediately to 
do things better, to reach out, break 
through the bureaucracy and give 
every young American child a better 
chance. 

Let me suggest to you Morris 
Schectman’s new book. I do not agree 
with all of it, but it is fascinating. It is 
entitled ‘‘Working Without a Net.’’ It 
is an effort to argue that in the 21st 
century we have to create our own 
safety nets. He draws a distinction between 
caring and caretaking. It is 
worth every American reading. 

He said caretaking is when you bother 
me a little bit, and I do enough, I 
feel better because I think I took care 
of you. That is not any good to you at 
all. You may be in fact an alcoholic 
and I just gave you the money to buy 
the bottle that kills you, but I feel better 
and go home. He said caring is actually 
stopping and dealing with the 
human being, trying to understand 
enough about them to genuinely make 
sure you improve their life, even if you 
have to start with a conversation like, 
‘‘If you will quit drinking, I will help 
you get a job.’’ This is a lot harder conversation 
than, ‘‘I feel better. I gave 
him a buck or 5 bucks.’’ 

I want to commend every Member on 
both sides to look carefully. I say to 
those Republicans who believe in total 
privatization, you cannot believe in the 
Good Samaritan and explain that as 
long as business is making money we 
can walk by a fellow American who is 
hurt and not do something. I would say 
to my friends on the left who believe

there has never been a government pro-to make men holy, let us live to make (Applause, the Members rising.) 

gram that was not worth keeping, you men free.’’ 

b1410

cannot look at some of the results we It is not just political freedom, al


now have and not want to reach out to 
the humans and forget the bureaucracies. 


If we could build that attitude on 
both sides of this aisle, we would be an 
amazingly different place, and the 
country would begin to be a different 
place. 

We have to create a partnership. We 
have to reach out to the American people. 
We are going to do a lot of important 
things. Thanks to the House Information 
System and Congressman VERN 
EHLERS, as of today we are going to be 
on line for the whole country, every 
amendment, every conference report. 
We are working with C–SPAN and others, 
and Congressman GEPHARDT has 
agreed to help on a bipartisan basis to 
make the building more open to television, 
more accessible to the American 
people. We have talk radio hosts 
here today for the first time. I hope to 
have a bipartisan effort to make the 
place accessible for all talk radio hosts 
of all backgrounds, no matter their ideology. 
The House Historian’s office is 
going to be more aggressively run on a 
bipartisan basis to reach out to Close 
Up, and to other groups to teach what 
the legislative struggle is about. I 
think over time we can and will this 
Spring rethink campaign reform and 
lobbying reform and review all ethics, 
including the gift rule. 

But that isn’t enough. Our challenge 
shouldn’t be just to balance the budget 
or to pass the Contract. Our challenge 
should not be anything that is just legislative. 
We are supposed to, each one 
of us, be leaders. I think our challenge 
has to be to set as our goal, and maybe 
we are not going to get there in 2 
years. This ought to be the goal that 
we go home and we tell people we believe 
in: that there will be a Monday 
morning when for the entire weekend 
not a single child was killed anywhere 
in America; that there will be a Monday 
morning when every child in the 
country went to a school that they and 
their parents thought prepared them as 
citizens and prepared them to compete 
in the world market; that there will be 
a Monday morning where it was easy 
to find a job or create a job, and your 
own Government did not punish you if 
you tried. 

We should not be happy just with the 
language of politicians and the language 
of legislation. We should insist 
that our success for America is felt in 
the neighborhoods, in the communities, 
is felt by real people living real 
lives who can say, ‘‘Yes, we are safer, 
we are healthier, we are better educated, 
America succeeds.’’ 

This morning’s closing hymn at the 
prayer service was the Battle Hymn of 
the Republic. It is hard to be in this 
building, look down past Grant to the 
Lincoln Memorial and not realize how 
painful and how difficult that battle 
hymn is. The key phrase is, ‘‘As he died 

though I agree with everything Congressman 
GEPHARDT said earlier. If you 
cannot afford to leave the public housing 
project, you are not free. If you do 
not know how to find a job and do not 
know how to create a job, you are not 
free. If you cannot find a place that 
will educate you, you are not free. If 
you are afraid to walk to the store because 
you could get killed, you are not 
free. 

So as all of us over the coming 
months sing that song, ‘‘As he died to 
make men holy, let us live to make 
men free,’’ I want us to dedicate ourselves 
to reach out in a genuinely nonpartisan 
way to be honest with each 
other. I promise each of you that without 
regard to party my door is going to 
be open. I will listen to each of you. I 
will try to work with each of you. I 
will put in long hours, and I will guarantee 
that I will listen to you first. I 
will let you get it all out before I give 
you my version, because you have been 
patient with me today, and you have 
given me a chance to set the stage. 

But I want to close by reminding all 
of us of how much bigger this is than 
us. Because beyond talking with the 
American people, beyond working together, 
I think we can only be successful 
if we start with our limits. I was 
very struck this morning with something 
Bill Emerson used, a very famous 
quote of Benjamin Franklin, at the 
point where the Constitutional Convention 
was deadlocked. People were tired, 
and there was a real possibility that 
the Convention was going to break up. 
Franklin, who was quite old and had 
been relatively quiet for the entire 
Convention, suddenly stood up and was 
angry, and he said : 

I have lived, sir, a long time, and the 
longer I live the more convincing proofs I see 
of this truth, that God governs in the affairs 
of men, and if a sparrow cannot fall to the 
ground without His notice, is it possible that 
an empire can rise without His aid? 

At that point the Constitutional Convention 
stopped. They took a day off 
for fasting and prayer. 

Then, having stopped and come together, 
they went back, and they 
solved the great question of large and 
small States. They wrote the Constitution, 
and the United States was created. 
All I can do is pledge to you that, 
if each of us will reach out prayerfully 
and try to genuinely understand each 
other, if we will recognize that in this 
building we symbolize America, and 
that we have an obligation to talk with 
each other, then I think a year from 
now we can look on the 104th Congress 
as a truly amazing institution without 
regard to party, without regard to ideology. 
We can say, ‘‘Here, America 
comes to work, and here we are preparing 
for those children a better future.’’ 

Thank you. Good luck and God bless 
you. 

Let me now call on the gentleman 
from Michigan [Mr. DINGELL]. 

I am now ready to take the oath of 
office. I ask the dean of the House of 
Representatives, the Honorable JOHN 

D. DINGELL of Michigan, to administer 
the oath of office. 
Mr. DINGELL then administered the 
oath of office to Mr. GINGRICH of Georgia, 
as follows: 

Do you solemnly swear that you will 
support and defend the Constitution of 
the United States against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic; that you will 
bear true faith and allegiance to the 
same; that you take this obligation 
freely, without any mental reservation 
or purpose of evasion, and that you will 
well and faithfully discharge the duties 
of the office on which you are about to 
enter. So help you God. 

(Applause, the Members rising.)

precedent, the Chair will swear in all 
Members of the House at this time and,

There was no objection. 

The SPEAKER. If the Members will 
rise, the Chair will now administer the 
oath of office. 

The Members-elect and Delegates-
elect and the Resident Commissioner-
elect rose, and the Speaker administered 
the oath of office to them, as follows: 


Do you solemnly swear that you will 
support and defend the Constitution of 
the United States against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic; that you will 
bear true faith and allegiance to the 
same; that you take this obligation 
freely, without any mental reservation 
or purpose of evasion, and that you will 
well and faithfully discharge the duties 
of the office on which you are about to 
enter. So help you God. 

Congratulations, the gentlemen and

MAKING IN ORDER IMMEDIATE 
CONSIDERATION OF HOUSE RESOLUTION 
ADOPTING THE RULES 
OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
FOR THE 104TH CONGRESS 

Mr. ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that it be in order 
immediately to consider in the House a 
resolution adopting the rules of the 
House of Representatives for the 104th 
Congress; that the resolution be considered 
as read; that the resolution be 
debatable initially for 30 minutes, to be 
equally divided and controlled by the 
majority leader and the minority leader, 
or their designees; that the previous 
question be considered as ordered on 
the resolution to final adoption without 
intervening motion or demand for 
division of the question, except that 
the question of adopting the resolution 
shall be divided among nine parts, to 
wit: Each of the eight sections of title 
I, and then title II; each portion of the 
divided question shall be debatable separately 
for 20 minutes, to be equally divided 
and controlled by the majority 
leader and the minority leader, or their 
designees, and shall be disposed of in 
the order stated, but if the yeas and 
nays are ordered on the question of 
adopting any portion of the divided 
question, the Speaker may postpone 
further proceedings on that question 
until a later time during the consideration 
of the resolution; and, pending 
the question of adopting the ninth portion 
of the divided question, it shall be 
in order to move the previous question 
thereon, and if the previous question is 
ordered, to move that the House commit 
the resolution to a select committee, 
with or without instructions, and 
that the previous question be considered 
as ordered on the motion to commit 
to final adoption without intervening 
motion. 

The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentleman from 
Texas? 

Mr. BONIOR. Reserving the right to 
object, Mr. Speaker, under my reservation 
I would like to ask the gentleman 


H 10 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 1995 

from Texas [Mr. ARMEY] several questions 
about his unanimous-consent request. 


First of all, does the gentleman’s request 
allow us to offer an amendment 
to ban gifts by lobbyists? 

Mr. ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 

Mr. BONIOR. I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas. 

Mr. ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, I say to 
the gentleman, You are entitled under 
the rules to offer a germane amendment 
in your motion to commit if it is 
ruled by the Parliamentarian that such 
an amendment is germane. 

Mr. BONIOR. Further reserving the 
right to object, Mr. Speaker, I would 
propound to my distinguished friend 
from Texas another question: 

Is your request an open amendment 
process which allows Members the opportunity 
to offer germane amendments? 
We have the opportunity to 
offer germane amendments? 

Mr. ARMEY. If the gentleman would 
yield, I am advised by the gentleman 
from New York [Mr. SOLOMON], the 
chairman of the Committee on Rules, 
that the rule is more open than any we 
have ever had in the past. 

Mr. BONIOR. Is the gentleman saying 
that no amendments are in order 
under the request and this is a closed 
rule? 

Mr. ARMEY. If the gentleman would 
yield, there are plenty of amendments 
in order. 

Mr. BONIOR. Does this afford the minority 
a right to offer an amendment, 
I would ask the gentleman from Texas? 

Mr. ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman 
would yield, I am again advised 
by the gentleman from New York [Mr. 
SOLOMON], the chairman of the Committee 
on Rules, that my colleague can 
include any amendment he wants in 
the motion to commit so long as it 
meets the test of germaneness. 

Mr. BONIOR. Will we have time to 
debate the motion to commit? 

Mr. ARMEY. I believe under the rules 
of the House it is a nondebatable motion. 


Mr. BONIOR. So we can offer the motion 
and we cannot debate it? 

Mr. ARMEY. If the gentleman would 
yield, there will be about 31/2 hours of 
debate, and it is the judgment of this 
Member that there will be plenty of opportunity 
within that time since time 
will be allocated to the minority for 
debate purposes to make the points 
that the gentleman might want to 
make related to their motion to commit. 


b1430 

It is a common practice that we used 
many times when we were in the minority 
exercising our prerogative to 
make a motion to commit. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
understanding we will not be able to 
offer amendments on the motion the 
gentleman has put forward, and that 
we will not be able, for instance, to 
offer the amendment that we wish to 
offer on the gift ban. 

In fact, I would ask another question 
of my friend. Does this request envision 
a division of the open-amendment 
process for the Congressional Accountability 
Act to be considered at the end 
of the day? 

Mr. ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 

Mr. BONIOR. I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas. 

Mr. ARMEY. Perhaps at this point I 
might address the Speaker and express 
my wonderment as to whether or not 
the gentleman is going to make an objection. 


Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, reserving 
my right to object, let me just say that 
given that the gentleman has informed 
the House that he is requesting two 
completely closed rules, two gag rules, 
I might add, on the first day of the 
Congress, I object. 

The SPEAKER. An objection has 
been heard. 

The Chair now recognizes the distinguished 
gentleman from New York [Mr. 
SOLOMON]. 

Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, by direction 
of the House Republican Conference, 
since there is no Committee on 
Rules yet, and the Committee on Rules 
has not met yet to organize and will 
not until tomorrow, by direction of the 
Republican Conference, I call up a privileged 
resolution and ask for its immediate 
consideration. 

The SPEAKER. The Clerk will report 
the resolution. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. RES. 5 
Resolved, That upon the adoption of this 
resolution it shall be in order to consider in 
the House the resolution (H. Res. 6) adopting 
the Rules of the House of Representatives for 
the One Hundred Fourth Congress. The resolution 
shall be considered as read. The resolution 
shall be debatable initially for 30 minutes 
to be equally divided and controlled by 
the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader 
or their designees. The previous question 
shall be considered as ordered on the resolution 
to final adoption without intervening 
motion or demand for division of the question 
except as specified in sections 2 and 3 of 
this resolution. 
SEC. 2. The question of adopting the resolution 
shall be divided among nine parts, to 
wit: each of the eight sections of title I; and 
title II. Each portion of the divided question 
shall be debatable separately for 20 minutes, 
to be equally divided and controlled by the 
Majority Leader and the Minority Leader or 
their designees, and shall be disposed of in 
the order stated. 
SEC. 3. Pending the question of adopting 
the ninth portion of the divided question, it 
shall be in order to move that the House 
commit the resolution to a select committee, 
with or without instructions. The previous 
question shall be considered as ordered 
on the motion to commit to final adoption 
without intervening motion. 

The SPEAKER. The resolution is a 
matter of privilege. The gentleman 
from New York [Mr. SOLOMON] is recognized 
for 1 hour. 

Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purposes of debate only, I yield 30 minutes 
to the distinguished minority 
leader, or in this case the minority 

whip, or his designee, pending which I 
yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 

(Mr. SOLOMON asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks 
and to include extraneous material.) 


Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, the resolution 
before us is a special rule authorized 
by the Republican Conference 
providing for the consideration of a 
resolution adopting the rules of the 
House for the 104th Congress. 

While such a special rule is not unprecedented, 
I think the last time it 
was done was back in 1893. So this is an 
unusual situation. We have never before 
had an objection to the rules being 
brought up by unanimous consent. 

As returning Members are aware, ordinarily 
the resolution adopting House 
rules at the beginning of a Congress is 
considered as privileged in the House 
and subject to just 1 hour of debate, 
with no amendments, and on up-ordown 
vote following the vote on the 
previous question and any motion to 
commit the resolution. 

This special rule allows for a different 
and more expansive consideration 
of the House rules resolution. 

First, instead of just 1 hour of debate, 
which is customary in this House 
and traditional over the years, certainly 
all of the years I have been here, 
it provides for a total of 31/2 hours of 
debate, equally divided and controlled 
by the majority and the minority 
party. 

Second, instead of just one vote on 
adopting the resolution, the special 
rule allows for nine separate votes, not 
counting a vote on committing the resolution. 
I would again call this to the 
attention of the Members on that side 
of the aisle. It allows for nine separate 
votes, not counting a vote on committing 
the resolution, which I assume the 
minority would be offering. 

This time will be divided as follows: 

First, there will be 30 minutes of general 
debate on the resolution, equally 
divided between the majority and the 
minority. 

Second, there will follow 20 minutes 
of debate each on the eight sections 
contained in title I of the resolution, 
and that is the Contract with America: 
The Bill of Accountability Act. 

Mr. Speaker, each of these sections 
will be subject to a separate vote under 
an automatic division of the question. 

Third, there will be additional 20 
minutes of debate on title II of the resolution, 
containing an additional 23 
sections, followed by a separate vote on 
title II. That is nine votes altogether. 

It would be in order for the minority, 
prior to the final vote on adopting title 
II of this bill, to offer a motion to commit 
the resolution. 

However, I want to point out that 
this special rule does not allow for a 
separate previous question vote on 
title II. So if the minority wishes to 
have a previous question vote to alter 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H 11 

the terms of this procedure and make 
in order additional amendments, it 
must defeat the previous question on 
this special rule. They have that prerogative. 


We are allowing the minority its traditional 
previous question vote 
through this rule, but we are not being 
so generous as to allow the minority 
two previous question votes. We are 
going to be here until 10:30, 11:30, possibly 
even 2 o’clock in the morning, 
and we want to expedite this as quickly 
as possible. 

I would also point out in that same 
regard that the previous question is 
automatically ordered on the adoption 
of each of the eight sections in title I. 

That means that there will be no separate 
previous question votes on those 
sections, nor will there be an opportunity 
to commit any of those sections, 
with or without instructions. 

That does not mean, Mr. Speaker, 
that the minority will be precluded in 
its final motion to commit on title II 
from revisiting any matter that has 
been adopted in title I. They can still 
take that opportunity, if they wish. On 
the contrary, all of the rules of the 
House that have been adopted to that 
point are still subject to further 
amendment in any motion to commit, 
and any additional amendments to 
House rules will be in order as well. 

In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, we have 
designed in this procedure the fairest 
and most open process on a House rules 
resolution in over a century in this 
House. We have allowed over three 
times as much debate as is usual on 
opening day, and nine times as many 
votes. 

We will be giving Members on both 
sides of the aisle an opportunity to separately 
vote on each of the nine items 
contained in our Contract with America 
as embodied in title I. And the minority 
will retain its usual right to 
alter this procedure further if it defeats 
the previous question on this 
rule, and it will retain its usual right 
to commit the resolution with a final 
amendment at the conclusion of debate 
on title II. 

I therefore, Mr. Speaker, urge adoption 
of this special rule. 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time, perhaps for a colloquy with 
the minority whip. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

Mr. Speaker, last November, the 
American people voted for change. 

They sent a message to this House, a 
message of anger and frustration. 

We, in our party, have heard that 
message, the message of working families 
whose incomes are squeezed, working 
families who are tired of business 
as usual, who feel that no one speaks 
for them. 

In the days and weeks and months 
ahead, we, in the Democratic Party intend 
to be their voice. 

When tax cuts are proposed, we intend 
to make sure that it is working 

families who benefit, not the wealthiest 
few. 

In our efforts to balance the budget, 
we intend to make sure that our seniors 
are not robbed of their right to Social 
Security or Medicare, that our 
children are not deprived of their right 
to education and practical training for 
good jobs. 

And we intend to make sure that 
when we talk about reforming this 
House, those reforms are real, concrete, 
and that they make a difference. 
We have seen the symbols of change 
today. In what is the greatest tribute 
to, this, the world’s greatest democratic 
institution, the gavel has 
changed hands. Power has shifted. 

The Republican Party has promised 
an agenda of reform. We, Democrats intend 
to make sure they keep their 
promises. Today, we deal with the rules 
of this House. These issues may seem 
arcane, removed from the lives of average 
Americans. But what we do today 
sends a powerful signal. For today, we 
define the rules and standards that we, 
as Members of Congress, are determined 
to live by. 

Most Democrats will support most of 
the reforms that are being offered. 
Some of them were our own reforms, 
reforms that were blocked last year, in 
a cynical move for partisan advantage 
by the Republican Party. Some of them 
are of little consequence. Whether they 
pass or not makes little difference. 
But, none of these reforms go far 
enough. They stop short. They are just 
window dressing, hiding the real shift 
in power the Republicans intend to 
bring about. 

The American people voted for 
change last November. They did not 
vote to create a Congress that is for 
sale to the highest bidder. They voted 
for change. But they did not vote for a 
Congress where leaders take care of 
their own private profits before they 
take care of the public business. 

They voted for change. But they did 
not vote for a Congress that is beholden 
to multimillionaires. And they 
did not vote to allow Members of Congress 
to trade on the public trust, and 
become millionaires themselves. They 
did not vote for a Congress that is entangled 
with special interests or tied to 
the powerful concerns of foreign corporations. 


The American people did not vote to 
open the doors of Congress to the 
Power Rangers or the powers that be, 
but to the power of the average American. 
With this paltry package of reforms, 
the Republican Party has shown 
that they just don’t get the message. 

We are about to witness the biggest 
takeover by special interests in the 
history of the U.S. Congress, and this 
so-called reform package does nothing 
to stop it. This rules package is nothing 
more than a string of broken promises. 


After the years of whining and complaining 
on the Republican side about 
the damages to democracy of closed 
rules, what is the first thing they offer 

us? A closed rule. Not just one closed 
rule, but a closed rule within a closed 
rule. 

Where is democracy, where is open 
debate, where is the free flow of ideas? 
Not one amendment will be able to be 
offered to anything the Republicans do 
today. Not one amendment. 

This would not matter so much, if 
the Republicans had offered us real reform. 
But their package leaves out the 
single most important effort that could 
help stop the influence of special interests, 
a ban on gifts from lobbyists. 

Last year, the Republicans ran from 
reform, and blocked passage of the gift 
ban bill in the Senate. This year, they 
are going even further. With this closed 
rule, with this gag rule, they have prevented 
a gift ban from being offered as 
a separate amendment. 

We need to defeat the previous question 
on this gag rule, to provide an 
open rule that will allow us to get to 
the real issues of reform, including a 
ban on gifts from special interests. 

This is essentially the same gift ban 
provision that was passed overwhelmingly 
last year, Republicans claimed to 
be for it then, now that they are in 
control, it is time to get real about reform, 
and pass this ban on gifts. 

In recent weeks, it has become clear 
that there is a serious loophole in even 
this major reform. We have discovered 
that there are backdoors to getting 
gifts. And one of these back doors is 
through book deals, with lucrative advances 
and multimillion dollar royalty 
contracts. 

I will be urging my colleagues to defeat 
the previous question so that we 
can offer an open rule which will allow 
an amendment to directly address this 
issue of whether a Member of Congress 
should be allowed to earn millions of 
dollars in book royalties while employed 
at the taxpayers expense. 

We intend to try to offer an amendment 
that would cap royalties from 
any individual book to one-third of a 
Member’s annual salary. 

Let me make this very clear: by 
making this proposal today, we are not 
trying to discourage Members from 
writing books. Public officials all the 
way back to ancient Greece have written 
books, including many esteemed 
Members of this body. 

But at the same time, no Member 
should be able to use the prestige of 
this office to cut a special deal. 

No Member of Congress should be allowed 
to use this office—this public 
trust—for personal gain. No Member of 
Congress should make a book deal in 
one day that equals far more than the 
average American family earns in their 
entire lifetime. 

A one-third cap on royalties is reasonable. 
It is more than generous. The 
public expects us to do no less. 

We were not elected to this body to 
get rich; we’re here to do the people’s 
business and that is a full time job. 

It is important today that we send 
the word out across America that we 
are serious about reform, that this 


H 12 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 1995 

Congress is not for sale, our offices are today, 8 of them in the contract for been promised for consideration by the 
not open to the highest bidder. America, 23 in title II, all of which are leadership in the past. 

A vote for the previous question and additional reforms to the existing 1993 I believe very strongly that this rule 
for this gag rule is a vote to shut out Democrat rules package that is here. is going to allow us to have free, fair, 

real reform. It is a vote to fling open 
the doors to special interests. It is a 
vote to continue the old order. 

I urge my colleagues, especially 
those of you for whom this is your very 
first vote, those of you who ran on the 
promise of reform, do not side with the 
special interest. Let us open the door 
to real reform. Vote no on the previous 
question and let’s come back with a 
rule that will allow us to ban gifts 
from lobbyists and to limit the royalties 
of Members of Congress. 

This House of Representatives is not 
for sale. Say no to gifts. Say no to excessive 
book deals. Support an open 
rule. 

b1440 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, let me 
yield myself such time as I might 
consume just briefly. 

Mr. Speaker, I would just like to 
point out to my good friend, the gentleman 
from Michigan [Mr. BONIOR], 
and he is a good friend and I have deep 
respect for him, but I believe, DAVID, 
that you were a member of the task 
force on the ethics bipartisan task 
force that allowed Members to take 
book royalties from legitimate book 
firms back, what year was that, back 
in 1981 or 1982, I believe. 1989, it was 
even more recent. 

But let me just address this rule 
business, because when Speaker GINGRICH 
called me before him when we 
were going to talk about the formation 
of the new Committee on Rules, he instructed 
me, along with the other eight 
Republicans that will make up that 
committee to be as open and fair and 
accountable as we possibly can. As the 
gentleman knows, in recent years 
under the past two Speakers, we have 
gone to almost a totally structured 
rule process, where Members on both 
sides of the aisle have literally been 
gagged. The House was not allowed to 
work its will. 

The gentleman knows that conservative 
Democrats on your side of the 
aisle complained bitterly about it, people 
like the gentleman from Minnesota, 
Tim Penny, and the gentleman 
from Louisiana, BILL TAUZIN, and others, 
because they were not allowed to 
offer amendments on this floor. 

Speaker GINGRICH has asked me to be 
as open and fair as we possible can, and 
to reverse the fact that 70 percent of 
all of the rules that came to this floor 
last year were closed or structured or 
restricted rules. He has asked us to try 
to make an open rule process the norm, 
and not the exception. We are going to 
do that. I am going to follow his instructions. 
Now, at this point, let me 
yield to a Member who served on the 
Speaker’s task force to reform this 
House. I had the privilege of serving 
with him. We developed these kinds of 
reforms that we are offering here 

Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to a very distinguished 
member of the committee, the gentleman 
from California [Mr. DREIER]. 

(Mr. DREIER asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


b1450 

Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend, the 
gentleman from Glens Falls, the soon 
to be chairman of the Committee on 
Rules, for yielding me this time, Mr. 
Speaker. 

Let me just say that as I have listened 
to the words from my very dear 
friend, the gentleman from Mount 
Clemens, MI [Mr. BONIOR], who has described 
this as a closed rule, I have to 
say that it is absolutely preposterous 
to claim that what is clearly the most 
open rule on an opening day in recent 
congressional history is closed. Now, in 
the past we have regularly seen basically 
a single up-or-down vote, but as 
Speaker GINGRICH said in his remarks 
earlier, we are going to be today casting 
votes on eight different provisions, 
providing Members with the opportunity 
to look at virtually every aspect 
of the preamble of our contract with 
America. 

As I listen to the arguments about a 
closed rule here, I cannot help but 
think about the fact that nearly every 
single week during the second session 
of the 103d Congress I stood right there 
at that desk and asked the majority 
leader, the gentleman from Missouri 
[Mr. GEPHARDT], or his representative, 
the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. 
BONIOR], or the gentleman from Maryland 
[Mr. HOYER], or another Member 
when we could expect the congressional 
reform package to get to the House 
floor. 

Mr. Speaker, the response was regularly 
‘‘Well, we are hoping that we will 
be able to get it up first in early spring 
of 1994.’’ Then it was late spring, then 
early summer, then midsummer then 
before we adjourned for August, and 
then after August it was before we adjourned. 
As we all know very well, at 
the end of the 103d Congress, we got a 
little speck and nothing more than 
that when we passed this rule calling 
for congressional compliance. 

It seems to me that as we look at 
this issue, this issue is a very important 
one which we have struggled to 
get our friends who were formerly in 
the majority to bring to the House 
floor, and because of their recalcitrance 
on the issue of congressional 
reform over the past 2 years, we are on 
the opening day bringing these reforms 
as expeditiously as we possibly can. 
Why? Because we have debated these 
throughout virtually every campaign. 
On every measure that dealt with the 
issue of congressional reform, I attempted 
to defeat the previous question, 
to make in order our congressional 
reform package, which again had 

and open debate on this extraordinarily 
important issue, on this extraordinarily 
important day. I say we have 
got to get the job of congressional reform 
completed and completed today, 
so that we can do what the American 
people are anticipating from us in the 
next 100 days. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21/2 
minutes to the distinguished gentleman 
from Texas [Mr. BRYANT]. 

(Mr. BRYANT of Texas asked and 
was given permission to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 

Mr. BRYANT of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I would say to the gentleman from 
California, [Mr. DREIER], he also stood 
at that desk over there every single 
day and he condemned closed rules as 
being a violation of the democratic 
process, and he promised that if he 
were in charge we would never again 
see closed rules. 

And where are we today? The first 
day of the first session of Congress, 
when you are finally in charge, and the 
very first rule you bring to the House 
is a closed rule. Now I would just have 
to say to the gentlemen from California 
and New York, Mr. DREIER and Mr. 
SOLOMON, it is a curious thing to see on 
the first day of the House these two 
gentlemen, who took up so much of our 
time talking about closed rules, to be 
the authors of a closed rule on the first 
day of this Congress. 

It is indeed also curious that, after so 
much talk about reform, that they 
would bring to the House floor today a 
set of rules that excludes any reference 
to reform of the process we have today 
under which lobbyists are permitted to 
buy gifts, meals, and thinly disguised 
vacation trips for Members of Congress. 


I must say it is especially curious inasmuch 
as in October the Speaker of 
the House, Mr. GINGRICH, was on ‘‘Meet 
the Press’’ saying, and I quote, ‘‘I am 
prepared to pass a bill that bans lobbyists 
from dealing with Members of Congress 
in terms of gifts.’’ 

Yet here we are on the first day, the 
first opportunity to do it, and not only 
is it not a part of the Republican package, 
we are prohibited from even offering 
an amendment to the Republican 
package to prohibit lobbyists from 
buying gifts, free meals, and thinly disguised 
vacations for Members of Congress. 


They will not allow us to offer that 
amendment for a very simple reason, 
because they know that it would pass 
overwhelmingly. 

The Speaker and his leadership allies 
fought tooth and nail last year to kill 
the ban on gifts from lobbyists. They 
tried to keep the bill from being considered 
in the House, and when that 
failed, they encouraged a Senate filibuster 
which succeeded in killing it, 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H 13 

even though twice it passed the House 
of Representatives overwhelmingly and 
with a bipartisan majority. They said 
they were against it because somehow 
or another it interfered with the grassroots 
lobbying. 

I have an amendment which we will 
bring up when this previous question is 
defeated, which says that gifts will no 
longer be permitted to be given to 
Members of Congress in the forms of 
meals, free trips, free costly golf vacations 
or anything else from members of 
the lobby, from the lobbyists. 

I urge the new Republican Members, 
today you will decide whether you are 
in lock-step with this new Republican 
majority and the Speaker, or you are 
committed to the public. If you are 
committed to the public, vote against 
the previous question. Let us do the 
public’s business today and prohibit 
lobbyists from giving gifts, free meals, 
free vacations, free golf trips, and all 
other manner of freebies to Members of 
the House of Representatives. 

Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

The gentleman from Texas mentioned 
lockstep. Yes, we Republicans 
are in lockstep. We are in lockstep 
with the message that was sent by the 
American people on November 8, and 
we are going to accomplish the things 
they asked us to do. 

That means shrinking the size of this 
Congress by one-third, eliminating 600 
jobs, and setting the example for what 
we will do when we take up the 100 
days Contract With America in which 
we will shrink Government and we will 
grow the private sector. That is what 
we are laying the groundwork here 
today for. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield 21/2 minutes to 
the very distinguished member from 
Sanibel, FL [Mr. GOSS], a member of 
the Committee on Rules. 

(Mr. GOSS asked and was given permission 
to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. GOSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
very distinguished chairman of the 
Committee on Rules, the gentleman 
from New York [Mr. SOLOMON], for 
yielding me this time. 

It is the 4th of January, but it seems 
like the 4th of July, to me. It is Independence 
Day. It is Independence Day 
in this House, as we begin to set ourselves 
free from the shackles of what 
America knows is the status quo, business 
as usual. 

I hardly need to remind my colleagues 
about the Dark Ages, when 
committee chairmen zealously perpetuated 
their turfs; when Members 
missed committee meetings because 
votes were taken by proxy; when committee 
meetings could be held in the 
dead of the night behind closed doors, 
sometimes locked closed doors, locked 
to the minority; when Members could 
come to this floor and apparently 
wilfully disclose classified information 
without admonition; when large tax 
bills could pass on the slimmest of 

margins and huge spending packages 
could slide through on a voice vote. 

The excesses of Congresses past are 
well documented. On November 8, 
Americans sent a message. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, message received. Limiting 
the terms of committee chairmen, banning 
proxy voting, establishing truth 
in budgeting, reducing staff, opening 
up and streamlining the committee 
process, mandating recorded votes on 
spending bills, these changes today will 
make this a more responsive and responsible 
House. By laying this groundwork 
for a new beginning, we take the 
first concrete steps toward earning 
back the trust of the people that we 
are here to serve. 

I am pleased that this rules package 
includes a simple but important requirement 
that Members wishing access 
to classified material sign an oath 
of secrecy, a powerful change that 
should increase Members’ awareness 
and accountability where national security 
is at stake. 

At the same time, we are taking 
major steps to bring sunshine into the 
daily workings of this House’s business 
and to ensure individual Members’ accountability 
for all of their actions. All 
around, this is a balanced of package of 
substantive change. 

It is not exclusive. There will be 
more, and I invite the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas [Mr. BRYANT] to 
join me in sponsoring my bill that bans 
lobbyist-paid travel, if he wants further 
reform. This is the beginning step. 

I urge all of my colleagues to join me 
in support of these new rules today. It 
is not the final thing, but it is the most 
important thing we are going to do, because 
it is going to show America we 
are serious about making the changes. 
Of course, there will be more oncoming. 
Today it is a good agenda. It is an 
American agenda, and it is today’s 
agenda, so let us pass it. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, for purposes 
of debate only, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from Texas [Ms. 
SHEILA JACKSON-LEE]. 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
am a proud new Member of the 104th 
Congress, and I want to speak just for 
a moment to my fellow new Members, 
because we all campaigned for reform. 
I urge you, do not get cold feet. 

I come armed with the Constitution 
of the United States of America that 
says ‘‘We, the people of the United 
States, in order to form a more perfect 
Union,’’ among other things, ‘‘secure 
the blessings of liberty to ourselves 
and our posterity,’’ not to Congress, 
not to individual congressional Members, 
but the people want for themselves 
the right to live and the right to 
know that their Congress is not owned 
and bought. 

b1500 

The American people want reform, 
not phony reform but real reform. 
They want to know that the ties of special 
interests are now really broken. 
They want to know that the days of 

free meals and free trips and special 
privileges are over. They are angry and 
we did hear their voices. We the Democratic 
Members heard their voices in 
November, and today we want to start 
fresh and anew talking about reform. 
But we need to go a lot further. If we 
want to send a real signal that we are 
really changing Washington, we need 
to ban gifts from lobbyists and special 
interests. As Members of Congress, we 
should not be using public office for 
private gain. We are here to make 
change, not to protect the old order. 
Let us begin by having an open debate. 
What is wrong with amendments allowing 
us to raise the voice of the American 
people? No more closed rules, no 
more status quo. Let the American 
people realize that we are not for sale. 

Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

I would just point out to the gentlewoman, 
I know she is a freshman Member, 
but in the last Congress, the 103d 
Congress, 70 percent of every rule that 
came to this floor under Speaker Foley 
was a restricted, closed, or modified 
rule. We are reversing that through 
your order, sir, and we will have open 
rules in this House. We will have openness, 
fairness, and accountability. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Georgia [Mr. LINDER], 
the very distinguished new member of 
the Committee on Rules. 

Mr. LINDER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 

I would like to point out that it is 
clear what the theme of the day is from 
your side and, that is, gifts from lobbyists 
and that is going to appeal not to 
the people in this body but to the people 
watching this on C–SPAN. 

It is worth noting that after 40 years 
of rule, including the last 2 when the 
Democrats had control of both the 
House and the Senate and also the 
White House, that this should have 
been able to have been passed. But this 
rule is not about gifts from lobbyists. 
That is a bill to come. This rule does 
not include amendments for campaign 
finance reform or parking at Washington 
National or indeed paid travel from 
lobbyists. This rule has to do with 
process, process of how Congress acts, 
the committees, the staffs, the way we 
budget. We will deal with those issues 
at a later date in separate bills. We 
have done that in the past. We have cooperated 
in trying to get campaign finance 
reform to the floor, in trying to 
get lobbying reform to this House, all 
in stand-alone, individual bills. Let us 
be honest about it. 

We understand your point of view in 
the minority, trying to distract Americans’ 
attention from the issue of the 
day, which is passing a rule by which 
we live for the next 2 years. This rule 
deals with process, how Congress conducts 
itself. Let us contain our comments 
to that point. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11/2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
[Mr. DOGGETT]. 


H 14 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 1995 

(Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, like our 
Republican colleagues as a new Member 
of this Congress, I came seeking 
constructive change, and of that 
change I was most eager to join with 
our Republican colleagues the concept 
of opening this House. 

Yet at this first opportunity for 
change, this Republican rules package 
fails. I do not know what they call a 
rule in California or New York where 
you get no amendment and no alternative, 
but in Texas we call that closed 
government. 

You propose two completely closed 
rules, two rules that do not allow one 
new Member, one old Member, one Republican, 
one Democrat to offer any 
amendment to this package. More than 
that, you have done what is unprecedented 
perhaps in the history of this 
country, and that is to provide a closed 
rule within a bill that is brought up 
under a closed rule. 

This is not open government. This is 
not reform. It is more closed government 
as usual. This is barring the door, 
slamming the door shut and actually 
then barring that door for people to 
participate in the process of democracy. 


It was only a few months ago that 
the distinguished gentleman from California 
[Mr. DREIER] suggested that 
when a closed rule is foisted on this 
House, the Members are denied the opportunity 
to represent their constituents. 
That is no less true today. 

You have said that this is a new 
chapter in the history of this House, 
but you have made it an edited, indeed 
a censored chapter. You have said you 
have changed the course of business in 
this House, but I would submit, to use 
the words of the distinguished gentleman 
from New York, that it is merely 
shortchange. 

Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
just to say to Members on that side of 
the aisle how refreshing it is now to see 
Members from the Democratic Party 
standing up and fighting for those minority 
rights that we fought for for 40 
years on this floor. We welcome you 
into this debate and we are going to 
open up this House today. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
distinguished gentleman from Ohio 
[Mr. REGULA], one of the senior Members 
of this House. 

(Mr. REGULA asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, today is 
truly a momentous occasion. After 
serving in the minority for 11 terms, 
new and historic horizons are being 
opened as Republicans become the majority 
party in the House of Representatives 
for the first time in 40 years. 

We are beginning the first day of the 
104th Congress with a full schedule of 
much-needed internal reforms in the 
House of Representatives. We will vote 

on eight separate reforms including a 
reduction of committee staff by one-
third, requiring that committee meetings 
be open to the public and requiring 
that members of committees be 
present for votes in their committees. 

This new openness in the committee 
process is important because it is the 
first step in establishing the accountability 
that the American people are 
demanding of the Congress. The most 
important decisions on legislation are 
often made during committee deliberations. 
Members of committees become 
experts in the areas of the committee’s 
jurisdiction and other Members rely on 
their judgment. 

One of the most important reforms 
we are voting on today is the ban of 
proxy voting in committees. Proxy voting 
allows another Member to cast a 
vote on legislation for a Member who is 
absent. Of the 22 standing committees 
in the last Congress, only 4 banned absentee 
voting. I am a member of the 
Appropriations Committee which has 
never allowed the use of proxy voting. 
All Members should be present to vote 
on issues before the committee. 

Accountability to the American public 
begins in the committee system by 
Members being present for meetings 
and votes, and those meetings being 
open to the public. We must assure all 
of our constituents of the seriousness 
with which we approach our work of 
deliberating the issues of importance 
to our country. Only then can the integrity 
of the Congress be reestablished. 


Today’s action can be defined in five 
words: ‘‘Accountability in the People’s 
House.’’ 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, for purposes 
of debate only, I yield 1 minute 
to the distinguished gentlewoman from 
Connecticut [Ms. DELAURO]. 

Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
voice my opposition to the closed rule 
on the Republican rules package. This 
package contains many important reforms 
that I support, but it does not 
contain the most crucial reform, a ban 
on gifts from lobbyists. The gift ban is 
central to our ability to break the bond 
between the special interests and the 
Congress. That is what the public 
clamored for, separate special interests 
from the institution of the Congress. 

The Democratic proposal would ban 
all gifts to Members of Congress. It 
bans meals, entertainment, and travel. 
It says no more business as usual. 

On this first day of the 104th Congress 
when so many hopes are pinned 
on people reclaiming their Government, 
it is tie to end the special interests’ 
influence over Congress. It is time 
to say no. No to dinners, no to golf junkets, 
no to the old style perks and 
privileges. The only privilege we need 
is the privilege to serve in this body. 

The new Republican majority claims 
that they are leading a revolution to 
reform this institution. That is what 
they told the American public. But 
keeping closed rules, protecting perks 
and privileges is just more hypocrisy. 

Support real change. Open the rule 
and support a gift ban. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, for purposes 
of debate only, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. 
DURBIN]. 

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. Speaker, there is a 
reason why the Republicans oppose the 
Democratic rules change in this closed 
rule. Our rules change makes every 
rules change proposed by the Republicans 
today pale in comparison. Theirs 
are plastic and papier mache. Ours 
have the hard steel of real change because 
they address the key issue of the 
integrity of Congress. 

Today as we speak on this floor with 
a few Members, so many others are enjoying 
this wonderful first day of service 
in Congress. They came here promising 
to represent their districts, not 
the special interests. Our rules change 
addresses that straightforwardly. It 
prohibits and limits any gifts from lobbyists 
and special interest groups so 
that new Members and old Members 
alike will not be ensnared in these special 
interest tangles. And equally important, 
Mr. Speaker, it closes or at 
least restricts a dangerous loophole. 

By the rules of the House I cannot go 
out and give a speech and earn one dollar. 
But I can go out, and in the name 
of writing a book, supposedly earn legally 
millions of dollars. That kind of 
ridiculous loophole puts this House in 
jeopardy and every Member of it. 

I would suggest that we stick with 
the Democratic changes and defeat the 
previous question. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to yield 1 minute to a very distinguished 
new Member, the gentleman 
from South Carolina [Mr. GRAHAM]. 

(Mr. GRAHAM asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I came 
from South Carolina, a State that a 
few years ago sent about 18 people to 
jail because they took shirts, they took 
shoes, they took golf trips, and they 
sold their vote. If Members want to reform 
me, I challenge them to do so. 
But everything in its time. For 40 
years Democrats have had control of 
this body to do that. 

What the American people need to 
know, and what I want constituents to 
know at home is what we are talking 
about doing the first day is to change 
the way this institution operates. 
NEWT GINGRICH, the new Speaker of the 
House, has done something that no 
Speaker of the House has ever done in 
this body, Republican or Democrat. He 
has instituted a measure to limit his 
own term as Speaker. I congratulate 
him for doing that. Leadership and reform 
begins at the top, and that is 
what he has demonstrated, and on behalf 
of the freshman class we thank 
him for doing something other than 
talk. 

Also in this rule is a provision that 
would limit committee chairmen to 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H 15 

serve 6 years. If we want to change 
America, that is a great place to start, 
and that is what we are talking about 
today, changing this institution to 
breathe new life into it. 

Mr. Speaker, ideas do matter, and 
they are going to have a new day. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, for purposes 
of debate only, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from New York [Mr. 
LAFALCE]. 

Mr. LAFALCE. Mr. Speaker, approximately 
1 hour ago you addressed every 
Member of this body and the House, 
you addressed the entire United States 
of America and you said this is the 
104th Congress. Think of it, 208 years. 
For 208 years, Mr. Speaker, we have existed 
under the rule of the majority. 

Two hundred eight years ago, Mr. 
Speaker, as a student of history you 
know that the Constitutional Convention 
adopted the Constitution rejecting 
the Articles of Confederation that have 
a super majority requirement. By a 
rules change, with no committee hearings, 
with only 20 minutes of debate, 
you want to strike a blow at the most 
fundamental tenet of constitutional 
principle: rule of the majority, and revert 
to the Articles of Confederation. 

Mr. Speaker, how can you do this on 
the first day of your tenure in office? 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to my friend, the gentleman 
from Cleveland, OH [Mr. HOKE]. 

Mr. HOKE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding me the time. 

Mr. Speaker, it is hard not to be 
somewhat amused by the shenanigans 
that are going on on the floor right 
now when we are being told that we are 
completely shackling the rights of the 
minority by not allowing them to have 
the central reform that should be in 
this rules package; that is, the gift and 
lobby reform. 

It has to be pointed out that for 40 
years Democrats have had the opportunity 
to pass this fundamental gift 
and lobby reform, and yet they have 
not been able to do it in a timely way 
that got through both the House and 
the Senate and was signed into law. 
For them now to claim that somehow, 
somehow this is preventing them from 
doing this when they know substantively 
we will get to this later, the 
question I have is why did they choose 
the gift and lobby reform as opposed to 
fundamental campaign finance reform, 
that is the elimination of special interest 
contributions, They know and I 
know that about $250,000 plus goes into 
every single incumbent’s campaign on 
a cyclical basis. That is real influence 
that is being purchased by special interest 
groups, and yet there is only one 
group, one group in the entire Congress, 
not the House Republicans, not 
the Senate Democrats, not the Senate 
Republicans that do not want to limit 
that genuine purchasing of influence, 
and that group is the House Democrats. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

Mr. Speaker, let me refresh my friend 
from Cleveland’s memory. We did pass 

the gift rule ban last Congress and it 
was killed in the other body by the Republican 
Party. 

I also would like to refresh my 
friend’s memory and suggest to him 
that we did pass campaign finance reform 
and it was killed also by Republicans. 


Mr. HOKE. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman 
yield? 

Mr. BONIOR. I will not yield at this 
point. I would yield in a second to my 
friend using his time. 

So we have complied with the wishes 
of the American people on two basic, 
fundamental reforms which is banning 
gifts and reducing the influence of outside 
interests in campaign reform. We 
passed them in this House not very 
long ago, a few months ago, sent them 
over to the Senate and they were killed 
by Republicans. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield 11/2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
[Mrs. CLAYTON]. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
seconds to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina [Mrs. CLAYTON]. 

Mrs. CLAYTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of congressional reform and 
in support of several parts of the proposed 
rules package. No Member in this 
Chamber has a premium on what’s best 
for this Nation. We all have a contract 
with America. 

The contract to which each Member 
is bound, is to work in the best interests 
of the American people. 

On election day, we offered our services 
to this great country, and voters 
from Rocky Mount, NC, to the Silicone 
Valley of California, accepted our offer. 
We all have a contract with America. 

That contract involves being open to 
the challenge of change. I will vote for 
several of the reforms offered in this 
rules package. However, I will vote 
against those proposals that are considered 
dangerous to the stability of 
the American people or undermine the 
Constitution of this country. 

We must get beyond partisan politics 
and move to the high ground of principle—
serving all Americans. 

But, real reform must include an end 
to gag rules. There are important 
amendments that would be offered, 
amendments designed to improve and 
perfect this rules package, but Members 
are muzzled because the majority 
has insisted on a closed rule for this debate. 


No Member can offer an amendment 
such as the gift ban. That is an issue 
that we debated and supported last 
Congress. As I am informed, the gift 
ban we passed would have included royalties 
from books. If we are to be leaders, 
we must also lead in following the 
rules under which we are governed. In 
this House, we have resolved that no 
Member should be enriched beyond 
what the people pay. That resolve 
should not end with the Speaker, it 
should begin with him. 

I will support those thoughtful reforms 
that have been offered by the 
majority. But, I will continue to stand 

up as part of the loyal opposition when 
I believe pomposity, audacity and duplicity 
confront us. 

No party or person has an exclusive 
on such things as family values and 
personal responsibility. Those are 
standards I absolutely hold dear. And 
no party or person should be able to 
take the right to speak and participate 
from any of us. Too many have sacrificed 
for that precious liberty. We all, 
435 Representatives, have a contract 
with America. Let no one forget. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, as we continue 
with this freest and most open 
debate in congressional history, I yield 
2 minutes to my friend, the gentleman 
from Greensboro, NC [Mr. COBLE]. 

b1520 

Mr. COBLE. I thank the gentleman 
from Claremont, CA, for having yielded 
me this time. 

Reform the House? We Republicans 
have previously engaged in this exercise 
of attempting to reduce the number 
of staff positions and the number of 
committees. So this is not a case of 
first impression. 

But each time we proposed these reductions, 
they fell upon deaf ears, and 
the Democrat leadership rejected our 
attempts to streamline the Congress, 
and in so doing serve as better stewards 
for taxpayers. 

During this session, pending passage 
of this proposal today, there will be 25 
fewer subcommittees, 3 fewer standing 
committees. This will save taxpayers 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

I am advised that we have eliminated 
80 positions on one committee alone. I 
am not uncaring nor insensitive about 
this result, but these positions should 
never have been created in the first 
place. In applying retroactive psychology, 
Mr. Speaker, if our Democrat 
leadership friends had accepted our 
previous proposals which would have 
saved taxpayers millions of dollars, we 
Republicans may not be in the majority 
today. 

But in this town, pride of authorship 
is jealously guarded, and many people 
are reluctant to permit any good 
change unless they can claim the credit 
therefor. 

Today we Republicans again are offering 
proposals of change which we 
have previously attempted to no avail. 
On this day, Mr. Speaker, we will, indeed, 
prevail. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from New Mexico [Mr. RICHARDSON]. 

Mr. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, the 
American people sent us a message in 
November. They want less government, 
less bureaucracy, more ethics, and 
more accountability. They did not vote 
for arrogant government, and they did 
not vote for coronations of any one 
party or individual. 

This rule is a gag rule, no amendments 
to the Republican rules package. 
While the Speaker’s first statement 
was gracious, the first act of this new 
Republican majority is not about re



H 16 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 1995 

form. It is about congressional retreat. 
For all of their talk about reforming 
the old guard, Republicans today are 
doing something that probably no 
other Congress in history has ever 
done. They have proposed a closed rule 
within a bill brought up under a closed 
rule. 

Mr. Speaker, let us have openness 
and accountability. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, as we continue 
with the most open and free debate 
in the history of congressional 
history on any opening day, I yield 2 
minutes to my very good friend, the 
gentleman from Glenwood Springs, CO 
[Mr. MCINNIS], a new member of the 
Committee on Rules. 

Mr. MCINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from California for 
yielding me this time. 

Mr. Speaker, you know, we are talking 
about today new management versus 
old management, and it is often 
tough for old management to get used 
to the new management ideas. So what 
you have to do on the old management 
side of the aisle, you have to take a 
look and say, ‘‘How are we going to debate 
these rascals over there that want 
new management, that want accountability 
to the American people? How 
can we explain the fact we have allowed 
ghost voting, that we have had 
poor management for 40 years, allowed 
misleading budget information, allowed 
mostly closed rules, 70 percent 
last year? How can we explain to the 
American people there is no sunshine 
law in Congress? How can we explain 
these things so those rascals under the 
new management do not disclose the 
problems the American people recognized 
this last November?’’ The way 
you do it is you bring in distraction. 
You do not talk about the positive elements 
of this rule, which are manyfold, 
elimination of committee staff, no 
more ghost voting, no more false budget 
numbers. You have got to bring in 
distraction. 

So let us talk about gifts. I guess if it 
was your rule change maybe we ought 
to talk about inherited money and see 
if we have the same kind of merits. 

Do not distract us. Work for improvement. 
Work for progress. Join the new 
management. 

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 

The SPEAKER. There are to be no 
demonstrations in the gallery. Those in 
the gallery are here as guests of the 
House. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Florida 
[Mr. PETERSON]. 

Mr. PETERSON of Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding me this time. 

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
this closed rule. 

I agree with many of the reforms, but 
there are many, many opportunities 
for us to perfect this package. We are 
passing up an opportunity to close forever 
the huge ethical loophole in congressional 
activities, the potential for 
compromise by special interests. We 

can do so by banning gifts and by restricting 
the benefits from lobbyists 
and by restricting the benefits one can 
receive from our writings as we do now 
from our speeches. 

The American people sent us a message 
in November. They said they 
wanted personal accountability. They 
certainly do not wish for us to enrich 
ourselves as we serve them. 

Let us seize this opportunity to clean 
up this huge ethical loophole and truly 
reform congressional activities on this 
first open day of the debate of the 104th 
Congress. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from California [Mr. MILLER]. 

Mr. MILLER of California. Mr. 
Speaker, Members of the House, as a 
Member of this House on the Democratic 
side of the aisle who for 20 years 
never brought a bill to the floor under 
a closed rule, I am sure that I speak 
with credibility that this change is 
supposed to be about opening up this 
debate, and in fact that has not happened. 


The test is not whether this is more 
open than what we did on opening day. 
The test is whether or not this rule is 
open or closed, and this rule is, in fact, 
closed. 

What is your fear of having an open 
rule on congressional reform? That we 
would overreform the House of Representatives? 
Hard to conceived of 
that. What is your fear of having an 
open rule when you in fact have the 
votes to beat down any amendment 
that you do not like? What is your fear, 
that we would overreform? I do not 
think so. 

Your fear is we would offer what is 
not in here. The point is this: It is what 
you do not put in these rules that disturbs 
us and disturbs the American 
public, and that is breaking the link 
between lawyers, lobbyists, money, and 
legislators, ending the gifts that can be 
given to legislators and recognizing 
when the freshman Members took the 
oath here today, they were given a voting 
card, not a right to receive gifts to 
NFL games, to lunches and to dinners. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, as we continue 
with debate on the most open, 
open reform package that has come to 
this floor on an opening day, I yield 30 
seconds to a very hard-working member 
of the Joint Committee on the Organization 
of Congress, my friend and 
classmate, the gentleman from Cape 
Girardeau, MO [Mr. EMERSON]. 

(Mr. EMERSON asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. EMERSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me this 
time. 

You know, I have been somewhat 
amused sitting here listening to our 
colleagues on the minority side talking 
about open rules. I hope members of 
the American public know that we are 
in the process of reforming the Rules of 
the House of Representatives here 
today, that are going to bring a higher 

level of reform to this body than it has 
experienced in generations. 

I am amused by some of the rhetoric 
here and chagrined really at what I 
consider to be the nitpicking. It ill 
serves you, I think, to be so petty in 
your quibbling when we are bringing 
about major reform to this body. 

Mr. BONIOR. Well, with all due respect 
to my friend—and he is my 
friend—the gentleman from Missouri, 
breaking the ban and the link between 
lobbyists and lawyers and the power in 
this town in this institution we do not 
consider as petty. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from West Virginia [Mr. 
WISE]. 

Mr. WISE. Mr. Speaker, if the debate 
is free, and truly free, then why cannot 
we offer significant amendments for reform? 


Here is a list of what we can vote for; 
there is not a list of what we cannot 
vote for, because you will not permit 
us to offer certain amendments, and I 
offer this observation. 

But today there is no longer an opportunity 
for Members to fully participate 
in offering amendments to reform 
the House as it should be reformed. 
Students of history should note BOB 
WISE did not say this, the distinguished 
chairman of the Committee on Rules, 
the gentleman from New York [Mr. 
SOLOMON] said that on opening day of 
1991. 

Why is it that those who say they 
want change—and we all want change— 
will not permit us to bring to this floor 
a ban on gifts from lobbyists, a ban on 
dinners from lobbyists? Is this something 
radical? It has passed the House 
twice before. Why can we not bring to 
the floor the amendment to limit royalties 
and address another area of concern 
to the House? If you want change, 
then you have to vote for it. If you 
want change, then you have to work 
for it. If you want change, then you 
have to let true change flourish, and 
you have to let us offer these amendments. 


This is not true change, this is not 
reform that you are doing. You said 
you wanted open rules; make them 
open. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, as we continue 
debate under the most open process 
in congressional history, I yield 11/2 
minutes to my friend, the gentleman 
from Roanoke, VA [Mr. GOODLATTE]. 

Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 

Mr. Speaker, this is a new day in the 
people’s House, and a new day calls for 
new rules, and we are going to deliver 
those today. 

Let me say to our friends on the 
other side of the aisle who are claiming 
our reforms today do not go far 
enough, for 40 years you ran this place 
behind closed doors, keeping every 
perk, privilege, and partisan advantage. 
Now, suddenly, you are trying to 
tell the American people you have now 
become reformers. Well, I realize everyone 
should have ambitious New 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H 17 

Year’s resolutions, but this one is just 
too hard to swallow. Today, despite the 
resistance from the minority party, we 
are going to bring more reform to the 
House in 12 hours than the other party 
brought in 40 years of iron-fisted rule. 

We are wiping out three full standing 
committees and over 20 subcommittees; 
we are slashing bloated committee 
staffs, imposing term limits on the 
Speaker and committee chairmen and 
eliminating proxy voting. 

Finally, we are going to start making 
Congress live by the laws that American 
businesses and families live by. I 
think I can speak for many Americans 
when I say it is about time. 

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 

The SPEAKER. The gallery will not 
participate in the proceedings of the 
House. The gallery may watch as 
guests of the House. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that the gentleman 
who just spoke could not join 
us today, as he was one who in fact did 
vote on the gift ban in the last Congress 
when the issue was before us. I 
am sorry he did not join us today, when 
this party in fact has real power but I 
guess that is not in the cards. 

Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate 
only, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Pennsylvania 
[Mr. MASCARA]. 

Mr. MASCARA. I thank the gentleman 
from Michigan for yielding to 
me. 

Mr. Speaker, I too am proud to be a 
Member of the 104th Congress. Like 
many of my new colleagues, I campaigned 
on the issue of reform. I want 
to urge other Members to not get cold 
feet now. 

Our task today is very simple: It is to 
prove to the American people that we 
care more about the public interest 
than we do about the special interests; 
it is to provide that Congress is not for 
sale. 

Mr. Speaker, we are not royalty and, 
therefore, we do not need gifts. We do 
not need free trips or free meals or special 
privileges. We are stewards of the 
public trust. Our constituents elected 
us to work hard, to make tough decisions, 
and to stand up for what is right. 

As Members of Congress, we represent 
the public interest, not private 
profits. 

We are here to make change, not to 
protect the old order. Let us begin by 
having a open debate about the real 
needs of our constituents. No more 
closed rules, no more status quo. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, as we proceed 
with the most open debate in congressional 
history, I would like to yield 
1 minute to my friend, the gentleman 
from Ocala, FL [Mr. STEARNS]. 

Mr. STEARNS. I thank the gentleman. 


Good afternoon, Mr. Speaker—it is a 
wonderful afternoon. 

I thank my colleague from California. 


My colleague from Florida on the 
other side of the aisle talked about 
seizing the opportunity. He agrees with 
a lot of the reforms that we are going 
to present here shortly, but he is complaining 
about the parliamentary procedure. 
So I say to him why did he not, 
he and his party, bring all of these forward 
during the last 40 years? Let us 
take this opportunity to look at one of 
these, the Congressional Accountability 
Act, that we are going to pass here 
on opening day. 

What we are saying is that it will not 
be business as usual around here, and 
we intend to make Congress operate in 
a more fair and open manner. 

Thomas Jefferson said, ‘‘When a man 
assumes public trust, he should consider 
himself as public property.’’ By 
enacting this new set of rules for the 
House, we are stating unequivocally we 
believe in practicing what we preach. 

We must continue providing the bold 
and decisive leadership that brought us 
to this moment here in history. 

I urge my colleague from Florida who 
talked about seizing the opportunity: 
Let us move forward. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
just to answer my friend the gentleman 
from Florida [Mr. STEARNS]. He raised 
the issue why did we not do this before? 
In fact, we did the very reform 
that the gentleman from Florida spoke 
about, and that was congressional accountability. 


We authored the legislation, we 
passed it in this body. It was killed by 
the Republicans in the other body. We 
cane back, incorporated it in a rule 
which was governable for the rest of 
the session. 

So, to suggest to this Chamber and to 
the folks who are listening that we did 
not do that is just not the case. 

Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate 
only, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from California [Mr. BECERRA]. 

(Mr. BECERRA asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker and 
Members, I do not think this is a debate 
about whether this is the most 
open of open rules or closed rules in the 
history of this Congress, because it is a 
completely closed rule. 

If I had in my hand today an amendment 
to try to preserve for us the right 
to ban the gifts from lobbyists, I would 
not be able to do that right now. So let 
me quote to you some words that I 
think are most eloquently stated, back 
in May 25, 1993, ‘‘With closed rules, 
voices all across America are silenced. 
Republicans want the people to have 
choices, and that can only be done by 
having open rules.’’ Those very eloquent 
words were uttered by our new 
Speaker, Mr. NEWT GINGRICH. 

I would urge all of my colleagues in 
this House to recognize the words uttered 
by our new Speaker, that we 
should have open rules. This is a closed 
rule, it is not a good way to start this 
first year of this new Congress. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, as we continue 
with the most open debate in 
congressional history on opening day, I 
yield 11/2 minutes to the chairman 
emeritus of the Committee on Rules, 
my friend the gentleman from Kings-
port, TN [Mr. QUILLEN]. 

(Mr. QUILLEN asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me this 
time. I have been a member of the 
House for 32 years and a member of the 
Rules Committee for 30 of those years, 
always in the minority until now. I 
have probably spoken out on the House 
floor against closed rules more times 
than any other Member of this body. 

But even as a member of the minority, 
I have always believed that there 
were certain issues such as this that 
should be decided under a restricted or 
closed rule. To the best of my recollection, 
the resolutions establishing the 
rules of the House have been considered 
under a completely closed rule—with a 
straight up or down vote. This rule will 
allow Members the opportunity to vote 
on nine separate portions of the rules 
package. This is certainly a much more 
open process than any that I have seen 
in my 32 years. 

I think the minority should appreciate 
that the Republican majority 
chose to open up consideration of this 
rules package instead of following the 
traditional closed process that the 
Democrats embraced and promoted 
when they controlled the House. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, I have one 
speaker remaining. 

b1540 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Omaha, 
NE [Mr. CHRISTENSEN], a new Member 
who has joined us. 

(Mr. CHRISTENSEN asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 

Mr. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, as 
a new Member of the Republican majority, 
I look forward to working with 
my colleagues in the Democrat Party 
to make sure that these reforms come 
to place, but we have to remember that 
the American people sent us to do 
change. They sent us here to send a 
message and to make sure that the 
opening day activities included in the 
Contract With America were enacted, 
and that is making Congress live under 
the same laws that the rest of the 
American people have to live under. 
That is cutting one out of every three 
congressional staffers, and that is looking 
at an audit and getting that started. 


What I ask is: ‘‘Let’s get to the business 
the American people sent us here 
to do, and that’s the Contract With 
America.’’ 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Miami, 
FL [Mr. DIAZ-BALART], a new member 
of the Committee on Rules. 


H 18 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 1995 

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I 
admit that there are great parliamentary 
debaters on the other side of the 
aisle. Accordingly, I submit that they 
must do much better than this, to divert 
the attention of the American people 
from what we are doing today. 
What we are doing today is requiring 
all laws that apply to the rest of the 
country to apply to Congress. We are 
cutting the number of committee staff 
by a third. We are limiting the terms of 
committee chairs and subcommittee 
chairmanships to 6 years. We are banning 
the scandalous practice, scandalous 
practice, called proxy voting where 
Members did not have to go to a committee, 
and then the chairman, even if 
they did not have anybody there, did 
not have any of the Democrats there, 
they would ultimately win because he 
had the proxies of all the Members 
here, truly scandalous, profoundly undemocratic, 
conduct. That is what we 
are banning today. That is what we are 
doing in these rules. 

And what the Democrats now are 
saying is, ‘‘Ah.’’ They are using the 
parliamentary tactic of there is the 
Christmas gift for all children in the 
world is missing from this rules package. 
It is not going to work. That is not 
going to divert the attention of the 
American people from what we are 
doing today, and they are going to 
know what we are doing, they deserve 
what we are doing, and we are going to 
do it today. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
balance of my time to the distinguished 
minority leader, the gentleman 
from Missouri [Mr. GEPHARDT]. 

The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Missouri [Mr. GEPHARDT] is recognized 
for 41/4 minutes. 

(Mr. GEPHARDT asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 

Mr. GEPHARDT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to urge every Member of the House to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and 
‘‘yes’’ on the motion to commit. 

The Republican leadership would 
have us believe that they can pass 
eight or nine bills in a flurry of legislative 
accomplishment and debate. 

In fact, there can be no debate; there 
can be no discussion; there can be no 
effort to amend, or strengthen, or truly 
consider any of their proposals. 

This is what we call a closed rule. 
That means that unless you support 
every dot and comma in the Republican 
agenda, it is a closed discussion. 
And as far as serious public policy is 
concerned, it is a closed door. 

That is a tragedy, because the American 
people deserve more than rubber-
stamp Republicanism. 

That is why we must reject this rule, 
and open the crucial issue of congressional 
reform to discussion and improvement. 


The fact is, Democrats do not want 
to defeat this rules package. We want 
real reform. That is why many of the 
proposals being made today—such as 
making Congress abide by the laws it 
writes—have already been passed by 

the House. And that is why Democrats 
fought for even tougher reforms, such 
as a bill to curb the influence of lobbyists, 
which the Republicans defeated. 

The Republican reforms are all well 
and good—but they simply do not go 
far enough. They are a handful of procedural 
and administrative changes 
here in the House. Many of them are 
positive. Many of them deserve wide, 
bipartisan support—and they will have 
it. 

But they do not touch the real problem: 
the rampant hand of special interests 
here on Capitol Hill. 

If the Republicans were serious about 
attacking special interests, why would 
they fight the Democratic proposal to 
ban gifts from lobbyists? 

Do we want to go along and get 
along, by rubber-stamping this closed 
rule? Or do we want to rein in the special 
interests by defeating the rule, and 
having a real debate about reform? 

I urge the latter course. But at the 
same time, we must all recognize a 
broader point. 

All of this Republican talk of reform—
as necessary as it may be, and as 
productive as it may be—is ultimately 
a distraction from the real job at hand. 

Improving the lives of the hard-working, 
middle-class families who have 
seen their incomes erode, and their 
standard of living slide, for 15 painful 
years. 

No one should pretend that these 
narrow procedural changes will do anything 
to raise incomes, to restore economic 
security, to revive hope and 
faith in America’s future. 

And for that matter, no one should 
pretend that the Contract With America, 
with its huge tax cuts for the 
wealthy, and inevitable explosion of 
the Federal deficit—will improve people’s 
lives, either. 

Come back to my district in St. 
Louis. Meet some of the families where 
the husband works during the day, the 
wife works at night, and they barely 
ever see each other. Meet some of the 
families that have given up every 
minute of family time working two, 
three, even four jobs—and still cannot 
make ends meet. 

Then ask yourself whether some new 
procedural change can make a difference 
in their lives. 

My colleagues, I urge you to vote 
‘‘no’’ on the previous question, and 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the motion to commit, 
so we can have serious congressional 
reform. And then let us get down to the 
real business of the people. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 

The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
California [Mr. DREIER] is recognized 
for 1 minute. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, let me say 
with all due respect to my colleagues 
that I have never heard such preposterous 
arguments in my entire 14 years 
as a Member of this House, and let me 
say that this clearly is the most open 
debate that we have ever experienced 
on opening day in the history of the 

U.S. Congress. It is exactly what 
Speaker GINGRICH has called for, and it 
is exactly what we are creating. 

Now, over the past 2 years I had the 
privilege, mostly during calendar year 
1993, to work with my friends, the gentleman 
from New York [Mr. SOLOMON], 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. 
WALKER], the gentleman from Missouri 
[Mr. EMERSON], the gentleman from 
Colorado [Mr. ALLARD], the gentlewoman 
from Washington [Ms. DUNN] as 
Republican members of the Joint Committee 
on the Organization of Congress. 
We were charged with dealing 
with major reform in this institution. 
Reform in this institution is going to 
help working Americans because we 
are, by nearly 25 percent, reducing the 
number of committees in this place so 
we do not have 109 committees and subcommittees 
with jurisdiction over the 
Pentagon, 52 subcommittees and full 
committees with jurisdiction over programs 
dealing with children and families, 
and 92 subcommittees and committees 
dealing with the Environmental 
Protection Agency. We are creating 
an institution that is more accountable. 


Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the majority 
in years past has prevented us 
from having the opportunity to even 
consider those things. On this opening 
day we are doing it. We are doing it 
under the most open process in the history 
of this institution, and I thank my 
friends for joining with us. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time, and I move the previous 
question on the resolution. 

The SPEAKER. The question is on 
ordering the previous question. 

The question was taken; and the 
Speaker announced that the ayes appeared 
to have it. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 

The yeas and nays were ordered. 

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 

The SPEAKER. The Chair wishes to 
enunciate a clear policy with respect to 
the conduct of electronic votes. 

As Members are aware, clause 5 of 
rule XV provides that Members shall 
have not less than 15 minutes in which 
to answer an ordinary rollcall vote or 
quorum call. The rule obviously establishes 
15 minutes as a minimum. Still, 
with the cooperation of the Members, a 
vote can easily be completed in that 
time. On occasion, the Chair has announced, 
and then strictly enforced, a 
policy of closing electronic votes as 
soon as possible after the guaranteed 
period of 15 minutes. Members appreciated 
and cooperated with the Chair’s 
enforcement of the policy on that occasion. 


The Chair desires that those examples 
be made the regular practice of 
the House. To that end, the Chair enlists 
the assistance of all Members in 
avoiding the unnecessary loss of time 
in conducting the business of the 
House. The Chair encourages all Members 
to depart for the Chamber prompt

ly upon the appropriate bell and light 
signal. As in recent Congresses, the 
cloakrooms should not forward to the 
Chair requests to hold a vote by electronic 
device, but should simply apprise 
inquiring Members of the time remaining 
on the voting clock. 

Although no occupant of the chair 
would prevent a Member who is in the 
well of the Chamber before the announcement 
of the result from casting 
his or her vote, each occupant of the 
chair will have the full support of the 
Speaker in striving to close each electronic 
vote at the earliest opportunity. 
Members should not rely on signals relayed 
from outside the Chamber to assume 
that votes will be held open until 
they arrive in the Chamber.

circumstances which make it clear that the 
gift is given for a nonbusiness purpose and is 
motivated by a family relationship or close 
personal friendship and not by the position 
of the Member, officer, or employee shall not 
be subject to the prohibition in subparagraph 
(1). 

‘‘(B) A gift shall not be considered to be 
given for a nonbusiness purpose if the Member,

‘‘(ii) direct or indirect reimbursement or 
any other compensation for the value of the

term ‘gift’ means any gratuity, favor, discount, 
entertainment, hospitality, loan, forbearance, 
or other item having monetary 
value. The term includes gifts of services, 
training, transportation, lodging, and meals, 
whether provided in kind, by purchase of a

Member, officer, or employee (or a gift to 
any other individual based on that individual’s 
relationship with the Member, officer,

Mr. SPRATT (during the reading). 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that the motion to commit be considered 
as read and printed in the RECORD. 

The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentleman from 
South Carolina? 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, reserving 
the right to object, and I will not object, 
the point I want to make is that 
this is a question on the gift ban and 
on the book royalty at this point. 

Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation 
of objection. 

Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, reserving 
the right to object, I would just say 
to the gentleman, we have just been 
handed a 20-page document here. This 
is the motion to recommit? 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 

Mr. SOLOMON. I yield to the gentleman 
from Michigan. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, this is the 
motion to commit. 

Mr. SOLOMON. To commit? 

Mr. BONIOR. If the gentleman will 

yield further, yes. This is what we were 
talking about for the last hour, the ban 
on gifts from lobbyists and book royalties. 



H 22 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 1995 

Mr. SOLOMON. I do not know how 
that, with no debate, Mr. Speaker, we 
are going to have time to even know 
the details of this. 

I would urge a no vote. 

Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, 
the gentleman makes a good point 
about debate. Would the gentleman 
agree to unanimous consent for about 
20 minutes to debate this? Then we can 
discuss it. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
for an additional 20 minutes. 

Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I would 
move regular order. 

Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, I have a unanimous-consent 
request. What happened to my unanimous-
consent request? 

Mr. THOMAS of California. Mr. 
Speaker, reserving the right to object—— 


Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, there is a 
unanimous-consent request to dispense 
with the reading of the 20-page motion. 

The SPEAKER. That is the pending 
request. There can only be one request 
pending at a time. 

Mr. VOLKMER. Mr. Speaker, reserving 
the right to object, it is apparent 
to me that, as one who has been here 
for several years and has seen what has 
gone on in past first days of the Congress, 
I attempted and my staff attempted, 
beginning back in December, 
to get a copy of the proposed new 
House rules for this Congress. We have 
not been able to. 

Mr. THOMAS of California. Regular 
order, Mr. Speaker. 

Mr. VOLKMER. I am reserving the 
right to object. 

The SPEAKER. The gentleman may 
not reserve the right to object if regular 
order is requested. 

Is there objection to the request to 
dispense with the reading? 

Does the gentleman still tender his 
request? 

Mr. SPRATT. What I seek, Mr. 
Speaker, is that we dispense with the 
reading of the motion. 

The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentleman from 
South Carolina? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I object. 


The SPEAKER. The Member was not 
on his feet, and it was not timely. 

The question is on the motion to 
commit. 

The question was taken; and the 
Speaker announced that the noes appeared 
to have it. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 

The yeas and nays were ordered. 

The SPEAKER. The Members are reminded 
that this is a 15-minute vote, 
with a maximum of 2 additional minutes. 


The vote was taken by electronic device,

2), may have more than one Member reflected 
as a first sponsor. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
WALKER). Pursuant to House Resolution 
5, the resolution is initially debatable 
for 30 minutes. 

The gentleman from Texas [Mr. 
ARMEY] will be recognized for 15 minutes, 
and the gentleman from Michigan 
[Mr. BONIOR] will be recognized for 15 
minutes. 

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas [Mr. ARMEY]. 

Mr. ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 4 minutes. 

(Mr. ARMEY asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, this is a 
gratifying day for America, a day of 
hope and promise for our country. And 
so it is with a profound sense of honor 
that I offer, on behalf of the Republican 
Members of the House, this proposed 
set of rules for the 104th Congress. 


I am very proud of this rules package. 
I believe it will dramatically 
alter—and I predict improve—the way 
in which the House conducts the American 
people’s business. 

The distinguished chairman of the 
Rules Committee, Mr. SOLOMON, and 
others will offer more detailed explanations 
of the provisions. Allow me at 
this point simply to sketch for you our 
three principal goals—responsibility, 
reform, and renewal. 

Our first goal is greater responsibility 
with the people’s money. We will 
reduce the size and cost of a Congress 
that has grown unchecked for too 
many years. We will slash the number 
of committees and subcommittees, and 
reduce committee staff by a third, saving 
taxpayers about $40 million a year. 

b1650 

We will stop the funding of 28 special-
interest caucuses that cost $5 million a 
year. And we have even managed to 
save $300,000 a year by ending so-called 
commemorative legislation like National 
Pizza and Pasta Day. 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H 31 

It’s time for truth in budgeting. 
From now on, in the budget process, 
when we speak of a spending cut, we 
will mean an actual cut in spending, 
not just a smaller increase. 

Over on the other side of the Capitol, 
our Senate colleagues actually have a 
rule requiring a super-majority to cut 
taxes. Well, is it not about time we put 
our thumb on the spending-cut side of 
the scale? House rules will now require 
a three-fifths majority to raise taxes. 

Our second goal is reform. We want 
to make the House more accountable 
to the American people. We are throwing 
open the shutters and letting the 
sun shine in on committee meetings. 
We are banning proxy voting and so-
called rolling quorums. 

This way, Members of Congress will 
devote more energy to their all-important 
committee work, knowing that, 
from now on, they will have to be physically 
present to cast votes on behalf of 
their constituents, rather than delegating 
that high privilege. 

And we are making the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD a true verbatim transcript 
of debate, instead of ‘‘revisionist 
history’’ Members can totally rewrite 
after the fact. 

Our third goal, Mr. Speaker, is renewal. 
We hope to promote a renewal 
of respect for this historic institution. 
And that begins with a renewal of respect 
for the people who sent us here. 
It begins with a Congress that obeys 
the same laws it imposes on private 
citizens. 

Renewal means more accountability 
on the part of those entrusted with 
power. And that’s why we impose a 
healthy, 6-year term limit on committee 
chairmen. 

We also feel—and I know you enthusiastically 
concur, Mr. Speaker—that 
there should be an 8-year term limit on 
the Speaker, the same number of years 
allowed the President. 

Allow me to end on a personal note. 
I would love to see bipartisan support 
for these rules, because this is not a 
Republican House. This was not previously 
a Democratic House. This is 
the American people’s House, and we 
must restore their faith in this historic 
and honorable institution. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
WALKER). The Chair would remind all 
persons in the gallery that they are 
here as guests of the House and that 
any manifestation of approval or disapproval 
of proceedings is a violation 
of the rules of the House. 

The gentleman from Texas may proceed. 


Mr. ARMEY. I repeat, we must restore 
their faith in this historic and 
honorable institution. 

I hope today will set a standard for a 
more cooperative, more idea-driven 
process in which our first and highest 
consideration is always the people’s 
business. 

I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on these historic rules on this 
historic day. 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Mr. BONIOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gentleman 
from South Carolina [Mr. 
SPRATT], a member of the leadership. 

(Mr. SPRATT asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 

The previous Member just described 
this as a day of promise, a day for raising 
standards of this institution, and 
this is a historic occasion. We will miss 
a historic, major opportunity to 
change the way this institution of the 
Congress is perceived if we do not add 
to this rules package before us the ban 
on gifts from lobbyists which this 
House passed just months ago by an 
overwhelming vote of 315 to 111. 

There are many things in this package, 
this rules proposal, that I can and 
will gladly support. Let us be frank 
about it: Committee proxy voting, 
super majorities, baseline budgeting, 
this is Capitol Hill jargon. Some people 
out in the country get it; most do not, 
and most could care less. But everybody 
understands what gifts from lobbyists 
is all about. That is why we got 
315 votes for it the last time it was before 
the House. 

If we want to open up this institution, 
if we want to freshen its image, 
redeem its reputation among the 
American people, then we need to sever 
the ties, real and perceived, between 
those who work inside this institution 
and represent the people as a whole, 
and those who work Congress from the 
outside, the lobbyists, Gucci Gulf, the 
lobbyists who represent special interests 
and limited numbers of people. 

Just a few months ago this ban on 
gifts from lobbyists was good enough 
for 315 Members. The provisions that 
some found problematic then that 
dealt with grassroots lobbying were 
purged from the Democratic proposal 
today. We did add one provision that is 
contentious. It would limit, not ban, 
limit the amount of royalties that a 
Member could earn while sitting as a 
Member of this House on publications 
written while he is sitting. But the 
limit is a third of your salary while 
serving here, which is a generous dispensation 
for full-time Members who 
are paid full-time salaries. With such 
enormous support, 315 yeas, why not 
vote on this package today and make it 
the rule of the House from day one? 

Mr. ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
balance of my time to the distinguished 
gentleman from New York [Mr. 
SOLOMON], chairman of the Committee 
on Rules. 

(Mr. SOLOMON asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks 
and to include extraneous material.) 


Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

Mr. Speaker, a new day is here. 

Today we begin the first stage of a 
commitment that was made to the 

American people last November—indeed, 
a Contract With America that 
was signed by the new majority—to restore, 
renew, and reform the people’s 
House. 

The resolution before us today, 
adopting the Rules of the House for the 
104th Congress, is the initial fulfillment 
of that Contract With America. 
It makes the most sweeping and comprehensive 
reform of this House in the 
last half century. 

It brings back to the people’s House 
the intangible words, ‘‘openness, fairness, 
and accountability.’’ 

But, even more importantly, by setting 
the example of substantially reducing 
the committees and staff of the 
Congress, we begin the process of 
shrinking the size and power of the 
Federal Government. 

What we are proposing today in this 
resolution is unprecedented, both in 
form and in substance. Instead of the 
usual 1 hour of debate on this resolution, 
we have committed to 31/2 hours of 
debate. Instead of the usual single vote 
on this resolution, we have committed 
to nine separate votes. 

After this initial general debate period 
of 30 minutes, we will proceed to 
debate for 20 minutes each on the eight 
opening day reforms contained in our 
Contract With America, followed by a 
separate vote on each. 

Those reforms include— 

First, a comprehensive reform of our 
committee system, including a one-
third cut in committee staff, a reduction 
of over 20 subcommittees, and a 
consolidation of committee staff funding 
into a publicly disclosed, 2-year 
funding resolution; 

Second, a truth-in-budgeting baseline 
reform provision that measures next 
year’s budget against this year’s spending 
levels instead of inflated baseline 
spending levels; 

Third, a four-term limit on the 
Speaker of the House, and three-term 
limit on committee and subcommittee 
chairmen; 

Fourth, a ban on proxy or ghost voting 
in committees; 

Fifth, a committee sunshine rule to 
ensure that all committee meetings 
and hearings are open to the public and 
the media; 

Sixth, a required three-fifths vote on 
any bill increasing income tax rates, 
and a prohibition against retroactive 
tax increases; 

Seventh, a comprehensive audit of all 
House books to ferret out past waste, 
fraud, and abuse in this House so that 
we can operate this House in the future 
in an open and fiscally sound manner; 
and 

Eighth, the consideration of a bill 
that will make the Congress subject to 
the same laws that now apply to the 
private sector. 

Mr. Speaker, following the debate 
and votes on those opening day contract 
items, we will proceed for an additional 
20 minutes to debate and then 
vote on title II of this resolution which 
contains 23 additional reforms of this 


H 32 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 1995 

House which have been long overdue, 
including—comprehensive reform of 
the administrative structure of the 
House; a reduction in the number of 
committees and an overhaul of their 
jurisdictions; a requirement for more 
comprehensive oversight of the executive 
branch by our committees; a publication 
of all committee rollcall votes; 
a reform of our appropriations process; 
a requirement that our CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD and committee transcripts be 
an accurate account of words actually 
spoken; a ban on so-called commemorative 
bills; and a ban on taxpayer-
funded special interest caucuses. 

Mr. Speaker, I could go on and discuss 
the many other reform items in 
this rules resolution, but, in the interest 
of allowing other Members to participate 
in this debate, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 

A CONTRACT FOR A NEW HOUSE 
(A section-by-section summary of H. Res. —, 
adopting the Rules of the House for the 

104th Congress, to be offered by the Major


ity Leader, or a designee.) 

The Rules of the House of the 103rd Congress 
would be adopted as the rules for the 
104th Congress together with the following 
amendments: 

TITLE I. CONTRACT WITH AMERICA: A BILL OF 
ACCOUNTABILITY 

[Note: Each section below in Title I would 
be under a separate introductory paragraph 
adopting House Rules from the 103rd Congress 
as the Rules of the 104th Congress with 
the additional amendment(s) in the section, 
thereby permitting a division of the question 
and separate debate and vote on each of the 
8 Contract items. The 23 items in Title II, on 
the other hand, would be subject to a single 
vote.] 

Sec. 101. Committee, Subcommittee and 
Staff Reforms: Committee staff in the 104th 
Congress is reduced by at least one-third 
from comparable levels in the 103rd Congress. 
No committee could have more than 5 
subcommittees (except Appropriations which 
could have no more than 13; Government Reform 
and Oversight, no more than 7; and 
Transportation and Infrastructure, no more 
than 6). Statutory and investigative staff 
salary authorization levels would be consolidated 
in a single, 2-year committee expense 
resolution (except for the Committee on Appropriations). 
The distinction between professional 
and clerical staff would be eliminated 
while retaining the overall core staff 
of 30 for each committee (20-majority, 10-minority, 
or a one-third guarantee to the minority 
if less than 30). Committee chairmen 
would be required to ensure that sufficient 
staff is made available to each subcommittee 
to exercise its responsibilities under committee 
rules, including fair treatment to the 
minority in subcommittee staffing. Interim 
funding authority for House committees, 
consistent with planned staff reductions, 
would be provided pending the adoption of 
the primary expense resolution for 1995–96. 

Sec. 102. Truth-in-Budgeting Baseline Reform: 
Cost estimates in committee reports 
would include a comparison of total estimated 
funding for the program(s) to the appropriate 
levels under current law. 

Sec. 103. Term Limits for Speaker, Committee 
and Subcommittee Chairmen: Beginning 
with the 104th Congress: (a) No person 
could serve as Speaker for more than four 
consecutive Congresses (disregarding any 
service for less than a session). (b) No Member 
could be the chairman of any committee, 
or of the same subcommittee of a commit


tee, for more than three consecutive Congresses 
(excluding any service for less than a 
session in a Congress). 

Sec. 104. Proxy Voting Ban: No vote could 
be cast by proxy on any committee or subcommittee 
thereof. 

Sec. 105. Committee Sunshine Rules: Committee 
meetings, which can now be closed for 
any reason, could only be closed by majority 
rollcall vote if disclosure would endanger national 
security, compromise sensitive law 
enforcement information, or tend to defame, 
degrade or incriminate any person. Broadcast 
coverage of any committee or subcommittee 
meeting or hearing open to the 
public would be a right (not requiring a vote 
of approval as at present). 

Sec. 106. Limitations on Tax Increases: (a) 
No bill, joint resolution, amendment or conference 
report carrying an income tax rate 
increase, could be considered as passed or 
agreed to unless so determined by a vote of 
at least three-fifths of the House. (b) No 
measure of amendment could be considered 
that contains a retroactive income tax rate 
increase. 

Sec. 107. Comprehensive House Audit: The 
Inspector General would be authorized to 
contract with one or more independent auditing 
firms to conduct a comprehensive 
audit of House financial records, physical assets, 
and operational facilities. 

Sec. 108. Consideration of ‘‘Congressional 
Accountability Act’’: The majority leader, or 
a designee, would be authorized to call up for 
consideration on Jan. 4, 1995, a bill (H.R. 1), 
the ‘‘Congressional Accountability Act of 
1995,’’ subject to one-hour of debate in the 
House, divided equally between the majority 
leader and minority leader, or their designees, 
and to one motion to recommit. 

TITLE II. GENERAL 
Sec. 201. House Administrative Reforms: 
The Office of Doorkeeper would be abolished 
and its functions transferred to the Sergeant-
at-Arms. A Chief Administrative Officer, 
elected by the House, would replace the 
Director of Financial and Non-Legislative 
Services. The authority of the Inspector 
General would be broadened to audit all 
House functions and to refer possible violations 
of rules or law to the ethics committee 
for action or possible referral to the appropriate 
Federal or State authorities. 
Sec. 202. Changes in Committee System: 
The Committees on Post Office and Civil 
Service, and the District of Columbia would 
be abolished and their jurisdiction transferred 
to the Committee on Government Reform 
and Oversight; the Committee on Merchant 
Marine and Fisheries would be abolished 
and its jurisdiction transferred to the 
committees on National Security, Resources, 
and Transportation and Infrastructure. The 
Committee on Budget would be given shared 
legislative jurisdiction over certain budgetary 
legislation. Term limits for members 
of the Budget Committee would be changed 
from three-terms in any five Congresses to 
four-terms in any six Congresses. Other committees 
would be renamed and jurisdictions 
transferred. 
Sec. 203. Oversight Reform: Committees 
would be required to adopt oversight plans 
for the Congress and submit them to the 
Committee on House Oversight and Government 
Reform and Oversight by Feb. 15th of 
the first session. The Committee on House 
Oversight and Government Reform and Oversight 
would report the plans to the House by 
March 31st together with any recommendations 
of the committee or joint leadership to 
ensure maximum coordination. Committees 
would be required to include an oversight 
section in their final activity reports reporting 
on the implementation of their plans. 
The Speaker would be authorized to appoint 

ad hoc oversight committees, subject to 
House approval, for specific oversight 
projects from committees sharing jurisdiction. 


Sec. 204. Member Assignment Limits: No 
Member could have more then two standing 
committee and four subcommittee assignments 
(except committee chairman and 
ranking minority members could serve as ex 
officio members of all subcommittees of 
their committees). Any exception to the assignment 
limits must be approved by the 
House upon the recommendation of the respective 
party caucus or conference. 

Sec. 205. Multiple Bill Referral Reform: 
The joint referral of bills to two or more 
committees would be prohibited. The speaker 
would designate a committee of primary 
jurisdiction when a bill is introduced, may 
refer parts of bills to appropriate committees, 
and may sequentially refer bills, either 
upon introduction or after the primary committee 
has reported, subject to time limits 
for reporting. 

Sec. 206. Accuracy of Committee Transcripts: 
Committee hearing and meeting 
transcripts shall be a substantially verbatim 
account of remarks made during proceedings, 
subject only to technical grammatical, 
and typographical corrections authorized by 
the person making the remarks involved. 

Sec. 207. Elimination of ‘‘Rolling 
Quorums’’: The existing ‘‘rolling quorum’’ 
rule which allows drop-by voting to report 
measures and permits less than a quorum to 
report if no point of order is raised, would be 
repealed. 

Sec. 208. Prohibition on Committee Meetings 
During House Consideration of Amendments: 
No Committee (except the Committees 
on Appropriations, Rules, Standards and 
Ways and Means) could sit while the House is 
reading a measure for amendment under the 
five-minute rule without special leave 
(which shall be granted unless 10 members 
object), or unless upon the adoption of a motion 
offered by the majority leader which 
shall be privileged. No committee could sit 
while the House and Senate are meeting in 
joint session or when a joint meeting of the 
House and Senate is in progress. 

Sec. 209. Accountability for Committee 
Votes: Committee reports on any bill or 
other matter would include the names of 
those voting for and against on rollcall votes 
on any amendments or on the motion to report 
a measure. 

Sec. 210. Affirming Minority’s Rights on 
Motions to Recommit: The Rules Committee 
could not report a special rule denying the 
minority the right to offer amendatory instructions 
in a motion to recommit if offered 
by the minority leader or a designee. 

Sec. 211. Waiver Policy for Special Rules: 
The Committee on Rules would be required, 
to the maximum extent possible, to specify 
in any special rule providing for the consideration 
of a measure any provisions of House 
rules being waived. 

Sec. 212. Prohibition on Delegate Voting in 
Committee of Whole: The Resident Commissioner 
of Puerto Rico and the Delegates from 
Guam, Virgin Islands, American Samoa and 
the District of Columbia could not vote in or 
preside over the Committee of the Whole. 

Sec. 213. Accuracy of Congressional 
Record: The Congressional Record would be a 
verbatim account of proceedings, subject 
only to technical, grammatical and typographical 
corrections by the Member speaking. 
Unparliamentary remarks may be deleted 
only by unanimous consent or order of 
the House. 

Sec. 214. Automatic Roll Call Votes: Automatic 
roll call votes would be required on 
final passage of bills making appropriations, 
raising taxes, and conference reports there



January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H 33 

on; and on final adoption of budget resolutions 
and their conference reports. 

Sec. 215. Appropriations Reforms: Limitation 
amendments could be offered to appropriations 
bills at the end of the regular 
amendment process without having to first 
defeat the motion to rise and report. A motion 
to rise could only be offered by the majority 
leader (or a designee) if limitation 
amendments are still pending. Non-emergency 
items could not be reported or offered 
as amendments to emergency spending bills 
(except to rescind budget authority or reduce 
direct spending to pay for the emergency 
benefits). Off-setting, deficit neutral amendments 
could be offered en bloc to any appropriations 
measure. Reports on all appropriations 
bills would be required to include not 
only a listing of legislative provisions contained 
in the measures (as presently required), 
but of all unauthorized activities 
being funded by the measure (except for classified 
intelligence or national security programs). 
Points of order would automatically 
be reserved against an appropriations bill 
when filed. 

Sec. 216. Ban on Commemoratives: No bill, 
resolution or amendment could be introduced 
or considered in the House that establishes 
or expresses any commemoration (defined 
as any remembrance, celebration or 
recognition for any purpose) for a specified 
time period (e.g., day, week, month). The 
Committee on Government Reform and Oversight 
would be directed to consider alternative 
means of establishing commemorations, 
such as an independent or Executive 
Branch Commission, and to report to the 
House any recommendations. 

Sec. 217. Numerical Designation of Amendments 
Submitted for Record: Amendments 
submitted for the amendments section of the 
Congressional Record for any bill would be 
given numerical designations in the order 
printed for that bill to facilitate easy reference 
by Members and committees. 

Sec. 218. Pledge of Allegiance: The Pledge 
of Allegiance would be required in the House 
as the third order of business each day. 

Sec. 219. Discharge Petitions: The Clerk 
would be required to publish the names of 
new signers of discharge petitions in the last 
Congressional Record of each week and make 
available to the public through an appropriate 
office the current names of signers on 
a daily basis. The Clerk shall also devise a 
system for making the names of signers 
available to House offices and the public 
through electronic form. 

Sec. 220. Protection of Classified Materials: 
The Code of Official Conduct would be 
amended to require that, prior to having access 
to any classified materials, Members, 
officers and employees take an oath not to 
disclose such materials except as authorized 
by the House or its Rules. 

Sec. 221. Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence: The House Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence would be reduced 
in size from 19 to 16 members, with a 9–7 majority 
to minority ratio. Member terms 
would be increased from three to four and 
the chairman and ranking minority member 
could serve a fifth term if they held the 
those positions for only one Congress. The 
Speaker (currently the majority leader) and 
minority leader would serve as ex officio, 
non-voting members, and may designate a 
member of their leadership staff to assist 
them and have access to committee proceedings 
and materials, as if committee staff, 
subject to the same security clearance and 
confidentiality requirements as committee 
staff. Current jurisdictional arrangements 
would be clarified. 

Sec. 222. Abolition of Legislative Service 
Organizations: The establishment or continuation 
of any Legislative Service Organi


zation (as defined and authorized by regulation 
in the 103rd Congress) would be prohibited 
in the 104th Congress. The Committee 
on House Oversight would be directed to 
take necessary steps to ensure the orderly 
termination and accounting for funds of 
LSOs in existence on Jan. 4, 1995. 

Sec. 223. Miscellaneous Provisions and 
Clerical Corrections: The Speaker’s authority 
to postpone votes on certain matters 
would include postponing the previous question 
vote on those matters. The Speaker’s 
authority to reduce time for voting to 5-minutes 
after a 15-minute vote on the previous 
question would extend to any previous question 
vote (currently applies only to previous 
question vote on special rules from the Rules 
Committee). There would be established a 
Speaker’s Office for Legislative Floor Activities, 
with employees to be appointed by the 
Speaker to assist in the management of legislative 
floor activity. The Chairman of a 
committee could designate any member of 
the committee or a subcommittee as the vice 
chairman of the committee or subcommittee. 
Members would be prohibited from using 
any personal, electronic office equipment 
(including cellular phones, and laptop computers) 
on the House floor. Certain specified, 
priority measures introduced on Jan. 4, 1995, 
could have more than one prime sponsor. 

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF HOUSE 

RULES RESOLUTION 

(H. Res.——, Adopting House Rules, 104th 
Congress, January 5, 1995) 
TITLE I. CONTRACT WITH AMERICA: A BILL OF 
ACCOUNTABILITY 

Title I of the resolution contains eight sections 
relating to the ‘‘Opening Day Checklist’’ 
of House reforms contained in the 
‘‘Contract with America.’’ Each section is 
preceded by an identical introductory paragraph 
adopting the rules of the previous Congress 
together with the amendment(s) in 
that section in order to permit a division of 
the question vote on each section. 

Sec. 101. Committee, Subcommittee and 
Staff Reforms: (a) Committee staff reductions.—
Subsection (a) requires that the number 
of House committee staff in the 104th 
Congress be at least one-third less than the 
corresponding total in the 103rd Congress. It 
is the intent of the resolution that this reduction 
be achieved at the outset of the new 
Congress. The Committee on House Oversight 
will be responsible for overseeing the 
reductions and enforcing them through the 
committee funding process. 

(b) Subcommittee reductions.—Subsection 
(b) replaces clause 6(d) of House rule X which 
currently requires all committee having 
more than 20 members to establish at least 
four subcommittees. In its place, the new 
paragraph requires that committees establish 
no more than six subcommittees. The 
only exceptions are the committees on Appropriations 
(13). Government Reform and 
Oversight (7), and Transportation and Infrastructure 
(6). 
This paragraph should be read in the context 
of sec. 204 of the resolution which limits 
Members to no more than four subcommittee 
assignments. In that section, subcommittee 
is defined as ‘‘any panel (other than a special 
oversight panel of the Committee on National 
Security), task force, special subcommittee, 
or any subunit of a standing 
committee that is established for a cumulative 
period longer than six months in any 
Congress.’’ The intent of these two limitations 
is to make both Member and committee 
work more deliberative, participatory, 
and manageable by reducing scheduling conflicts 
and jurisdictional overlap. This is especially 
important given the ban on proxy voting 
in committees. 

(c) Consolidated committee staff and biennial 
funding.—Subsection (c) amends clause 
5 of rule XI (‘‘Committee Expenses’’) in two 
important respects. First, it requires that all 
committee staff salaries and expenses be authorized 
in an expense resolution reported by 
the Committee on House Oversight. At 
present, only investigative staff salaries and 
expenses are funded through expense resolutions 
while so-called statutory staff (see 
amendments to rule XI clause 6 below), are 
paid for directly from appropriations. 

Second, the subsection provides for one 
primary expense resolution per Congress instead 
of one each session. This is the system 
currently in effect in the Senate. The purpose 
for the biennial resolution is to permit 
committee to plan for a full Congress and to 
free-up the time otherwise consumed by the 
House and its committees on processing two 
budgets per Congress. 

The ability of committees to request additional 
or supplemental expense resolutions 
in a Congress is preserved. The only committee 
exempted from this consolidated funding 
process will be Appropriations which has 
been traditionally exempt to avoid undue 
pressures on its funding decisions. The Budget 
Committee, which has been exempt from 
the funding process since its formation in 
1975, would be brought under the funding 
process by this rule change. 

The resolution contains a free-standing, interim 
funding rule for committees until 
their expense resolutions are adopted. This 
permits committees to incur expenses consistent 
with their planned staff reductions. 

Clause 5(d) of rule XI is amended to require 
that committee chairmen make available to 
each subcommittee sufficient staff to carry 
out its responsibilities under committee 
rules, and that the minority is treated fairly 
in the appointment of subcommittee staff. 
This replaces an existing provision which entitles 
each subcommittee chairman and 
ranking minority member to appoint one 
staff person at a rate of pay up to 75% of the 
maximum allowable for committee staff. 

It is the intent of this provision to reestablish 
the primacy of committees over subcommittees 
while maintaining the ability of 
subcommittees to carry out their functions 
as arms of the parent committee. Nothing in 
this rule would prevent a committee chairman 
from allowing a subcommittee chairman 
to nominate a staff member for approval, 
either as a matter of policy or committee 
rule. But, it places ultimate authority 
over all committee staff in the full committee 
chairman and restores the line of responsibility 
of all such staff to the full committee. 


Subsection (d) amends clause 6 of rule XI 
(‘‘Committee Staffs’’) in several respects. 
First, it eliminates the distinction between 
professional and clerical staff so that all 30 
of the core committee staff are termed ‘‘professional.’’ 
Under existing rules, each committee 
may appoint 18 professional and 12 
clerical staff, with the minority entitled to 
one-third of each category. The one-third 
guarantee to the minority is retained, but 
with the difference that it would apply even 
if the committee appoints fewer than 30 
staff. 

The existing conditions that committee 
staff engage only in committee business during 
congressional working hours and not be 
assigned duties other than committee business 
are retained. However, the rule is 
amended to recognize the existence of shared 
or associate staff who may be paid from both 
Member clerk hire as well as committee 
funds. In such cases, the chairman must certify 
that their committee work is commensurate 
with their pay. It is the intent of this 
rule to permit a chairman to require by committee 
rule or policy that a supervising 


H 34 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 1995 

Member first certify the same to the chairman 
if a staff member is not working directly 
under the chairman. 

The new rule also makes clear that the employment 
of such shared or committee staff 
is subject to such terms, conditions, or limitations 
as may be established by the Committee 
on House Oversight. 

Sec. 102. Truth-in-Budgeting Baseline Reform: 
Subsection (a) amends House rule XI, 
clause 2(l)(3), relating to the contents of 
committee reports, to require that cost estimates 
submitted for reports on measures 
providing new budget authority shall include, 
when practicable, a comparison of the 
total estimated funding for the program (or 
programs), to the appropriate levels under 
current law. 

Subsection (b) inserts similar language in 
clause 7(a) of rule XIII, relating to cost estimates 
in committee reports (other than 
those of the Committees on Appropriations, 
Rules, House Oversight, and Standards of Official 
Conduct). 

These provisions apply to individual pieces 
of legislation and not to the budget in its entirety. 
The changes as they relate to discretionary 
spending authorizations will require 
that the cost estimates show the entire 
amount being authorized by current law. In 
virtually all instances this will be the entire 
amount of the program because the authorization 
will be either extending an expired 
authorization (in which case the current law 
is zero) or expanding an existing authorization 
(in which case the current law for expansion 
will be zero). Therefore, the rule will 
require that cost estimates for all legislation 
providing discretionary spending authorization 
show the entire amount being authorized. 
Cost estimates for discretionary appropriations 
will likewise show the entire 
amount being appropriated. 

The rule as applied to entitlement legislation 
will require that the cost estimate show 
the entire amount of spending estimated to 
occur due to the proposed legislation as well 
as the amount estimated under current law. 
This is a change from the previous method of 
scoring entitlement legislation which only 
showed the change from current law. Thus, if 
proposed entitlement legislation provides a 
lower rate of increase in spending than current 
law, the cost estimate will show that 
spending is increasing under the proposed 
legislation whereas previously the cost estimate 
would have shown only a reduction 
from current law. 

Sec. 103. Term Limits for Speaker, Committee 
and Subcommittee Chairmen: Subsection 
(a) amends rule I (‘‘Duties of the 
Speaker’’) by adding a new clause 8 at the 
end which prohibits any person from serving 
as House Speaker for more than four consecutive 
terms (excluding any service for 
less than a session of Congress), beginning 
with the 104th Congress. The eight year limit 
is consistent with the spirit of the current 
two-term limit on Presidents, with the exception 
of the term ‘‘consecutive.’’ 

While the rule cannot be made binding on 
future Congresses, since each has the constitutional 
authority to make its own rules, 
it does set a standard to go by which has 
been encouraged and agreed to by the new 
Speaker in the 104th Congress. 

Subsection (b) amends clause 6(e) of rule X 
which currently provides that all vacancies 
on House standing committees shall be filled 
by election by the House from nominations 
submitted by the respective party caucus or 
conference. The new sentence provides that 
no Member may serve as the chairman of the 
same standing committee or subcommittee 
for more than three consecutive Congresses, 
beginning with the 104th Congress. The purpose 
of this new limitation is not merely to 
allow other Members to assume leadership 

responsibilities sooner, but more importantly 
to prevent stagnation or too close a 
relationship to develop between committee 
leaders and the interests they oversee at the 
expense of balanced oversight and legislation. 


Sec. 104. Proxy Voting Ban: Subsection (a) 
amends House rule XI, clause 2, which currently 
permits proxy voting in committees, 
by prohibiting the use of proxies by any 
Member on any measure or matter before a 
committee. Subsection (b) simply makes a 
conforming change in clause 2(e)(1) of rule XI 
by striking a reference to proxy voting. 

The main purpose for this change is to ensure 
greater participation in committee deliberations 
and decisions so that the legislative 
product will be more representative and 
developed than if produced by a few members 
present. The overall aim of many of the committee 
reforms is to restore committees as 
the legislative workshops of the House. 

This rule does not apply to House-Senate 
conference committees which operate under 
joint rules agreed to by a particular conference. 
Conference committees, for instance, 
do not require an actual meeting to 
sign the report (though they must hold at 
least one meeting at some point)—only a majority 
of conferees from each House to sign 
the report. 

Sec. 105. Committee Sunshine Rules: Subsection 
(a) amends clause 2(g)(1) of rule XI, 
relating to open meetings to require that 
meetings which are open to the public shall 
also be open to the broadcast and photographic 
media. It also requires that meetings 
may only be closed by majority vote, with a 
majority present, if it is determined that 
matters to be disclosed would endanger national 
security, compromise sensitive law 
enforcement information, tend to defame, 
degrade or incriminate any person, or otherwise 
would violate any law or rule of the 
House. The subsection also strikes a provision 
allowing for a meeting to be closed to 
discuss internal budget or personnel matters. 

Under present House rules, a committee 
must vote to approve coverage of a meeting 
by radio, television and still photography. 
And, a meeting may be closed for any purpose 
by majority vote. 

Subsection (b) amends clause 2(g)(2) of rule 
XI, relating to open committee hearings, to 
require that any hearing open to the public 
is also open to the broadcast and photographic 
media and may only be closed by 
majority vote, a majority being present, for 
the same reasons stated in the open meeting 
rule above. 

The present House rule requires a majority 
vote to open a hearing to the broadcast and 
photographic media. It also prohibits closing 
a meeting except for all of the specified reasons 
above except one: the new rule adds the 
condition relating to the disclosure of ‘‘sensitive 
law enforcement information.’’ 

Unchanged is the present rule provision 
permitting a majority of a committee hearing 
quorum (which could be as few as two 
members if a committee has adopted such a 
quorum requirement as permitted by House 
rules) to vote to close a hearing either to discuss 
whether testimony or evidence to be received 
would endanger national security or, 
in the case of an investigatory hearing, 
would tend to defame, degrade or incriminate 
any person (see clause 2(k)(5) of rule 
XI); or if a majority of the same hearing 
quorum makes a determination at an investigatory 
hearing that testimony or evidence 
to be disclosed would tend to defame, degrade 
or incriminate any person. 

Subsection (c) amends clause 3(d) of rule 
XI, relating to the broadcasting of committee 
meetings or hearings, by striking the 
clause that makes coverage by the audio and 
visual media ‘‘a privilege made available by 

the House.’’ This reflects the new requirement 
that public meetings and hearings are 
automatically open to these media and does 
not require an affirmative vote of the committee. 


Subsection (d) amends paragraph (e) of 
clause 3, rule XI, by eliminating the requirement 
that a committee must vote to permit 
audio and visual media coverage except as 
provided in paragraph (f)(2). Paragraph (f)(2), 
which permits a subpoenaed witness to demand 
that audio and visual coverage of that 
witness’ testimony be prohibited, remains 
unchanged under the new rule. The subsection 
also provides that a committee or 
subcommittee may not limit television or 
photographic coverage to less than two representatives 
of each medium except for legitimate 
space or safety considerations, in 
which case pool coverage shall be authorized. 

Sec. 106. Limitations on Tax Increases: 
Subsection (a) amends clause 5 of rule XXI 
by adding a new paragraph (c) at the end requiring 
a three-fifths vote of the House to 
pass or agree to any bill, joint resolution, 
amendment or conference report carrying a 
Federal income tax rate increase. The three-
fifths vote would be of those present and voting. 
This should be read in the context of 
section 214 of the resolution which requires 
an automatic rollcall vote in the House on 
the final passage of any bill, joint resolution 
or conference report carrying a Federal income 
tax rate increase. 

Subsection (b) adds a new paragraph (d) to 
clause 5 or rule XXI prohibiting the consideration 
of any bill, joint resolution, amendment 
or conference report carrying a retroactive 
Federal income tax rate increase. For 
purposes of these rules the term ‘‘Federal income 
tax rate increase’’ is, for example, an 
increase in the individual income tax rates 
established in section 1, and the corporate 
income tax rates established in section 11, 
respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986. 

Sec. 107. Comprehensive House Audit: This 
section is a free-standing requirement that 
the Inspector General of the House, during 
the 104th Congress, in consultation with the 
Speaker and the Committee on House Oversight, 
conduct a comprehensive audit of 
House financial records and administrative 
operations, be authorized to contract with 
independent auditing firms for such purposes, 
and report the results of the audit as 
provided in House rule VI (‘‘Office of Inspector 
General’’), which requires the submission 
of any audit reports simultaneously to the 
Speaker, majority leader, and the chairman 
and ranking minority members of the Committee 
on House Oversight. 

Sec. 108. Consideration of the ‘‘Congressional 
Accountability Act’’: Sec. 108 is a freestanding, 
special rule, permitting the consideration 
in the House, at any time after the 
adoption of the House rules’ resolution, of 

H.R. 1 (104th Congress), a bill to make certain 
laws applicable to the legislative branch 
of the Federal Government, if offered by the 
majority leader or a designee. The special 
rule provides for one-hour of debate controlled 
equally by the majority and minority 
leaders, or their designees, and orders the 
previous question to final passage without 
intervening motion except one motion to recommit. 
The bill would not be subject to 
amendment unless offered as part of amendatory 
instructions in the motion to recommit. 
TITLE II. GENERAL 
Title II consists of 23 additional sections 
under a single introductory paragraph adopting 
the rules of the 103rd Congress together 
with the further amendments contained in 
those sections. As such, the 23 sections would 
not be subject to a division of the question 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H 35 

and separate votes. These would be a single Member, officer or employee of the House. sion, with a quorum present, its oversight 
vote on Title II following debate on it (and The Committee on Standards of Official Con-plans for that Congress, and to submit them 
on any vote on a motion to commit). duct would retain existing authority to refer to the committees on House Oversight and 

Sec. 201. Administrative Reforms: Sub-any possible law violations to the appro-Government Reform and Oversight. 

section (a) strikes from rule II references to 
the Doorkeeper as an elected House Officer 
(the office is abolished) and add the office of 
Chief Administrative Officer as a newly 
elected Officer of the House. 

Subsection (b) amends rule III (‘‘Duties of 
the Clerk’’) by adding two new clauses, 7 and 
8, requiring the Clerk to make semi-annual 
reports on finances and operations of the Office, 
to the Committee on House Oversight, 
and to cooperate with the appropriate offices 
and persons conducting performance reviews 
and audits of the Office’s finances and operations. 


Subsection (c) amends House rules IV, V, 
and VI as follows: 

Rule IV (‘‘Duties of the Sergeant-at-
Arms’’), is amended to reflect the assumption 
by the Sergeant-at-Arms of certain duties 
and responsibilities previously under the 
Doorkeeper; to require semi-annual reports 
be made to the Committee on House Oversight 
regarding the finances and operations 
of the Office; and to require cooperation with 
appropriate persons in the performance of reviews 
and audits. 

Rule V, previously relating to the ‘‘Duties 
of the Doorkeeper,’’ is replaced by a new rule 
relating to the ‘‘Chief Administrative Officer’’ 
who shall assume many of the duties 
and functions previously vested in the Director 
of Non-Legislative and Financial Services 
(rule VI, clause 1, 103rd Congress). Specifically, 
the Chief shall have operational 
and financial responsibility for functions assigned 
by the Speaker and Committee on 
House Oversight, subject to their policy direction 
and oversight. In addition, the Chief 
shall make semi-annual reports to the Committee 
on House Oversight on the finances 
and operations of the Office, and cooperate 
fully with appropriate offices and persons 
conducting performance reviews and audits. 

Rule VI, previously relating to the Director 
of Non-Legislative and Financial Services 
and the Office of Inspector General, is 
replaced by a new rule establishing the Office 
of Inspector General. The Office of Director 
of Non-legislative and Financial Services 
would be abolished by the adoption of 
this new rule. 

As with the previous rule VI, clause 2, the 
Inspector General is to be appointed by the 
Speaker, majority leader, and minority leader, 
acting jointly. The Inspector General 
would be subject to the policy direction and 
oversight of the Committee on House Oversight, 
and would be responsible for conducting 
periodic audits of the financial and administrative 
functions of the House and joint 
entities. The audit responsibilities of the 
previous Inspector General were confined to 
the financial functions under the Director of 
Non-legislative and Financial Services, the 
Clerk, the Sergeant-at-Arms and the Doorkeeper. 


The new responsibilities are therefore 
broadened to include all financial and administrative 
functions of the House and joint 
entities. The existing reporting and consultation 
requirements regarding any audits 
would be retained. Specifically, the Inspector 
General would be required to report simultaneously 
to the Speaker, majority leader, 
and the chairman and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on House Oversight 
any financial irregularities discovered, 
as well as on the final results of any audit. 

Moreover, the Inspector General is required 
to report to the Committee on Standards 
of Official Conduct any potential violations 
of House rules or laws applicable to the 
performance of official duties or the discharge 
of official responsibilities of any 

priate Federal or State authorities, subject 
to House approval, under clause 4(e)(1)(C) of 
rule X. 

Subsection (d) eliminates clause 3(j) of rule 
X which established a bipartisan Subcommittee 
on House Oversight of the former 
Committee on House Administration for the 
purpose of receiving audit reports and exercising 
oversight of the Clerk, Sergeant-at-
Arms, Doorkeeper, Director of Non-legislative 
and Financial Services, and the Inspector 
General. These responsibilities will be assumed 
by the full Committee on House Oversight. 


Subsection (e) amends clause 4(d) of rule X, 
regarding the additional functions of the 
Committee on House Oversight, by making 
conforming changes reflecting the committee’s 
new name and changes made in the 
other Offices of the House. 

Sec. 202. Changes in the Committee System: 
This section rewrites clause 1 of rule X 
(‘‘The Committees and Their Jurisdiction’’), 
to reflect the abolition of three committees—
District of Columbia, Merchant Marine 
and Fisheries, and Post Office and Civil 
Service—the transfer of their jurisdictions, 
and the renaming and jurisdictional changes 
in other standing committees of the House. 

Specifically, from the Committee on Merchant 
Marine and Fisheries, the national security 
aspects of merchant marine jurisdiction 
is transferred to the Committee on National 
Security (formerly Armed Services); 
the Coast Guard jurisdiction is transferred 
to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
(formerly Public Works and 
Transportation); and the fisheries, marine, 
non-national security aspects of the merchant 
marine, oceanographic affairs, and endangered 
species jurisdictions are transferred 
to the Committee on Resources (formerly 
Natural Resources). 

The Committee on Government Reform 
and Oversight (formerly Government Operations), 
would assume the jurisdictions of 
the committees on District of Columbia and 
Post Office and Civil Service, except for the 
Franking Commission which goes to House 
Oversight (formerly House Administration). 

Approximately 20 percent of the jurisdiction 
of the former Committee on Energy and 
Commerce (renamed the Committee on Commerce 
by this resolution) would go to the following 
committees: primary jurisdiction 
over Glass-Steagall reform legislation to the 
Committee on Banking and Financial Services 
(formerly Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs); consolidation of food inspection jurisdiction 
to the Committee on Agriculture; 
railroad jurisdiction to the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure; Trans-
Alaska Pipeline to the Committee on Resources; 
inland waterways jurisdiction to 
Transportation and Infrastructure; and consolidation 
of energy research and development 
jurisdiction under the Committee on 
Science. 

The Committee on the Budget would gain 
certain jurisdiction over budgetary legislation 
from the Committee on Government Reform 
and Oversight. 

Other committee names changes include: 
Economic and Educational Opportunities 
(formerly Education and Labor); and International 
Relations (formerly Foreign Affairs). 


Sec. 203. Oversight Reform: Subsection (a) 
adds two new subparagraphs (d) and (e) at 
the end of clause 2 of rule X (‘‘General Oversight 
Responsibilities’’). Paragraph (a) requires 
each standing committee of the 
House, no later than February 15 of the first 
session of a Congress, to adopt in open ses-

Committees shall, to the maximum extent 
feasible, consult with other committees having 
related jurisdictions to ensure coordination 
and cooperation in formulating and implementing 
oversight plans; give priority 
consideration to including in its plans the 
review of those laws, programs or agencies 
operating under permanent authority; and 
ensure that all laws within their jurisdictions 
are subject to oversight review at least 
once every ten years. 

No expense resolution could be considered 
for any committee which has not submitted 
its oversight plans to the Committee on 
House Oversight and the Committee on Government 
Reform and Oversight. Not later 
than March 31 of the first session of a Congress, 
after consulting with the Speaker and 
majority and minority leaders, the Committee 
on Government Reform and Oversight 
shall publish the oversight plans of the various 
committees, together with any recommendations 
made by the joint leadership 
group to ensure the most effective coordination 
of the plans. 

Paragraph (e) of rule X, clause 2, authorizes 
the Speaker, with the approval of the 
House, to appoint special, ad hoc oversight 
committees for the purpose of reviewing specific 
matters within the jurisdiction of two 
or more committees. 

Subsection (b) of the resolution amends 
clause 1(d) of rule XI, which now requires 
committee to submit an activity report at 
the end of each Congress, to include in such 
reports separate sections on the committees’ 
legislative and oversight activities, including 
a summary of the oversight plans submitted 
and actions taken and recommendations 
made with respect to each such plans, 
as well as any additional oversight activities 
undertaken by the committees. 

It is the intent of this section to ensure 
that committees make a more concerted, coordinated 
and conscientious effort to develop 
meaningful oversight plans at the beginning 
of each Congress and to follow-through on 
their implementation, with a view to examining 
the full range of the laws under their 
jurisdiction over a period of five Congresses. 

Sec. 204. Member Assignment Limits: 
Clause 6(b) of rule X, relating to committee 
memberships, would be amended by adding a 
new subparagraph (b) that would limit Members 
to no more than two standing committee 
assignments and four subcommittee assignments. 
The limitation would not apply 
to committee chairman and ranking minority 
members who serve as ex officio members 
of all subcommittees of their committees. 
Any exceptions to these limits must be approved 
by the House upon the recommendation 
of the respective party caucus or conference. 


The term subcommittee is defined for purposes 
of this subparagraph as any panel 
(other than a special oversight panel of the 
Committee on National Security), task 
force, special subcommittee, or any subunit 
of a committee that is established for a cumulative 
period of longer than six months in 
a Congress. 

It is the intent of this rule that any waivers 
by a party caucus or conference be specifically 
approved before it is presented to 
the House for consideration. If such party 
caucus or conference recommendations are 
specifically approved at the beginning of a 
Congress, the election of committees by the 
House will be considered as the requisite approval 
by the House of any exceptions to the 
committee limitation. However, any exceptions 
to the subcommittee limitation would 


H 36 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 1995 

have to be reported to the House from the respective 
party caucus or conference. 

Sec. 205. Multiple Referral Reform: Clause 
5(c) of rule X (‘‘Referral of Bills, Resolutions, 
and Other Matters to Committees’’) is 
amended to require the Speaker to designate 
a committee of primary jurisdiction upon 
the initial referral of a measure to a committee. 
The Speaker would have the discretion 
to also refer the same measure to other 
committees in sequence (sequential referral), 
either upon its initial introduction or after 
the primary committee has reported, subject 
to time limits for reporting by the secondary 
committees; or to refer designated portions 
of the same measure to other committees 
(split referral); or to refer a measure to a 
special ad hoc committee consisting of committees 
with shared jurisdictions over the 
measure. 

This rule change differs from the present 
referral rule in four significant respects. 
First, the designation of a committee of primary 
jurisdiction is designed to ensure 
greater accountability for legislation. Second, 
the rule eliminates so-called joint referrals 
which technically gave committees authority 
to consider the same portions of legislation 
as other committees (though referrals 
are always for consideration only of 
such provisions as fall within a committee’s 
jurisdiction). Third, giving the Speaker discretion 
to make sequential or split referrals 
allows more flexibility than the current requirement 
that every committee having any 
jurisdiction over a measure, no matter how 
minor, must receive a referral. And fourth, 
the ability of the Speaker to designate a secondary 
committee for sequential referral 
purposes upon the initial introduction of a 
measure will allow that committee to proceed 
with its work on the measure immediately, 
if it wishes. 

Nothing in this rule should be construed to 
prevent a secondary committee from reporting 
prior to the primary committee. However, 
it is the intent of the rule to the extent 
possible, to allow the primary committee to 
report before a measure is scheduled for floor 
consideration, unless it waives its right to 
report or the Speaker exercises discretion to 
impose a time limit on the primary committee 
for reporting and it fails to meet the 
deadline, in which case it will be considered 
to have been discharged of the measure. 

Sec. 206. Accuracy of Committee Transcripts: 
Clause 2(e)(1) of rule XI (‘‘Committee 
Records’’), is amended to require that committee 
transcripts shall be a substantially 
verbatim account of remarks actually made 
during proceedings, subject only to technical, 
grammatical, and typographical corrections 
authorized by the person making 
the remarks involved. 

The current rule requires committees to 
keep a complete record of all committee action, 
including a record of the votes on any 
question on which a rollcall vote is demanded. 
It is the intent of the new rule to 
require that where stenographic transcripts 
are kept of committee meetings or hearings, 
they not be subject to substantive changes 
by either the persons making the remarks or 
by staff. 

It is not the intent of this rule that all 
meeting and hearing transcripts be published. 
However, in those instances in which 
persons involved in a meeting or hearing are 
allowed to review and correct their remarks 
before publication of the transcripts, any 
corrections must be specifically authorized 
by that person and cannot alter the substantive 
content of the remarks. To the extent 
a person making remarks wishes to 
elaborate on any point, such substantive 
modifications should be treated the same as 
extensions of remarks on House floor speeches, 
i.e., they should be clearly delineated 

from remarks actually made by being printed 
in a typeface that is clearly distinguishable 
from verbatim remarks. 

Sec. 207. Elimination of ‘‘Rolling 
Quorums’’: Clause 2(l)(2)(A) of rule XI is 
amended by striking the existing provision 
which establishes a presumption that a committee 
majority was actually present at the 
time a measure is reported if the records of 
the committee show that a majority of the 
committee responded on a rollcall vote on 
the question, and prohibits a point of order 
to lie in the House that a majority was not 
present unless the point of order was timely 
made in the House. 

In so doing, the rule change restores the 
previous requirement that a ‘‘majority of the 
committee was actually present’’ at the time 
a measure was ordered reported. The fact 
that a committee orders a measure reported 
by voice vote without a quorum present, and 
no point of order is made at the time, does 
not prevent the point of order from being 
made in the House when the measure is 
called-up for consideration. 

It should also be emphasized that the requirement 
that a majority be actually 
present at the time the measure is reported 
from a committee means that a majority 
must be contemporaneously assembled at 
the time the vote is taken. Unlike a House 
floor vote during which Members may come 
and go during the course of a vote, the committee 
quorum rule, absent the old ‘‘rolling 
quorum’’ latitude, means a committee can 
no longer simply leave a vote open until a 
sufficient number of Members have responded 
to their names. Prior to the ‘‘rolling 
quorum’’ rule, the Committee on Rules has 
decided against granting a rule when presented 
with evidence that a majority was not 
actually present when the measure was reported. 


Sec. 208. Limitation on Committees’ 
Sittings: Clause 2(i) of rule XI, which currently 
prohibits committees from sitting 
during a joint, House-Senate session or 
meeting, would be amended to prohibit any 
committees except the committees on Appropriations, 
Budget, Rules, Standards of Official 
Conduct, and Ways and Means, from 
sitting while the House is reading a measure 
for amendment under the five-minute rule. 
Special leave to sit could be granted unless 
ten or more members object to a unanimous 
consent request, or upon the adoption by the 
House of a motion offered by the majority 
leader. This restores the rule in existence 
prior to the 103d Congress, with the only exception 
being the addition of a privileged 
motion by the majority leader. It is anticipated 
that the Speaker will again promulgate 
guidelines as to when and under what 
circumstances special leave may be requested. 


Sec. 209. Accountability for Committee 
Votes: Clause 2(l)(2)(B) of rule XI, which now 
requires that the results of any rollcall vote 
to report a measure be included in a committee 
report, would be amended to require that 
the names of those members voting for and 
against any amendment or motion to report 
a measure by rollcall vote be included in the 
committee report. 

It is the intent of this rule to provide for 
greater accountability for record votes in 
committees and to make such votes easily 
available to the public in committee reports. 
At present, under clause 2(e)(1) of rule XI, 
the public can only inspect rollcall votes on 
matters in the offices of committees. It is 
anticipated that with the availability of 
committee reports to the public through 
electronic form the listing of votes in reports 
will be more bill-specific than earlier proposals 
to publish all votes in the Congressional 
Record twice a year. 

Sec. 210. Affirming the Minority’s Right on 
Motions to Recommit: Clause 4(b) of rule XI, 

which, among other things, prohibits the 
Committee on Rules from denying a motion 
to recommit as provided in clause 4 of rule 
XVI, would be amended to clarify and ensure 
that such right includes the right to offer 
amendatory instructions, otherwise in order 
under the rules, in a motion to recommit, if 
offered by the minority leader or a designee. 

Exempted from this guarantee would be 
the motion to recommit a Senate bill or resolution 
for which the text of a House-passed 
measure has been substituted. This exemption 
recognizes that the minority would already 
have had the opportunity to offer a 
motion to recommit with instructions on the 
original House-passed measure being substituted 
for the Senate measure. 

It is the intent of this rule to restore the 
original purpose of clause 4(b) when it was 
adopted in 1909 to give the minority a final 
opportunity to offer an amendment of its 
choosing in a motion to recommit prior to 
the final passage of a bill. 

Sec. 211. Waiver Policy for Special Rules: 
Clause 4 of rule XI, relating to the Rules 
Committee, is amended by adding a new 
paragraph (e) at the end to require that 
whenever the Rules Committee reports a resolution 
providing for the consideration of a 
measure, it shall, to the maximum extent 
possible, specify in the resolution any House 
rules being waived against the measure or 
against its consideration. 

It is the intent of this rule that Members 
be fully informed as to what potential violations 
of House Rules are involved in considering 
a bill. This in turn will require committee 
chairmen to determine in advance of 
their Rules Committee appearance what 
waivers they will seek, and to be prepared to 
explain and defend those waivers before the 
Rules Committee. It is the ultimate intent of 
the rule change that Committee will be more 
careful prior to reporting a measure to ensure 
against any rules violations in the bill 
or report. 

While the failure of the Rules Committee 
to specify waivers in a rule would not give 
rise to a point of order against a special rule 
that waives all points of order, it is expected 
that the Rules Committee will, in all but the 
most time-sensitive situations, endeavor to 
determine what specific waivers are required 
and to detail them in the rule. 

Sec. 212. Prohibition on Delegate Voting in 
Committee of the Whole: Subsection (a) 
amends rule XII (‘‘Resident Commissioner 
and Delegates’’) by striking clause 2 which 
now entitles the Resident Commissioner 
from Puerto Rico and each Delegate to the 
House to the same powers and privileges in 
the Committee of the Whole on the state of 
the Union as other House Members. 

Subsection (b) amends clause 1 of rule 
XXIII (‘‘Of Committees of the Whole House’’) 
by striking ‘‘Resident Commissioner, or Delegate’’ 
as being eligible for appointment by 
the Speaker to chair the Committee of the 
Whole. 

Subsection (c) amends clause 2 of rule 
XXIII by striking paragraph (d) which provided 
for an immediate re-vote in the House 
whenever the votes of the Resident Commissioner 
and Delegates were decisive to the 
outcome of a vote in the Committee of the 
Whole. 

Sec. 213. Accuracy of the Congressional 
Record: Rule XIV (‘‘Of Decorum and Debate’’) 
is amended by adding a new clause 9 
requiring that the Congressional Record be a 
substantially verbatim account of remarks 
made during debate. Members could only authorize 
technical, grammatical and typographical 
corrections. Unparliamentary remarks 
could only be deleted by permission or 
order of the House. However, Members may 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H 37 

still insert undelivered remarks so long as 
they are delineated by a different typeface. 
Breaches of the rule could be subject to investigation 
by the Committee on Standards 
of Official Conduct. 

Sec. 214. Automatic Rollcall Votes: Rule 
XV (‘‘On Calls of the Roll and House’’) is 
amended by adding a new clause 7 to require 
an automatic rollcall vote on the final passage 
or adoption of any bill, joint resolution, 
or conference report, making general appropriations, 
increasing Federal income tax 
rates, or on final adoption of a budget resolution 
or a conference report thereon. 

Sec. 215. Appropriations Reforms: Subsection 
(a) amends clause 2(d) of rule XXI 
(‘‘On Bills’’) by providing that motions to 
rise and report an appropriations bill after 
the bill has been read for amendment shall 
only have precedence if offered by the majority 
leader or a designee. Under current rules, 
so-called limitation amendments not specifically 
contained or authorized in existing 
law, may only be offered if the motion to rise 
is not offered or is rejected after other 
amendments to the bill have been disposed 
of. The intent of the new rule is to permit 
the offering of limitation amendments at the 
end of the reading, subject only to a motion 
to rise offered by the majority leader or a 
designee. 

Subsection (b) adds a new paragraph (e) to 
clause 2 of rule XXI to prohibit reporting 
any non-emergency matter in an appropriations 
bill containing an emergency designation 
under the Budget Act. The only exceptions 
are for provisions which rescind budget 
authority, reduce direct spending authority, 
or reduce the amount for a designated emergency. 
While the Committee on Appropriations 
could evade this prohibition by giving 
an entire bill an emergency designation, it is 
the clear intent of this rule that no nonemergency 
items should be given such blanket 
coverage. Let exposed, as they should be, 
such non-emergency items would be subject 
to deletion if a point of order is made and 
sustained. 

It is not the intent of this rule to make in 
order any amendments not otherwise in 
order under the rules. Thus, any amendments 
to rescind or reduce direct spending 
must be germane to the bill as reported or be 
given special protection by way of a special 
rule reported by the Rules Committee and 
adopted by the House. 

Subsection (c) amends clause 2 of rule XXI 
by adding a new paragraph (f) to permit the 
offering of so-called offsetting amendments 
in appropriations bill. At present, appropriations 
measures are read for amendment by 
paragraph, meaning it is not possible to offer 
an amendment that is deficit neutral if it 
goes to paragraphs not yet pending. The new 
rule would allow the offering of such off-setting 
amendments en bloc and not subject to 
a division of the question in the House or the 
Committee of the Whole. 

When such an en bloc amendment is offered, 
and prior to the debate on it, the chair 
will ask whether there are any points of 
order against any portion of the bill covered 
by the amendment. If such a point of order is 
sustained, and the provision in the bill 
stricken, the amendment would no longer be 
in order as a proper offset. 

To qualify as an offsetting amendment for 
purposes of this paragraph, the proponent 
must be able to demonstrate that the net effect 
of the amendment would not increase 
overall budget authority or outlays in the 
bill. Since appropriations bills only contain 
the amount of budget authority being appropriated, 
it should be kept in mind that the 
off-setting numbers may not be the same 
since the ultimate test is whether the 
amendment does not increase the deficit— 
and deficits are determined by outlays in a 

fiscal year, not by the amount of budget authority 
appropriated for a particular matter. 
It will therefore be necessary for the author 
of an offsetting amendment to work closely 
with the Congressional Budget Office to ensure 
that the bottom line amendment makes 
equivalent increases and decreases in outlays 
resulting from the changes in budget authority. 


Subsection (d) amends clause 3 of rule XXI 
to require that the Committee on Appropriations 
include in its report a list of all appropriations 
contained in a bill for any expenditure 
not previously authorized by law (except 
for classified intelligence or national security 
programs, projects or activities). 
Clause 3 already requires that committee reports 
include a listing of legislative provisions 
contained in the bill. Since the point of 
order under clause 2 of rule XXI lies against 
both unauthorized and legislative provisions, 
it is only reasonable that the report should 
contain information on both. It is the intent 
of this rule that the test of compliance will 
be whether the committee has made a good 
faith effort to include all unauthorized matters 
in its report that it is aware of. The inadvertent 
omission of an unauthorized matter 
in a committee report will not give rise 
to a point of order against the consideration 
of the bill, though a point of order would 
still lie against the provision in the bill. 

Subsection (e) adds a new clause 8 to rule 
XXI to provide for the automatic reservation 
of points of order against provisions in an 
appropriations bill at the time the report on 
it is filed. Under current rules, the points of 
order under clause 2 of rule XXI are against 
the reporting of any unauthorized or legislative 
provision in an appropriations bill. This 
means that, for a point of order to be valid, 
it must be raised or reserved at the time the 
measure is actually reported, that is, at the 
time the report is filed in the House. This 
has required that a minority representative 
of the committee accompany the majority 
member filing the report in order to reserve 
points of order at the time the report is filed. 
Under the new rule, it will no longer be necessary 
to reserve points of order at the time 
an appropriations bill is filed. Members’ 
rights to later raise such points of order will 
automatically be protected. 

Sec. 216. Ban on Commemoratives: Subsection 
(a) amends clause 2 of rule XXII (‘‘Of 
Memorial, Bills and Resolutions’’) by prohibiting 
the introduction or consideration of 
any bill, resolution, or amendment which establishes 
or expresses any commemoration. 
For purposes of the new rule, a commemoration 
is defined as ‘‘any remembrance, celebration, 
or recognition for any purpose 
through the designation of a specified period 
of time.’’ 

The existing clause 2, which would be retained 
as paragraph (a), includes a similar 
prohibition against the receipt or consideration 
by the House of private bills, resolutions 
or amendments authorizing or directing 
the payment of money for certain property 
damages or for personal injury or death 
for which suit may be instituted under the 
Tort Claims procedure; for the construction 
of a bridge across a navigable stream; or for 
the correction of a military or naval record. 

The new ban on date-specific commemorative 
measures or amendments applies to both 
the introduction and consideration of any 
measure containing such a commemorative. 
This is intended to include measures in 
which such a commemorative may only be 
incidental to the overall purpose of the 
measure. Such measures will be returned to 
the sponsor if they are dropped in the legislative 
hopper. The prohibition against consideration 
also extends to any measures received 
from the Senate which contain date-
specific commemorative. While it does not 

block their receipt from the other body, it is 
intended that such measures would not be 
referred to the appropriate committee of the 
House or be considered by the House. Instead, 
they would simply be held at the desk 
without further action. Should such a commemorative 
be included in a conference report 
or Senate amendment to a House bill, 
the entire conference report or Senate 
amendment would be subject to a point of 
order. 

While the ban does not apply to commemorative 
which do not set aside a specified period 
of time, and instead simply call for 
some form of national recognition, it is not 
the intent of the rule that such alternative 
forms should become a new outlet for the 
consideration of such measures. Thus, while 
they could be referred to an appropriate 
committee, it is not expected that such committees 
should feel obligated or pressured to 
establish special rules for their release to the 
House floor. Nor should it be expected that 
the Rule Committee should become the new 
avenue for regular waivers of the rule 
against date specific commemorative. Such 
exceptions should be limited to those rare 
situations warranting special national recognition 
as determined by the Leadership. 

Subsection (b) is a free-standing directive 
to the Committee on Government Reform 
and Oversight to consider alternative means 
for establishing commemorations, including 
the creation of an independent or Executive 
branch commission for such purpose, and to 
report to the House its recommendations 
thereon. 

Sec. 217. Numerical Designation of Amendments: 
Clause 6 of rule XXIII (‘‘Of Committees 
of the Whole’’) is amended to add a new 
sentence requiring that amendments submitted 
for printing in the amendments portion 
of the Congressional Record be given a numerical 
designation in the sequence submitted 
for a particular bill. 

The clause already requires that amendments 
printed in the Record be allowed five 
minutes of debate for and against, even if the 
Committee of the Whole has voted to close 
debate on a particular section or paragraph, 
and that time has expired. It is the purpose 
of this further amendment to the rule to facilitate 
reference to such amendments for 
the convenience of Members and committee 
managers alike, and to encourage Members 
to utilize the pre-printing option for their 
amendments. 

The new rule may also make it possible for 
the Committee on Rules to reference numerically 
designated amendments in special 
rules that structure the amendment process 
since the Congressional Record is often more 
readily available to Members and their staff 
than are Rules Committee reports. 

Sec. 218. Pledge of Allegiance: Clause 1 of 
rule XXIV (‘‘Order of Business’’) is amended 
to insert the Pledge of Allegiance as the 
third order of business each day in the 
House, following the approval of the Journal 
and preceding the correction of reference of 
public bills. This change codifies a practice 
in effect in the House since 1988. 

Sec. 219. Discharge Petitions: Clause 3 of 
rule XXVII (‘‘Change or Suspension of the 
Rules’’) is amended to require that the Clerk 
publish in the Congressional Record on the 
last day of House session each week the 
names of those Members who have signed a 
discharge motion during that week, and to 
make available on a daily basis, in an appropriate 
office, the cumulative lists of names 
of those Members who have signed pending 
discharge motions. Finally, the new rule directs 
the Clerk to devise a means for making 
such names on discharge petitions available 
to House offices and the public by electronic 
form. 


H 38 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 1995 

In the 103d Congress, the House adopted a 
new rule making the names of Members signing 
discharge petitions immediately available 
for public inspection. However, the rule 
change did not specify how such publication 
was to be accomplished. This rule change 
codifies the current practice of daily availability 
of all motions and signatures in a 
House office, and the weekly publication of 
new signatures in the Congressional Record. 
The directive regarding making such lists 
available by computer is in line with other 
ongoing initiatives to make House documents 
generally available to the public 
through computer networks. 

Sec. 220. Protection of Classified Materials: 
Rule XLIII (‘‘Code of Official Conduct’’) 
would be amended by adding a new clause 13 
requiring that any Member, officer or employee 
of the House take an oath or affirmation 
on non-disclosure of classified information 
prior to being given access to such materials. 
Copies of the executed oath would be 
retained by the Clerk of the House as part of 
the records of the House. 

Sec. 221. Select Committee on Intelligence: 
Subsection (a) amends clause 1(a) of rule 
XLVIII (‘‘Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence’’) to change the composition of 
the committee from 19 to 16 members, of 
whom not more than nine may be of the 
same political party. 

Subsection (b) amends clause 1(b) of rule 
XLVIII, to substitute the Speaker for the 
majority leader as a non-voting ex officio 
member of the committee, along with the 
minority leader. The subsection also allows 
both the Speaker and minority leader to designate 
one of their leadership staff to assist 
them in their roles as ex officio members of 
the committee, with all the same rights, 
privileges, and requirements as if members 
of the select committee staff. The purpose of 
this clause is to allow designated leadership 
staff the same access to committee documents 
and materials, briefings, hearings, and 
meetings, without having to become committee 
staff members for such access. A conforming 
changes is made by striking subparagraph 
(c)(3) of clause 7 which permits 
the Speaker to attend any select committee 

meeting and have access to any committee 
information. 

Subsection (c) amends clause 1 of rule 
XLVIII to extend from three (in any five consecutive 
Congresses) to four (in any six consecutive 
Congresses) the number of consecutive 
Congresses any Member (other than the 
Speaker and minority leader) may serve on 
the select committee, and to permit a chairman 
or ranking minority member who attain 
those positions in their fourth terms on the 
committee to serve in those positions for an 
additional term. 

Subsection (d) amends clause 2(a) of rule 
XLVIII to clarify the committee’s jurisdiction 
to reflect current referral practices. 

Sec. 222. Abolition of Legislative Service 
Organizations: This is a free-standing provision 
that prohibits in the 104th Congress the 
establishment or continuation of any legislative 
service organization (as the term is defined 
and authorized in the 103rd Congress). 
The Committee on House Oversight is authorized 
to take necessary steps to ensure 
the orderly termination and accounting for 
funds of any such LSO in existence on January 
3, 1995. So-called LSO’s are those organizations 
recognized through the House Administration 
Committee in the 103rd Congress 
which are allowed to utilize Member 
Clerk hire funds for the staffing of such special 
purpose organizations. It is the intent of 
this rule that the Committee on House Oversight 
will oversee the shut-down of such organizations 
in a manner to ensure the maximum 
accountability possible for any funds 
allocated for their operation. This is especially 
important in view of the comprehensive 
audit required by section 107 of the resolution. 


Sec. 223. Miscellaneous Provisions and 
Clerical Corrections: Subsection (a) amends 
clause 5(b)(1) of rule I (‘‘Duties of the Speaker’’) 
to expand the Speaker’s current authority 
to postpone votes on certain matters for 
up to two legislative days to include the previous 
question votes on adopting a resolution, 
passing a bill, instructing conferees, or 
agreeing to a conference report. At present, 
the only previous question vote the Speaker 

may postpone is on a privileged resolution 
from the Rules Committee. 

Subsection (b) establishes an Office for 
Legislative Floor Activities in the Office of 
the Speaker, and authorizes the Speaker to 
appoint and set the pay for floor assistants 
to assist him in managing legislative floor 
activity. 

Subsection (c) amends clause 2(d) of rule 
XI by allowing the chairman of a committee 
to designate any member of the committee, 
or of any subcommittee thereof, as vice 
chairman, to preside in the chairman’s absence. 
The present rule specifies that the 
ranking majority member shall serve as vice 
chairman. 

Subsection (d) amends clause 7 of rule XIV 
(‘‘Of Decorum and Debate’’) to include in 
those provisions of prohibited activities on 
the House floor the use of personal, electronic 
office equipment, including cellular 
phones and computers. It is the purpose of 
this new rule to avoid the disruptions and 
distractions that can be caused by the 
sounds emitted from such equipment. As 
with any disruption to the decorum of House 
floor debate, it is anticipated that the 
Speaker could instruct the Sergeant-at-Arms 
to take necessary steps to restore order. 

Subsection (e) amends clause 5(b) of rule 
XV (‘‘On Calls of the Roll and House’’) to 
permit the Speaker to reduce to five-minutes 
the vote that occurs following the vote on 
the previous question on any matter. The 
present rule confines this authority to the 
vote following the previous question vote 
only on a special rule from the Rules Committee. 


Subsection (f) makes clerical corrections 
in clause 3 of rule III, ‘‘Duties of the Clerk’’ 
by inserting ‘‘and’’ prior to the last in a series 
of clauses; and in clause 2(l)(1)(B) of rule 
XI by striking a reference to subdivision (C) 
that had been previously repealed. 

Subsection (g) is a free-standing provision 
that permits more than one prime sponsor 
on the first 20 bills and the first three joint 
resolutions introduced in the House in the 
104th Congress. This is done to permit the 
Leadership to designate multiple-authors of 
certain priority legislation.

CONGRESS, FIRST SESSION 

Vol. 141 WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 4, 1995 No. 1 

The fourth day of January being the 
day prescribed by House Concurrent 
Resolution 315 for the meeting of the 
lst session of the 104th Congress, the 
Senate assembled in its Chamber at the 
Capitol, at 12 noon. 

PRAYER 

The Chaplain, the Reverend Richard 

C. Halverson, D.D., offered the following 
prayer: 

Let us pray: 

In a moment of silence, let us re


member David Marcos, assistant executive 
clerk in the Secretary’s office, 
who lost his wife, Ann, last Thursday. 

For there is no power but of God: The 
powers that be are ordained of God.—Romans 
13:1. 

Eternal God, sovereign Lord of history, 
Governor of the nations, Your 
word is very clear. Authority comes 
from God, and authority is accountable 
to God. As the Senate opens the 104th 
Congress, engrave in the hearts and 
minds of Your servants this transcendent 
truth. Help them to live their 
lives and do their work profoundly 
aware of their God-ordained responsibility. 


Gracious God, grant to the Senators 
who are sworn in today a special sense 
of this profound fact, that they are 
here not simply because they sought 
the office or because the people elected 
them but that behind the whole process 
was the sovereign appointment of the 
Lord. 

Grant them grace to fulfill the purpose 
for which Thou hast placed them 
here. Be with their families as they 
make the adjustments to the tough 
schedules and the endless hours demanded 
of Senators. Grant to all who 
serve in the Senate the gifts of love 
and loyalty and patience. 

We pray in His name who is truth and 
love incarnate. Amen.

CALIFORNIA ELECTION CONTEST 

Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, prior to 
the Chair asking that the Senators-
elect present themselves to take their 
oath of office, I would like to address 
the Senate briefly on a petition submitted 
on behalf of Michael 
Huffington, who was a candidate for 

U.S. Senator from California. The petition 
contests the election of the Senator-
elect from California [Mrs. FEINSTEIN], 
asserting that there were irregularities 
and fraud in that election. 
The petition asks that if Senator FEINSTEIN 
is seated, as will occur, the seating 
be without prejudice to the ultimate 
determination of the election 
contest. 
Election petitions are submitted to 
the Senate pursuant to the Senate’s 
power, under article I, section 5, clause 
1 of the Constitution, to ‘‘be the judge 
of the elections, returns, and qualifications 
of its own members.’’ Under rule 
25 of the Standing Rules of the Senate, 
petitions concerning contested elections 
shall be referred to the Committee 
on Rules and Administration, and 
that shall be done with Mr. 
Huffington’s petition. It shall be the 
responsibility of the Rules Committee 
to determine what procedures should 
be followed in considering the merits of 
Mr. Huffington’s election contest, and 
whether a recommendation should be 
made to the Senate about its disposition. 


With respect to the swearing in that 
will follow, the petition asks that we 
consider at this time the narrower 
question whether the oath should be 
administered to Senator FEINSTEIN 
without prejudice to the election petition. 
At the convening of the 103d Congress, 
Senator Mitchell and I addressed 
the Senate on how that question has 
been viewed in previous election contests. 
In the course of our remarks, we 
particularly relied on the analysis of a 
predecessor of ours as majority leader, 
Senator Robert Taft of Ohio. Our full 
remarks, and a reprinting of remarks 
delivered by Senator Taft in 1953, are 
set forth in the RECORD for January 5, 
1993. I shall not repeat all that has been 
said previously, but the essential point 
is as follows. 

The oath that will be administered to 
Senator FEINSTEIN, just as the oath 
that will be administered to all other 
Senators-elect, will be without prejudice 
to the Senate’s constitutional 
power to be the judge of the election of 
its members. In the words of Senator 
Taft in 1953, 

If a Senator takes the oath, I do not believe 
that the fact changes the basis of the 
vote, or the percentage of the vote required, 
which is determined by the character of the 
case, rather than by anything done at the 
time the oath is administered. 

As I stated to the Senate 2 years ago, 
‘‘In effect we are all sworn in ‘without 
prejudice.’ ’’ 

Just as the Senate retains its full 
power to judge the election in California 
and all other Senate elections, the 
pendency of an election contest does 
not diminish the effect of the oath that 
will now be administered. As I also expressed 
to the Senate at the opening of 
the last Congress, ‘‘All Senators sworn 
in today are Senators in every sense of 
the word.’’ 

Nevertheless, as Senator Mitchell 
told the Senate 2 years ago, the making 
of this statement prior to the 
swearing in of a challenge Senator-
elect serves the purpose of acknowledging 
formally that the Senate has received 
an election petition and that it 
will review the petition in accordance 
with its customary procedures. 

f 


SWEARING IN OF SENATORS 

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I 
would like to state my concurrence 
with the basic proposition stated today 
that the administration of the oath to 
Senator-elect FEINSTEIN will not prejudice 
in any way the Senate’s constitutional 
power to judge the California 
election. Neither will the pendency of 
Mr. Huffington’s petition diminish in 
any way the effect of the oath that will

ELECTING C. ABBOTT SAFFOLD AS 

THE SECRETARY FOR THE MI


NORITY 

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I send 
a resolution to the desk and ask for its 
immediate consideration. 

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will report. 

The legislative clerk read as follows:. 

A resolution (S. Res. 10) electing C. Abbott 
Saffold as the Secretary for the Minority of 
the Senate. 

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, with 
great pleasure I announce the selection 
of Ms. Abby Saffold as Secretary for 
the Minority. 

There could not be a better or more 
qualified person for this position. It is 
a position that demands patience, wisdom, 
and instinct, as well as dedication 
and an incredibly high degree of competence. 
It demands the ability to work 
and to look after the interests of 47 of 
the most demanding people in the 
country. And it demands a deep and 
broad knowledge of the workings of the 

U.S. Congress. 
Ms. Saffold meets these requirements 
and more. As former Senate Majority 
Leader George Mitchell stated, ‘‘to 
know Abby is a pleasure. To work with 
her is a delight.’’ 

Ms. Saffold is a congressional veteran. 
On the House side, she worked for 
Representatives William Scott and 
Lloyd Meeds. On the Senate side, she 
has worked for Senate giants, including 
Gaylord Nelson, Birch Bayh, ROBERT 
C. BYRD, and George Mitchell. She 
has served on important Senate com-

the floor staff for the Senate Democratic 
Policy Committee. 

In April, 1987, Ms. Saffold became the 
first woman of either party to serve as 
Secretary for the Majority. 

In this position, she demonstrated 
that she is highly skilled as a legislative 
strategist, highly adept in running 
the Cloakroom, and highly talented in 
helping Senators do their best in a system 
that sometimes is troubling and 
too often frustrating. Ms. Saffold is all 
that a party leader could ask for in 
this demanding position—and more. 

I have read of the time when Senate 
Majority Leader Howard Baker held up 
a Senate debate while Ms. Saffold completed 
negotiating the legislative timetable 
with his staff. The Republican 
majority leader, for the RECORD, explained: 
‘‘We’re just here waiting for 
Abby.’’ 

Mr. President, I have no doubt that, 
as the Democratic leader, I will be even 
more dependent on Ms. Saffold. I am 
delighted to have her serving as Secretary 
to the Minority. 

I thank my colleagues for electing 
Ms. Saffold to the position, and I thank 
Ms. Saffold for accepting it. 

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without 
objection, the resolution is agreed 
to. 

The resolution (S. Res. 10) reads as 
follows: 

Resolved, That C. Abbott Saffold be and she 
is hereby elected Secretary for the Minority 
of the Senate, beginning January 4, 1995.

SALUTE TO STROM THURMOND 

Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the Framers 
of the Constitution in 1787 set down 
only a handful of rules to govern the 
procedures of Congress. Among them 
was a provision stating that the Senate 
could choose its own officers, including 
a President pro tempore, who would 
preside in the absence of the Vice 
President. 

And as we begin a new session of Congress, 
we also begin another chapter in 
the remarkable life of the colleague 
who returns today to the position of 
President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, 
Senator STROM THURMOND. 

Senator THURMOND’s public service 
career is well known. While some have 
suggested that he actually attended 
the Constitutional Convention in 1787, 
Senator THURMOND’s political career 
actually began 62 short years ago, 
when he was elected to the South Carolina 
State senate. 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 11 

Six years in the State senate, 4 years A resolution (S. Res. 21) to amend Senate since and all that happened during 

as a judge, 4 years in the military, 
where he piloted a glider behind enemy 
lines on D-day, 4 years as Governor of 
South Carolina, and 40 years in the 

U.S. Senate, add up to nearly 60 years 
of service. 
The hallmark of Senator THURMOND’S 
career is much more than just longevity. 
It is also effectiveness. As the Almanac 
of American Politics’’ states, 
Senator THURMOND decides where he 
wants to go, figures out how to get 
there, and then does it. 

As chairman or ranking member of 
the Judiciary Committee for a dozen 
years, Senator THURMOND saw the need 
for a war against crime and drugs long 
before other politicians jumped on 
board. 

And as the new chairman of the 
Armed Services Committee, Senator 
THURMOND will continue his lifelong 
commitment to keeping America 
strong. 

On behalf of all Republican Senators, 
I want to express to Senator THURMOND 
our admiration and respect, and tell 
him how delighted we are to have him 
once again serving as President pro 
tempore. 

f 


SALUTE TO SHIRLEY FELIX 

Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as Members 
of this Chamber know, the Senate 
lost a devoted employee and many of 
us lost a cherished friend when Shirley 
Felix passed away on December 13, 
1994. 

As banquet manager for the U.S. Senate 
for the last 20 years, Shirley 
worked closely with the leadership offices, 
and with the offices of almost 
every Senator. 

Once you began working with Shirley, 
it did not take you long to realize 
that she was a true professional. She 
knew how to get the job done right, 
and she did it with a friendly and caring 
attitude. 

Shirley’s hours were often long, and 
the pressures of organizing important 
events were often great, but Shirley 
somehow never seemed to lose her good 
humor. 

Just as Shirley was loved on Capitol 
Hill, she was also loved by her family. 
I know I speak for all Members of the 
Senate in extending our sympathies to 
her husband, James; her mother, Mrs. 
Rebecca Plummer; her 6 sons, her 12 
grandchildren, and her many other 
family members and friends. 

Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from North Carolina.

TO AMEND SENATE RESOLUTION

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send a

The legislative clerk read as follows: 

Resolution 338 (which establishes the Select 
Committee on Ethics) to change the membership 
of the select committee from members 
of the Senate to private citizens. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the immediate consideration 
of the resolution? 

Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I object. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 
objection. 

Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from North Carolina.

ORDER OF PROCEDURE 

Mr. HELMS. I now ask unanimous 
consent that it be in order for me to 
send seven bills to the desk and that 
they be deemed to have been read the 
first time, and that my request for the 
second reading be deemed to have been 
objected to. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. HELMS. I send the documents to 
the desk as stated. 

One final thing, Mr. President. I send 
to the desk statements to accompany 
all eight pieces of legislation and ask 
that they appear in the RECORD in the 
appropriate place. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

(The remarks of Mr. HELMS pertaining 
to the introduction of legislation 
are located in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 

Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I 
thank the distinguished majority leader. 
I am happy to call him that. 

I suggest the absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator withhold? 


Mr. HELMS. Yes. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority 
leader is recognized.

CONGRATULATIONS TO SPEAKER 

OF THE HOUSE GINGRICH AND 

OTHERS 

Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me say 
first of all that having served in the 
House for 8 years, in the other body for 
8 years, a long time ago, I have just 
come from the House floor where I 
have had the privilege of seeing something 
that I did not think might ever 
happen, where we have a Republican 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 


I say to my Democratic friends as 
well that I think after 40 years, everybody 
would be fairly happy. We waited 
a long, long time. So I wish to congratulate 
Speaker GINGRICH and Minority 
Leader GEPHARDT and the others on 
the House side who have tremendous 
responsibilities as we begin the 104th 
Congress. 

But I must say that as I sat there and 
thought about the days I was there in 
the sixties, in 1961 through 1968, and 
thought about all that has happened 

those 8 years, even the fact that, in the 
Senate, it probably does not create the 
excitement—even within this Sen-
ator—that we feel for the House after 
all of those years. 

So I salute my colleagues in the 
House and I wish them every success. 

f 


CONGRATULATIONS TO SENATOR 
DASCHLE 

Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I also wish 
to congratulate Senator DASCHLE, the 
Democratic leader. I have said many 
times if we are going to make this 
place work, as the American people expect 
us to make this place work, knowing 
that sometimes there will be differences, 
sometimes politics will creep 
in—politics is highly competitive and 
should be—but it should be based on 
ideas and what may be best for the 
country. 

But for the Senate to operate, leaders 
have to work together. I look forward 
to working with Senator DASCHLE. We 
have known each other for a long time. 
We are from the same part of the country, 
I from Kansas and he from South 
Dakota. And we have many things in 
common. Our relationship has to be 
based on trust. There cannot be any 
surprises. The majority leader has the 
advantage because he has priority of 
recognition. I will not permit any surprises, 
and Senator DASCHLE has indicated 
the same. 

I had such relationships with Senator 
MITCHELL and Senator BYRD. In fact, I 
talked to Senator MITCHELL this morning 
about 11:10 a.m. I said: ‘‘George, 
you have 50 minutes left. Is there anything 
you want me to do?’’ We were 
good friends and we worked well together, 
as I did with Senator BYRD. 

I learned a lot from Senator BYRD. I 
decided a long time ago never to argue 
about the rules with Senator BYRD, because 
you will lose. He wrote most of 
them, and he defined others; he has 
modified others. In fact, I asked him a 
question this morning. I said, ‘‘Robert, 
it is not necessary when you send an 
amendment to the desk to ask for its 
immediate consideration, is it?’’ He 
said, ‘‘No, you just send an amendment 
to the desk.’’ I thought I knew that. 
But I wanted to make certain that I 
understood it. Again, Senator BYRD 
provided that information. I am certain 
Senator DASCHLE will continue 
that tradition. 

f 


CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NEW 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS 

Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I also want 
to congratulate the 11 new Republican 
Senators who were elected in November. 
I thank them and all my Republican 
colleagues for their support in 
electing me as Senate majority leader. 

But even more importantly, on behalf 
of all of us elected to serve, I 
thank the American people for their 
trust and their calling us to task. 


S 12 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

America has reconnected us with the 
hopes for a nation made more free by 
demanding a Government that is more 
limited. Reining in our Government 
will be my mandate, and I hope it will 
be the purpose and principal accomplishment 
of the 104th Congress. 

It was nearly 206 years ago when the 
First Congress met in New York City. 
Much of their work was devoted to 
writing the Bill of Rights—the first 10 
amendments to our Constitution. 

The 10th of those amendments reads: 
‘‘The powers not delegated to the United 
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited 
by it to the States, are reserved 
to the States, respectively, or to the 
people.’’ 

I might say I think we need to focus 
on the 10th amendment. So I intend to 
place it in the RECORD at least once a 
week with a brief statement so that 
anybody who reads the RECORD, anybody 
watching C-SPAN, or my colleagues, 
may understand the importance 
of the 10th amendment and how 
far we have strayed from it. 

Federalism is an idea that power 
should be kept close to the people. It is 
the idea on which our Nation was 
founded. But there are some in Washington—
perhaps fewer this year than 
last—who believe that neither our 
States nor our people can be trusted 
with power. Federalism has given way 
to paternalism—with disastrous results. 


If I have one goal for the 104th Congress, 
it is this: That we will dust off 
the 10th amendment and restore it to 
its rightful place in the Constitution. 

Senate bill No. 1 will be step number 

1: Legislation to end unasked for and 
unfunded Federal mandates on States 
and cities and communities across 
America. And I am honored the Presiding 
Officer at this moment is Senator 
KEMPTHORNE from Idaho and former 
mayor of Boise, ID, who has been leading 
the effort since day one, since his 
first day on the Senate floor, working 
with Governors, our colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle, our colleagues in the 
House, mayors, and county commissioners 
all across America, because we 
know what Federal mandates—and he 
knows better than most, coming here 
as a mayor—have cost our cities and 
how they have bankrupted our cities 
and States. 
So, along with many other Senators, 
Senator KEMPTHORNE has done yeoman’s 
work in preparing this legislation. 


We are going to have hearings tomorrow. 
We are serious about this. We 
promised the American people if they 
gave us the majority we will do certain 
things, and we are about to do certain 
things that we think are right—not 
necessarily partisan, but right. We 
hope to bring these things to the floor 
very soon. 

I spoke this morning with the Senator 
from Idaho, and he will be prepared, 
I hope, early next week. 

We wish to demonstrate quickly, 
whatever the message may have been 

on November 8, 1994—and there were a 
lot of messages—I think one message 
was to take a look at the 10th amendment. 
Maybe people did not think 
about it when they voted. But give 
America back to the people, give it 
back to the States, give it back to the 
local communities. What is wrong with 
that? 

We do not have all of the answers in 
Washington, DC. Why should we tell 
Idaho, or the State of Kansas, or the 
State of South Dakota, or the State of 
Oregon, or any other State, that we are 
going to pass this Federal law and we 
are going to require that you do certain 
things, but we are not going to 
send you any money. So you raise the 
taxes in the local communities or in 
the States. You tax the people, and 
when they complain about it, say, well, 
we cannot help it because the Federal 
Government passed this mandate. So 
we are going to continue our drive to 
return power to our States and our people 
throughout the 104th Congress. 

We will roll back Federal programs, 
laws, and regulations from A to Z, from 
Amtrak to zoological studies, working 
our way through the alphabet soup of 
Government. What will be our guide? 
Our guide is going to be simply this: Is 
this program a basic function of a limited 
Government? Or is it another example 
of how Government has lost 
faith in the judgments of our people 
and the potential of our markets? That 
is the test. 

I believe that more often than not 
the answer will justify less Federal involvement, 
fewer Federal rules and 
regulations, a reduction in Federal 
spending, and more freedom and opportunity 
for our States and our citizens— 
again getting back to the 10th amendment. 


Part of what has allowed Government 
to become so cavalier with power 
has been its ability to exclude itself 
from the dictates we impose on the 
American people—we, the Congress. So 
what are we going to do? This is going 
to be bill No. 2. This will end with the 
passage of Senate bill No. 2, an effort 
led by Senator GRASSLEY, a Republican, 
and Senator LIEBERMAN, a Democrat. 
We have a counterpart led by Republicans 
and Democrats in the House, 
particularly Congressman SHAYS from 
Connecticut. I can think of no better 
protection for the private citizens and 
private enterprise than the constant 
prospect for Members of Congress that 
we will have to live under the rules we 
inflict on everyone else. So if a law is 
going to apply to some small businessman 
in Idaho, Oregon, Kansas, North 
Carolina, wherever, it is also going to 
apply to Congress. Maybe when it applies 
to Congress, we will understand 
why so many people write and complain 
to us about this law or that law. 
Do not misunderstand me, some laws 
we pass are certainly beneficial. The 
Government does a lot of good things, 
so do not misunderstand me. But why 
should we not live under the same laws 
you live under? That is bill No. 2. 

In the same spirit, we are also going 
to propose and pass legislation to protect 
the rights of private property owners, 
and to cut the tangle of red tape 
forced upon our small businessmen and 
women. Property rights. Again, it was 
initiated by the Senator from Idaho, 
Senator Symms, who served here with 
distinction for years; it was his idea. 
When Steve Symms left the Senate 
voluntarily, he passed it on to me, and 
I have worked with my colleagues, Senator 
GRAMM and others, on this side of 
the aisle and, again, the Presiding Officer, 
the Senator from Idaho, and a 
number of others, and we believe in it. 
It is important in urban and rural 
areas all across America. 

Incidentally, it was said by someone 
who should know better last year that 
America’s small businessmen and 
women were getting a free ride from 
American society. That statement was 
not made by a politician, so do not 
read anything into it. It was somebody 
that should have known better. Let me 
set the record straight. The engine of 
American society is America’s small 
business. Small business provides the 
jobs, the competition, and the spark 
for progress that is the very essence of 
democratic capitalism. It is small business 
that carries America—not the 
other way around. 

Mr. President, Republicans also believe 
that our country’s increasingly 
desperate fight against crime is an area 
where more freedom is needed at the 
State level. 

Today we will introduce, under Senator 
HATCH’s leadership, Senate bill 3, 
a crime bill that will free States and 
cities to decide for themselves how to 
spend much of the $8 billion in law enforcement 
funds appropriated last year. 
It will eliminate the wasteful social 
spending programs included in last 
year’s so-called crime bill. 

Perhaps most important, the crime 
bill we introduce today will begin our 
effort to restore the freedom from fear 
we knew in the America of our youth. 
In my hometown of Russell, KS, when 
I was growing up, we did not lock our 
doors at night. Nobody did. You left 
your keys in your car. Even in towns 
the size of mine in this day and age you 
do not do that anymore. So somehow 
that has been lost to the children growing 
up in America today. We will, without 
apology, remove from society those 
who are tearing it apart with casual violence 
and a new chilling disregard for 
human life. Our crime bill will impose 
mandatory minimum sentences on 
those who use guns in the commission 
of a crime and make certain there are 
jails there to lock them up. 

And in the next session we will cut 
taxes. Under Senator PACKWOOD’s leadership, 
the Finance Committee will 
produce, as a top priority, a tax cut 
that will let families keep more of 
their own money to invest in their own 
children and in their own future, instead 
of siphoning it up, giving it to 
Washington, and sending it back in 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 13 

some program that may or may not 
work. 

There seems to be a growing bipartisan 
consensus that taxes must be cut, 
which Republicans welcome, and which 
encourages me to believe the Senate 
can act quickly. The President’s recent 
comments indicate he is ready to sign 
such a bill. But I strongly object to the 
President’s insistence on labeling 
America by ‘‘class.’’ I do not think we 
ought to divide Americans into economic 
groups competing one against 
the other for the favors of the Government. 
Rather, we must lead by instilling 
hope and restoring freedom and opportunity 
for all of our people. No more 
of the class warfare. It does not work. 

By cutting people’s taxes we will reduce 
the Government’s take of their 
wages—worthy unto itself. But if tax 
cuts are to have the effect of limiting 
Government and providing for longterm 
prosperity, then they also must 
be matched by real cuts, real cuts in 
Government spending. 

This, Republicans are committed to 
do. 

No one in this Chamber has spoken 
more eloquently about the need to deal 
more forthrightly with our national 
deficit than Senator DOMENICI, who 
today assumes the chair of the Budget 
Committee. 

Let me be clear. Something like a 
family that examines its budget after a 
Christmas that was too rich, we will 
make hard decisions and endure sacrifices 
to make ends meet. With the 
one exception of Social Security, every 
bureaucracy and bureaucrat, every 
Government program and Federal expense 
is ripe for reduction and/or elimination. 


At the top of that list is a price tag 
for Congress itself. We have to set an 
example before we have somebody else 
make the sacrifice. We must be the example, 
not the problem. We hope to 
pass a resolution today calling upon 
the Rules Committee to reduce committee 
budgets by approximately $34 
million. That is a lot of money. That 
was objected to, but we will get to it in 
another way. The House is also taking 
cost-cutting action today. We will 
work together throughout the next 2 
years to save more money across Government. 


We will also work together to pass 
the line-item veto legislation which we 
introduce today as Senate bill 4, and to 
send a balanced budget amendment to 
the States for ratification. These measures 
which have had the overwhelming 
support of the American people for 
some time have been ignored in Washington 
for far too long. 

These measures go to the heart of the 
question with which we began: Should 
Government elites rule society? Should 
they be able to spend the people’s 
money without check, cloaked by impenetrable 
rules and omnibus appropriations 
bills too massive for anybody 
to read? Or should we trust the people? 

Paternalism or Federalism? That is 
the choice. The 104th Congress must 
answer that question by bowing to the 
will of the people and putting its trust 
in them. 

Finally, let me make it clear that 
Republicans are acutely aware that the 
United States has only one Commander 
in Chief. Our Commander in Chief is 
President Clinton. We will support him 
on foreign policy whenever possible, as 
we did with NAFTA and GATT legislation, 
and in revising outdated provisions 
of law on South Africa, Russia, 
and the Middle East. 

During the last few years, however, 
there have been some important areas 
of disagreement between Congress and 
the President in the area of foreign policy. 
One of these has been the President’s 
apparent willingness to place 
the agenda of the United Nations before 
the interests of the United States. 

Therefore, we will introduce today 
the Peace Powers Act of 1995, which is 
designated as Senate bill No. 5. This 
legislation repeals the War Powers Resolution 
of 1973 and places some restrictions 
on U.S. participation in U.N. 
peacekeeping activities. The effect of 
the bill would be this: We would untie 
the President’s hands in using American 
forces to defend American interests, 
but we would restrict the use of 
American forces and funds in U.N. 
peacekeeping. 

We do not want American soldiers 
under U.N. command, and the costs to 
America of U.N. peacekeeping must be 
known before—not after, but before—it 
will be approved by Congress. 

In a manner consistent with our constitutional 
role to appropriate funds 
and to advise and consent on matters 
of foreign policy, the Senate will also 
take a close look at a number of other 
foreign policy issues in this session; including 
the costs of the Haiti operation, 
and the legality and wisdom of 
aiding North Korea. 

Mr. President, it has been said that 
we have become a nation of competing 
factions, held together less by our 
hopes than by our wants. The implication 
is that we are no longer a great 
people, but merely a continent of categories, 
and special interests. Well, I 
do not believe this. I have been here for 
some time, but I do not believe this. 

It has been said that Government is 
uncontrollable because of the uncontrollable 
appetites of our people. Last 
November was proof that this is not 
true. If the recent election proved anything—
and some would question, some 
have doubts, and some have different 
views—it proved these ideas to be the 
self-justification of a Government 
grown too cynical, too fat, and too far 
removed from the people it is supposed 
to serve. 

Mr. President, Americans have been 
voting in congressional elections for 
more than 200 years. Some of these 
elections—most of these elections— 
made very little difference. But others 

have been turning points in history. 
The last one was a turning point. 

The elections in November provided 
clear instruction from the American 
people. The ideas on which we will conduct 
the business of Government were 
laid out in unprecedented detail during 
the last election campaign. This was 
derided as a strategy by political pundits 
and attacked as heresy by the established 
powers. But the ideas prevailed. 
And therefore, I believe the 
ideas will prevail in this body and in 
the House and across the sprawling expanse 
of Government. 

Mr. President, Republicans welcome 
the support of like-thinking Democrats 
as we work to put a leash on our Government 
by restoring the 10th amendment, 
cutting taxes, balancing the 
budget, enacting term limits, and taking 
whatever other measures are necessary 
to make the Government accountable 
to the voters. 

Together, we hope to establish once 
again America’s trust in her people and 
faith in the unmatched power of freedom 
to build a world of hope and opportunity 
for all. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that Senate bills 1 through 5 be 
printed in the RECORD, along with written 
statements which further detail 
these bills. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

(The text of the bills and statements 
are located in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 

Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority 
leader. 

Mr. DOLE. I thank the Chair.

LIEBERMAN, and Mr. FEINGOLD, pertaining 
to the introduction of S. 21 are located

on Introduced Bills and Joint 
Resolutions.’’)

COMMENDING THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me 
commend the majority leader on his 
statement and on many of the points 
that he raised in the last few minutes. 

Let me also personally thank him for 
his cooperation and the manner with 
which he has worked with the Members 
in our caucus over the last several 
weeks. 

Needless to say, this transition has 
not been easy, but, to the extent possible, 
the majority leader has made it 
so. I thank him for his cordiality, for 
his friendship, and for the manner in 
which he has conducted his office in 
the last several weeks. It means a good 
deal to me. I look forward to working 
with him in the many months and 
years ahead. 


S 14 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE IN THE 

104TH CONGRESS 

THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD 

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, with 
the opening of the 104th Congress, we 
again witness a historic transfer of 
power as the Republican Party takes 
control of the Senate and Senator 
STROM THURMOND earlier today replaced 
Senator ROBERT C. BYRD as 
President pro tempore of the Senate. In 
this transition, we are witnessing one 
Senate institution replacing another. 

Together, these two outstanding legislators 
total three quarters of a century 
service in the Senate. Each not 
only has witnessed, but participated in, 
so much history and in the enactment 
of so much legislation, that Senators of 
my generation often are left in awe. As 
we prepare our legislative agendas and 
prepare for the upcoming debates and 
battles, this historic transition should 
not be lost upon us. 

Senator BYRD, for the past 6 years, 
has presided over the deliberations of 
the Senate. 

A look at the record reveals that he 
is indeed an institution within this institution. 
The senior Senator from 
West Virginia has served in the Senate 
for nearly 40 years. He has served as 
chairman of Senate Appropriations 
Committee, as the Senate Democratic 
whip, 6 years as Senate minority leader, 
6 years as Senate majority leader, 
and, since 1987, President pro tempore 
of the Senate. 

His unparalleled knowledge of the 
Senate’s intricate rules and procedures, 
his overwhelming knowledge of 
the history of this legislative body that 
he loves so deeply, and, his presence in 
this Chamber combined to make him a 
most effective and impressive President 
pro tempore. 

What an honor it has been for me 
personally to watch him preside. We 
will miss him and his presence in the 
chair. While there is not a stronger, 
more ardent fighter for the causes in 
which he believes and supports, no one 
could have been more fair or more impartial 
in presiding over the Senate. 

Although he leaves the chair of 
President pro tempore, I can assure 
you he is not about to fade away. As 
the new Democratic leader of the Senate, 
I will need, I will seek, and I will 
certainly appreciate his wisdom, experience, 
his insight, and his foresight. I 
know that Senators from both sides of 
the aisle will continue to value the 
benefit of his unique perspective and 
the importance of this institution as 
well as his unique ability to resolve 
problems within it. 

Mr. President, at the closing of the 
99th Congress, the Senate approved a 
resolution recognizing the outstanding 
service Senator STROM THURMOND had 
performed as President pro tempore of 
the Senate. The resolution expressed 
the Senate’s appreciation for the courteous, 
dignified, and impartial manner 
in which the senior Senator from 
South Carolina had presided over the 
deliberations of the Senate. 

In the 104th Congress, Senator THURMOND 
again will occupy this important 
and prestigious position. Like Senator 
BYRD, he, too, is an institution within 
this institution. While a Member of the 
Senate, he has been a member of both 
political parties and a candidate for 
President of another. While serving in 
the U.S. Senate, Senator THURMOND 
has had highways, courthouses, Federal 
buildings, and schools named in 
his honor—honors usually reserved for 
those who are no longer with us. In the 
Senate, he has been an active participant—
sometimes controversial—but a 
participant in the legislative struggles 
of our times. I have not always agreed 
with his positions, past or present, in 
those contests, but I have never seen or 
encountered a more worthy, a more 
dignified opponent or one for whom I 
have greater respect. 

As everyone who has had the pleasure 
of serving in this Chamber with 
him knows, Senator THURMOND has 
been a consistent champion of the 
South and of conservative causes, but 
we also know he has been able to blend 
and bend when democracy took a different 
course. He has remained a southern 
gentleman of the highest order. 

As the Democratic leader, I want to 
extend my congratulations to Senator 
THURMOND for his reelection as President 
pro tempore and welcome him 
back to this position. I look forward to 
working with him as well. I am confident 
that in the 104th Congress, Senator 
THURMOND will perform the duties 
of President pro tempore of the Senate 
in the same courteous, dignified, and 
impartial manner in which he presided 
over the deliberations of the Senate in 
the 99th Congress. 

f 


THE 104TH CONGRESS 

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today 
we begin a new session of Congress. I 
know all my colleagues are eager to 
move ahead with the Nation’s business. 

In some ways, we face circumstances 
that earlier generations of Americans 
faced as well. At the beginning of our 
Nation’s existence, after the Declaration 
of Independence was signed, the 
former colonies busied themselves establishing 
legislatures and drafting 
constitutions. 

It must have been a heady time. Men, 
for they were all men at that time, who 
had been colonial appointees began to 
see themselves for the first time as legislators, 
potential leaders, people who 
could steer their States’ destinies. 

In the State of Pennsylvania, the legislature 
spent several months thrashing 
over the outlines of a new constitution 
but found itself, months later, 
without a finished product. 

Meanwhile, the life of the State continued. 
Citizens woke each morning, 
attended to their affairs, transacted 
their business, and seemed not to notice 
that they were without a constitution. 


Ben Franklin pointed out the evident 
danger: ‘‘Gentleman,’’ he said, ‘‘You 

see that we have been living under anarchy, 
yet the business of living has 
gone on as usual. Be careful; if our debates 
go on much longer, people may 
come to see that they can get along 
very well without us.’’ 

It is somewhat in this spirit that I 
approach the beginning of the 104th 
Congress. We, too, will be judged less 
by our rhetoric than by our accomplishments. 


Today, I offer the first five bills that 
my Democratic colleagues and I will 
seek to move in this Congress. They 
are bills that speak to three critical 
areas I believe should be the focus of 
our efforts in the 104th Congress—economic 
opportunities for working American 
families, the values in our social 
fabric that bind us together as a society, 
and a determination that we end 
business as usual in all aspects of Government. 


The first bill, S. 6, is designed to be 
for American workers today what the 
GI bill was for American soldiers after 
the Second World War. The Working 
Americans Opportunity Act takes the 
funds now used for 20 major job training 
programs and turns them into 
vouchers so Americans can buy the 
training and education they need 
themselves. In this way, we can 
streamline and consolidate nine job 
training laws to focus more services 
and to redirect the funds to the people 
who need the training in the first 
place. 

Our limited job-training resources 
should be directed to those who will 
benefit from training, not siphoned off 
to support the administrative costs of 
overlapping, fragmented, and outdated 
programs. 

The GI bill is rightly credited with 
lifting American productivity, economic 
growth, and living standards. It 
did that by giving all returning GI’s— 
millions of men and women in the aggregate—
the ability to go back to 
school and make up for the years they 
sacrificed to their Nation’s service in 
war. 

It was not only well-deserved reward 
for veterans. It was one of the best investments 
the Government ever made. 
The GI bill more than repaid its costs 
many times over in worker income, in 
productivity, in economic growth, in 
State and Federal taxes, in virtually 
every other way. 

At the end of the cold war years, 
we’re not facing an army of returning 
veterans. We are facing a society that 
is emerging from a preoccupation with 
military spending and the military 
sciences, and turning to cope with a 
new world of technological advance 
that holds enormous promise for those 
who can learn to participate in it. 

Our bill, therefore, will consolidate 
old job training programs and put 
money directly into the hands of those 
who need training, not to bureaucratic 
overhead. Americans need the tools to 
enter fully into the new technological 
workplace. That is what our first bill 
will do. It will be a workers’ GI bill to 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 15 

give those in older industries, in plants 
that are relocating abroad, or in regions 
where people’s job skills do not 
match employers’ needs the chance to 
learn new skills, make themselves employable, 
enter new industries, and 
move forward with our growing economy. 


S. 7 is the Family Health Insurance 
Protection Act. It includes the measures 
that even the anti-health-care-reform 
crowd last year said they wanted. 
Let us find out if they are being 
straight or are just pulling another one 
over on the American people. 
Democrats think it is way past time 
to act. Not only are health care costs 
for ordinary people going through the 
roof, they are also going to bust the 
Federal budget, and we all know who’s 
going to pay for that when it happens. 

It is consistent with the goals outlined 
in bills introduced by both Republicans 
and Democrats and with the 
vision the President outlined in a latter 
to the congressional leadership last 
week. 

Our health reform bill is straightforward 
and sensible. 

It prevents insurance companies from 
raising rates because you get sick. 
Why? Because health insurance is supposed 
to be a pooled risk. The insurer, 
as well as the insured, takes a risk. 

Our bill also prohibits refusal of insurance 
because of preexisting conditions. 
The condition of being human 
makes us all susceptible to illness, accidents, 
and bad luck. That is what insurance 
is supposed to compensate for, 
not to profit from. 

Jean and Greg Puls of Sioux Falls, 
SD, know this all too well. Their 10year-
old son, Matthew, has diabetes. 
When Jean’s employer switched health 
policies, the new insurer refused to 
cover Matthew. Jean and Greg faced a 
frantic search for an insurer who 
would. 

They were turned down by dozens of 
companies and were finally forced to 
purchase an out-of-State policy that 
still won’t cover Matthews’s diabetes 
for a whole year. 

Jean Puls says that for all the money 
they have paid into the health care 
system, they have been unable to get 
the simple peace of mind they seek. 
And she is right. A system which produces 
this result is not right 

Our bill requires all insurers to offer 
Americans one plan of insurance coverage 
as good as that which covers any 
Member of Congress—Democrat or Republican. 


If we deserve it, then certainly so do 
the people whose tax dollars pay our 
wages. 

Our bill lets people who are self-employed 
deduct their insurance premium 
costs just like big corporations can. 
That is the minimally fair thing we 
can do for American farmers and self-
employed store owners, accountants, 
mechanics, and lawn-service operators, 
all the millions of people who have 
taken the real risk of earning their 
own income by their own hard work 

and enterprise. Let them deduct their 
health insurance costs, too. 

Our health reform bill prohibits insurance 
companies from hiding important 
information in the fine print. We 
need truth in labeling. People who 
market beef have to tell consumers 
how many grams of fat their product 
contains. It is about time the insurance 
companies told us what their fat 
content is. Why should not Americans 
get the same accountability from 
health insurers as we expect from food 
producers and toy manufacturers? 

Our health reform bill calls for standard 
forms. An inflamed appendix taken 
out in Seattle doesn’t demand anything 
different than an inflamed appendix 
removed in Boston. 

And it will not be done better or 
worse because of the shape of a payment 
form. Meanwhile, we are talking 
about millions of wasted hours by doctors, 
nurses, administrative staff, and, 
not least, the American taxpayer just 
to get reimbursed for the health care 
our premiums are supposed to cover. 

Our health care reform bill just asks 
the private insurance market to do 
what Government is trying to do. Let 
it get rid of the bloated bureaucrats. 
Let it cut the overhead. Let it streamline 
and serve its customers, not itself. 

Is there any reason that Americans 
have to fill out more forms, provide duplicative 
information more times, fight 
for longer on the phone with self-appointed 
bureaucrats in the health insurance 
industry than the people of 
any other industrialized nation? Is 
there any reason that an American 
hospital has twice as many clerical 
workers as a Canadian one? Does pushing 
paper make sick people get better? 
Let health care professionals practice 
medicine, not administer bookkeepers. 

This bill represents, frankly, a down-
payment on the goal of ensuring all 
Americans have access to affordable 
quality health care coverage. 

Before we achieve that goal, however, 
other more difficult issues will have to 
be resolved, especially long-term care 
and the Federal barriers to State-level 
reform efforts. The bill we offer is simply 
a first step, but I do hope that 
Democrats and Republicans can again 
reflect the consensus these provisions 
have reflected in the last Congress and 
work together to develop compromises 
on the more difficult matters. 

I cannot—I will not—support the passage 
of any reform measure, however, 
that increases the deficit. 

When the majority leader and my 
colleagues on the Finance Committee 
are ready to move forward on the 
health reforms we present today, we 
will have to agree on appropriate offsetting 
savings to ensure that every reform 
provision is paid for over a 10year 
period of time. Health care reform 
cannot be undertaken at the cost of 
more unpaid bills passed along to our 
children and to their children. 

Our third bill, S. 8, is legislation to 
deal with teen pregnancy and parents 
who abandon their children. Our bill 

does not finance orphanages. One of 
our Democratic colleagues, Senator 
CAMPBELL of Colorado, has the distinction 
of actually having been placed in 
an orphanage as a child, so he speaks 
from experience, not dealing in Hollywood 
movies. His story is one which 
could benefit us all. If you have not 
had the opportunity to read his biography, 
I would encourage you, Mr. 
President, and others to do so. It is a 
telling story of a man who has come a 
long way, given the very difficult beginning 
that he had experienced as a 
child. 

He learned, as many of us now know, 
that orphanages are not a home. All 
too often, they are not even a decent 
substitute for a home. Even the best 
orphanage should never be used to undermine 
an intact family relationship. 

The Teen Pregnancy Prevention and 
Parental Responsibility Act, instead, 
requires underaged teen mothers to 
live with their families or at least find 
themselves in a supervised home setting 
if they want to qualify for AFDC. 
Children having children is tragic, and 
the cycle can only be ended by making 
sure that parents of these children 
grow up and become adults themselves. 
There may be no sure-fire way to 
achieve this but clearly encouraging 
16-year-olds to set up homes by themselves 
has not proved to be the answer 
and can never be the answer. They 
should stay with their families or in 
supervised group homes where their 
lives have some discipline, some guidance, 
some routine, some sense of 
grounding that will let them escape the 
cycle of dependency and become self-
supporting adults. 

In addition, teen parents should stay 
in school or go back to school and 
graduate. Our bill lets States use bonuses 
or benefit reductions to give teen 
parents an incentive to finish school. 
Completing high school is the first step 
toward self-sufficiency. 

I recognize that this does not sound 
very flashy, but the parental shortcomings 
that can blight a child’s life— 
and do blight too many children’s lives 
today—require serious attention. The 
real needs of children demand sound 
policies, not sound bites. 

Our bill also asks States to intensify 
their efforts to identify noncustodial 
parents and require them to contribute 
to the upbringing of their own children. 
States should ensure that their 
welfare offices can access other State 
records such as professional licensing, 
vehicle registration, and personal property 
records. Paternity establishment 
laws should also be streamlined. 

I am always surprised to hear so 
much anger vented against young 
women as though they have achieved 
pregnancy unaided. What about the 
young men? Where is the heated political 
rhetoric aimed at them? 

What about middle-class men who divorce 
and abandon their families? 
Where is the political rhetoric telling 
them to be ashamed of themselves? 
People—be they men or women—whose 


S 16 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

actions result in parenthood must accept 
responsibility for their children. 

So our bill on teenage pregnancy is 
short on rhetoric and symbols. I have 
long been an ardent admirer of Spencer 
Tracy, but anyone who thinks a 1938 
movie about Boys Town has any bearing 
on real life children, real orphanages, 
or real families in 1995 is well out 
of touch with reality. 

The bill that will be designated S. 9, 
the Fiscal Responsibility Act, will direct 
Congress to enact legislation this 
year that will result in a balanced 
budget by the year 2003. If a goal is important 
enough to justify amending the 
Constitution, certainly it ought to be 
important enough to inspire the real 
work of deficit reduction starting this 
year. 

I have supported and voted for balanced 
budget amendments in the past, 
but a balanced budget amendment that 
sets forth an airy hope in the place of 
real promise to balance the budget is 
not good enough. 

To suggest that a balanced budget 
amendment in and of itself solves the 
problem is a copout. It is all show and 
no delivery. It is like a young man who 
gets his first job and his first credit 
card. He charges up to the limit, and 
then he promises, as soon as he has 
paid it down, he will straighten up and 
pay his balance every month. But in 
real life we know that does not happen. 
He pays down just enough to go on another 
spending spree, or get another 
credit card with a new spending limit. 

Balancing the Federal budget has 
been a Republican campaign promise 
for so long it is hard to remember 
which budget they are talking about. 
They said they intended to balance the 
budget in 1980, when they elected Ronald 
Reagan. Then they said they were 
going to balance it after 1984, conveniently 
not in the year he was actually 
running for reelection. Then they said 
George Bush was going to balance the 
budget. But what does the record show? 
Unfortunately, it shows the opposite. 

In 1980, when President Ronald 
Reagan took office, he was poised to 
present to the Congress a plan to reduce 
the deficit as he promised. At that 
time, when the Republicans had the 
majority in the Senate, the national 
debt was just over $1 trillion. 

It was a debt that took 200 years to 
accumulate, 200 years of expanding the 
Nation to its westernmost limits, with 
all the roads, rails, bridges needed, 200 
years encompassing a Civil War, two 
world wars, Korea, Vietnam, 200 years 
of creating the American dream. Almost 
$1 trillion is a lot of money. And 
we have a lot of country to show for it. 
But it took President Reagan a mere 8 
years to more than double that 200 
years’ worth of debt. 

What do we have to show for it? It 
then took President Bush just another 
4 years to add yet another trillion. So 
today, Mr. President, the heirs of that 
budgetary tradition say they are going 
to increase defense spending; they are 
going to cut taxes for the wealthy; 

and—guess what?—they are going to 
balance the Federal budget. It sounds 
like deja vu all over again, to paraphrase 
somebody we all know—Yogi 
Berra. 

I support, as I said a moment ago, a 
balanced budget. So do a majority of 
Democratic Senators. The difference 
between our position and that of many 
of our Republican colleagues is that we 
have already taken some very tough 
votes to do it. The last Congress, the 
103d, passed the President’s first budget 
which cut $500 billion in real defined 
and detailed spending over 5 years. 

We are reaping the benefit of our 
work now in reduced deficits, and a 
healthy, growing economy. The President 
deserves credit for offering that 
budget in 1993 and for fighting for it. 

We knew in 1993 that our deficit-cutting 
work that year would be only the 
beginning. Now it is 1995, and we know 
another installment of spending cuts is 
due. We say that we should do what we 
did in 1993—lay out the honest, detailed, 
and real cuts that will bring the 
deficit onto a downward path. 

The balanced budget amendment, 
standing alone, simply provides a process 
by which something should be done 
over the next 7 years. Our bill says, let 
us start doing it now. 

We have to pay attention to the numbers. 
When you balance your household 
budget, you do not do it on the assumption 
that you are going to win the Publishers’ 
Clearinghouse Sweepstakes on 
January 31 so the mortgage payments 
will be taken care of. You balance a 
household budget by looking at what 
you earn, what you spend, and where 
the numbers do not add up. So let us do 
some looking. 

If we are going to balance the budget 
by 2003, as the Republicans tell us they 
will, it is going to mean we start right 
now, this year, and start for real. 

There is a very real and expensive 
price in delay. If anyone wants to put 
off any heavy lifting for a year or 
maybe 2 years, before putting us on a 
path to balance the budget by 2003, 
they’re going to cost us another $160 
billion in debt. That is debt on top of 
the $3-trillion debt that the Republicans 
have already given us. It is debt 
that could be avoided by reducing the 
deficit now instead of delaying. 

There is another reason for acting 
now. It is called interest on the debt. It 
is a price every American taxpayer 
pays, whether he knows it or not, and 
whether he likes it or not. 

If we do nothing about balancing the 
budget for 2 years, to get past the next 
election before taking the tough actions 
needed to balance the budget by 
2003, all of us will be chipping in an 
extra $91 billion in interest to pay for 
these election-year promises. It is nice 
to have people make promises in election 
years. But nice feelings cannot 
justify $91 billion in additional interest 
on the debt. The price is too high. 

If we wait until 1997 to start balancing 
the budget, we will pay another 
$303 billion—on top of the $3-trillion 

debt—that could be avoided simply by 
acting now rather than later. 

The bill I am introducing draws on 
our past experience with balanced 
budget rhetoric and requires that we 
actually start now, this year, to do 
what we are willing to do to make our 
effort a meaningful part of the U.S. 
Constitution. 

Last, but in some ways, most important 
of all, is the bill we call S. 10. 
That is the Comprehensive Congressional 
Reform Act. It is a bill with 
three titles. It builds on the compromise 
legislation that was developed 
last year, but blocked at the end of the 
session. 

The first title will finally, and without 
equivocation, extend to the Congress 
the laws that cover all other employers 
in this country. It will require 
the Congress to abide by the Fair 
Labor Standards Act, which governs 
time and salary issues, by the Federal 
Labor-Management Relations Act, 
which provides Federal workers the 
right to bargain collectively, the workplace 
safety law, the Occupational 
Health and Safety Act, the Plant Closing 
and Notification Act, the Employee 
Polygraph Testing Act, and the Veterans 
Preference and Retention Act. 

In addition, the Democratic congressional 
coverage legislation includes the 
civil rights laws, under which the Senate 
has been operating since 1991, and 
the Family and Medical Leave Act, 
which has applied to Congress since it 
was signed into law in 1993. 

This provision is in all essential aspects 
the same bipartisan bill that was 
worked out by Senators GLENN, 
LIEBERMAN, and GRASSLEY last session, 
but which was prevented from reaching 
the Senate floor by the objection of a 
Republican Senator. 

I hope and expect our Republican colleagues 
will join, rather than obstruct, 
the effort to enact these needed reforms 
as soon as possible this year. 

The second title of S. 10 will address 
the problem of undue influence from 
special interests. 

Americans learned last year that 
something like $50 million was spent to 
defeat health care reform legislation— 
not just to defeat the President’s bill, 
but to defeat any reform bill. 

The special interest money groups 
spent more on stopping this legislation 
than on any other single issue, both in 
terms of direct lobbying and in campaign 
contributions. 

In the closing days of the 103d Congress, 
the ramifications of the crusade 
to defeat health care reform spilled 
over into another important debate: 
The debate over whether or not to rein 
in the ever-present grip of lobbyists on 
our legislative process. 

In May 1993, the Senate passed lobby 
reform by a vote of 95 to 2. Yet, when 
push came to shove, with Congress facing 
an adjournment deadline, our Republican 
colleagues invented pretexts 
and encouraged their talk-radio friends 
to help beat the lobby reform bill. As 
one of our colleagues noted, Republican 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 17 

Senators were cheered by lobbyists lining 
the hallway off this Chamber after 
Republicans killed the lobbying bill 
last fall. 

So let us be clear on what happened. 
There was no grassroots opposition to 
this bill. It was not ordinary citizens 
who wanted to kill this bill. Far from 
it. 

It was the special interest lobbyists 
who could not stand it. 

I am hoping that common decency 
will prevail in this Congress this year. 
The language I am offering in S. 10 is 
the language adopted overwhelmingly 
last summer by most of the Members 
still here in this body. 

It includes the provisions the new 
Speaker of the House, NEWT GINGRICH, 
demanded be incorporated last summer. 
They are the same provisions that 
were negotiated with Catholic charities, 
Baptist charities, Jewish groups, 
and every other religious organization 
of any standing in this country, and 
which were acceptable to all of them, 
because they did not threaten any of 
their legitimate activities. 

Title II of S. 10 does not affect grassroots 
lobbying for congressional action 
to resolve legitimate problems. No real 
grassroots group wants to kill lobbying 
reform. The reason for that is simple. 

It is because the narrow special interest 
groups who would be affected by 
the bill can buy access, can buy attention, 
can buy sympathy, and can buy 
action with money that real grassroots 
groups could never hope to match. 
True grassroots lobby efforts offer only 
the populist power of their ideas. 

There is not a genuine grassroots 
group out there that is not out-spent, 
out-gifted, out-junketed, and out-maneuvered 
by the Washington lobbying 
crowd. It is time to redress that imbalance. 


Why is so much made of those who 
feel so passionately about an issue that 
they want to allocate private resources 
to influence national policy? I suggest 
that when a foreign-owned communications 
cartel can offer the new Speaker 
of the House $4.5 million for a book, we 
should be wary of the real agenda behind 
that offer. I am pleased the new 
Speaker has now realized what an appearance 
that presents. 

Title II of the Democratic congressional 
reform bill is the legislation 
that Speaker GINGRICH said he wanted, 
asked for, demanded. Then, when it 
looked as though it could actually prevail, 
it is the legislation that Speaker 
GINGRICH asked his supporters in the 
talk-show field to fight. 

Title II of this Democratic reform 
bill also puts in the legislation our 
commitment to return control of Government 
to the American people by 
outlawing the practice of lobbyists providing 
gifts, no matter how seemingly 
insignificant, to Senators and staff. 

The lobby and gift reform provisions 
are simple. No gifts from registered 
lobbyists. No meals, no travel, no taxi 
cab rides, no sports tickets, no nothing. 
They will not need complicated 

regulations to be understood. They are 
that straightforward. 

Who is a lobbyist? Anyone who gets 
$2,500 in 6 months to work the Congress 
or the Government. They are required 
to disclose publicly who they are, what 
they earn, who pays them, and who 
they are talking to. 

That is not because we in Congress 
do not know who they are. We know 
well enough. It is to tell the American 
public who these people are and what 
they are doing. 

Congressional so-called reform that 
does not cover goodies from lobbyists 
is not reform. It is a smokescreen. It is 
telling American voters, it is back to 
business as usual. You voted for us because 
we promised reform, but we 
know you are going to tune out now. It 
is taking the American public for a 
ride. If we are to ignore those reforms, 
the American people are not prepared 
for a ride of that kind. 

As for the seriousness of this effort, 
the proof of the pudding will be self-
evident. If anyone is sincere about congressional 
reform, this is the very least 
they will need to vote for. 

If anyone says they are serious about 
reform and blocks this bill, there will 
be little doubt that they are not serious 
at all. 

I hope that will not happen for many 
reasons, but most of all, I hope it won’t 
happen, because our democracy depends 
upon a higher level of trust. I 
hope Republican Senators will not 
block the gift and lobbying reform provisions, 
as they did last year. 

Title III of the Democratic congressional 
reform bill is designed to reform 
the way congressional political campaigns 
operate. 

Again, this proposal does not break 
new ground. It is the bill passed by the 
Senate in 1993, but which was filibustered 
to prevent its going to conference 
last year. The bill is designed to do 
what everyone knows needs to be done, 
and that is to cut the money chase out 
of elected public life. 

Our bill would ban PAC contributions. 
It would outlaw for 1 year lobbying 
of an elected official to whom the 
lobbyist gave money. It would ban for 
1 year contributions from a lobbyist to 
a Member who that lobbyist had contacted 
on business. It would expand 
disclosure of so-called independent expenditures. 


It would create a flexible spending 
ceiling, based on a State’s voting age 
population. It would reward candidates 
who agreed to comply with that spending 
ceiling with broadcast discounts. 
Its costs could easily be paid without 
asking for a penny from middle-class 
taxpayers, for instance by fees on lobbying. 


In short, the campaign finance reform 
proposal would do what everyone 
is willing to say should be the law, but 
which too many are unwilling to actually 
see become law. It is time to put 
that sham behind us, too. 

If we are serious about congressional 
reform, campaign finance reform is im


perative. If we are not serious, the 
American people will know what conclusions 
to draw. 

I believe these five pieces of legislation 
reflect the priorities Americans 
expect us to set and respond to the real 
needs people face. 

The extremes have had their say. 
They have the luxury of certainty. 

We who try to work in the center are 
forced to rely on what we can learn, 
what we can know, and to move forward 
with our best efforts, not ironclad 
guarantees, because there are no guarantees 
in human life. 

Each of the bills we introduce today 
stands for a core principle in which we 
believe. None is startling, but I believe 
each is a step in the right direction. 
Together, they are a foundation on 
which to build. 

We live in a tumultuous time fraught 
with uncertainty for many Americans. 
As lawmakers, our responsibility is to 
start restoring a sense of economic and 
personal security for working Americans. 


Job training and education as a priority 
reflects the fact that we are a society 
made up of working people, and 
they must come first. If we invest in 
our own knowledge, our own skills, our 
own abilities and talents, there is not 
anything we cannot achieve. Give 
Americans the tools, and they will do 
the job. Our bill is the tool. 

Health care reforms reflect the fact 
that viruses and cancers and accidents 
happen to people without reference to 
their wealth or their personal insurance 
status or their job status. Every 
American’s economic and personal security 
is at stake. They deserve action, 
not excuses. 

Our effort on teen pregnancy reflects 
the commonsense fact that work, effort, 
and personal discipline are part of 
the lives of most Americans. Indeed, 
they help shape most of what is worthwhile 
in our lives. Government programs 
ought to reflect that common 
understanding in the way they operate, 
too. 

A Federal budget is more than a lifeless 
symbol of fiscal responsibility. It 
is the road map of our society and a reflection 
of our values. What are we 
willing to spend taxes for? Children? 
Schools? Jail cells? Special benefits for 
one or another special interest? Balancing 
the budget is not about gutting 
the government. 

It is about doing what government 
should do: Those things for all of us as 
a society that none of us can do individually 
for ourselves. Safe drinking 
water and highways, clean air and a 
safe food supply, things that government 
can do if done efficiently and effectively. 


Balancing the budget tells us that 
we’re prepared to pay for the kind of 
society we want to be. The budget’s 
shape matters as much as its size. It is 
been too big, too bloated, too long. And 
we want to start on the road to balancing 
it now. 


S 18 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

And, of course, congressional reform 
is an important symbol of self-restraint 
at the government level. If the 
people elected to government cannot 
impose restraints upon themselves and 
treat themselves like they treat others, 
what confidence can Americans 
have that government will act in their 
best interests? 

I believe, based on many statements 
by my Republican colleagues, that 
there is much common ground on 
which we can work, provided that we 
have the will to do so. 

I want to offer my assurances today 
that Democratic Senators will work 
with Republicans. We always have, and 
we are prepared to do so again this 
year. We want to go to work. We want 
to do so in a bipartisan fashion. We believe 
the American people expect and 
deserve as much. I look forward, Mr. 
President, to a productive year. 

I thank my colleagues for their patience.

f 


REVERSING HISTORICAL IRONY 

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the English 
word ‘‘irony’’ comes to us from an 
Ancient Greek word meaning ‘‘a 
dissembler in speech.’’ 

The English word ‘‘irony’’ is defined 
as the contrast between something 
that somebody thinks to be true, as revealed 
in speech, action, or common 

wisdom, and that which an audience or 
a reader knows to be true. 

Mr. President, permit me to give an 
example. 

If anyone in the hearing of my voice 
will take out a U.S. one-dollar bill and 
turn that one-dollar bill over onto its 
obverse side, he or she will read in 
clear script, ‘‘In God We Trust.’’ 

Permit me to introduce another example. 


Every day of each new meeting of the 
Senate and House of Representatives, 
an official Chaplain of each of those 
two Chambers of Congress—or a designated 
substitute—will stride to the 
dais and address a sometimes elegant 
prayer to the Deity. 

Again, every day in courtrooms 
across this country, hundreds of witnesses 
will take their place at the front 
of the court chamber, put their hands 
on incalculable numbers of Bibles, and 
swear to tell the truth, ‘‘* * * so help 
me God.’’ 

Only today, I and several other Senators 
swore an oath, standing there 
near the Presiding Officer where he sits 
now, swore an oath that we would support 
and defend the Constitution of the 
United States against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic, that we would bear 
true allegiance to the same, that we 
took this obligation, freely without 
mental reservation or purpose of evasion, 
and that we would well and faithfully 
discharge the duties of the office 
on which we were about to enter ‘‘so 
help me God.’’ 

Additionally, daily, thousands of men 
and women in a variety of groups, and 
millions upon millions of boys and girls 
in our schools will pledge allegiance to 
our flag, uttering among others the 
words ‘‘* * * one nation, under God, 
* * *’’ 

I was a Member of the Congress when 
Congress inserted those words into the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 

And here is the irony: in spite of that 
chain of rituals that I have just related, 
in situation after situation, anecdotal 
and documented both, public 
school authorities, ostensibly following 
rulings of the Supreme Court dating 
from at least the 1960’s, have prohibited 
the utterance of prayers at school 
functions, in classrooms, at school 
commencement exercises, even when 
the students themselves wanted to 
have a voluntary prayer which they 
themselves would compose, or even in 
groups or privately on public school 
property. 

Mr. President, as I read my U.S. Constitution, 
such a prohibition of prayer 
in school flies in the face of the First 
Amendment, which declares, ‘‘Congress 
shall make no law respecting an establishment 
of religion, or prohibiting the 
free exercise thereof * * *.’’ 

Therefore, our Government is supposed 
to be absolutely neutral in this 
matter, and the Constitution provides 
that neutrality when it says Congress 
shall make no law respecting the establishment 
of religion, on the one hand, 
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, 

on the other. That is absolute—absolute—
neutrality. 

So please note those words again: 
‘‘* * * or prohibiting the free exercise 
thereof * * *’’ 

That passage was explicitly written 
into our Bill of Rights at the insistence 
of none other than James Madison— 
commonly remembered as the father of 
the Constitution—based on direct appeals 
to Madison by Baptist ministers 
in Virginia who had been forced to support 
the official state church during 
the Colonial Era, and whose practice of 
their own religious choice had been officially 
denied, proscribed, or penalized 
by Colonial officials. 

How ironic that from that understandable 
Constitutional safeguard in 
support of the free exercise of religious 
faith, opponents of any religion have 
turned that passage of the First 
Amendment on its head to prohibit—I 
said, to prohibit—the free exercise of 
religion in our public life and, particularly, 
to drive religious faith out of our 
public schools. 

It is equally ironic that, as religion is 
making a public resurgence in the long 
atheistic former Soviet Union, our Nation, 
whose protofoundations stand on 
the sacrifices of hundreds of thousands 
of early colonists whose primary inspiration 
in coming to America in the 
first place—Congregationalists, Calvinists, 
Baptists, Jews, Catholics, Orthodox, 
and others—whose primary purpose 
in coming to America in the first 
place, I repeat, was a yearning for religious 
liberty against those who would 
deny them the right of religious lib-
erty—that our Nation should be embarked 
on a course which, in effect, denies 
religious liberty to many of its 
citizens. 

Mr. President, I have heard increasing 
concerns about the lack of moral 
orientation among so many younger 
Americans—about a rising drug epidemic 
among our children, about rampant 
sexual promiscuity, about children 
murdering children, about gangs of 
teenage thugs terrorizing their neighborhoods, 
and about a pervading moral 
malaise among youth in both our inner 
cities and our suburbs. 

Is there any wonder that so many 
young Americans should be drifting 
with seemingly no ethical moorings in 
the face of an apparent effort to strip 
every shred of recognizable ethics, of 
teachings about values, and spirituality 
from the setting in which those 
young Americans spend most of their 
waking hours—our public schools? 

Mr. President, in an effort to restore 
something of a spiritual balance to our 
public schools and to extracurricular 
activities in our public schools, I am 
today introducing a joint resolution to 
propose an Amendment to the Constitution 
clarifying the intent of the 
Constitution with regard to public 
school prayer. 

My amendment is an effort to make 
clear that neither the Constitution, or 
the amendments thereto, require, nor 
do they prohibit, voluntary prayer in 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 19 

the public schools or in the extracurricular 
activities of the public 
schools. Anyone who fears that the language 
of my amendment would allow 
public schools to mandate the recitation 
of daily prayer, or that school administrators 
will become the authors 
of such prayers, need not worry. This 
amendment does not supplant the clear 
proscription contained in the ‘‘establishment’’ 
clause of the First Amendment. 
My amendment is an effort to 
make clear that the words that the 
Constitution uses with regard to religious 
freedom do not mean that voluntary 
prayer is prohibited from our 
public schools or public school activities. 


In short, I hope to end a three-decades-
long tyranny of the minority in 
denying to the majority of Americans 
the least vestige of the exercise of a 
liberty otherwise guaranteed by the 
Constitution—the right of American 
children in our public school system to 
pray in accordance with their own consciences 
and in the privacy of their voluntary 
associations within our public 
schools. 

That right I sincerely believe the 
Constitution already grants, but I want 
to spell out in that same Constitution, 
by way of an amendment thereto, that 
permission to pray voluntarily in our 
public schools does not constitute ‘‘an 
establishment of religion.’’ 

Mr. President, on this, the first day 
of the 104th Congress, a Congress in 
which the controlling mantra seems to 
have become ‘‘change’’ and ‘‘reform,’’ I 
would suggest that Members listen to 
the American people. 

Every Senator who stands here proposes 
to speak in accordance with the 
wishes of the American people. Each 
Senator arrogates to himself the right 
to speak on behalf of the American 
people. I would suggest that Members 
listen to the American people. Indeed, 
Mr. President, I would call my colleagues’ 
attention to a recent poll reprinted 
in the December 17 issue of National 
Journal in which passage of a 
constitutional amendment allowing 
school prayer was the number one legislative 
priority the public wanted us 
to consider. Not the balanced budget 
amendment. Not the line-item veto. 
Not amending the filibuster rule so as 
to permit the invoking of cloture by a 
mere majority of the Senate. Who 
cares about that, out there beyond the 
Beltway? 

Rather, the American people clearly 
understand the need for us to begin to 
restore the moral underpinnings of this 
Nation. 

With introduction, and I hope eventual 
passage of my amendment, we can 
finally begin the 7-year-long process to 
answer the people’s concerns. We can 
begin to restore the spiritual compass 
that has been lost in the lives of so 
many of our citizens. And most importantly, 
we can begin to return to our 
children the moral orientation that 
they so desperately need and desire. 

I urge those who want to deliver on 
the wishes of the American people to 
join me in this effort. 

Mr. President, I shall introduce this 
for referral to a committee. I have notified 
the minority, the now majority— 
it is going to be a little difficult for me 
to stop thinking in those terms. I am 
going to have to, for a while at least. I 
have also notified the majority that I 
intend to try to put this resolution on 
the calendar under rule 14. If nobody 
objects to further proceedings at that 
point, I will, but I believe Mr. 
KEMPTHORNE is aware of what I am 
about to do and he will be prepared to 
object at the right time. 

So, Mr. President, first I will attempt 
to get this resolution on the calendar 
under the provisions of rule 14, and 
then I will introduce it as a resolution 
to be referred. 

Mr. President, I send to the desk a 
resolution. Let me read it so that everybody 
will understand clearly what 
it says: 

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House 
concurring therein), That the following article 
is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution, 
which shall be valid to all intents 
and purposes as part of the Constitution 
when ratified by the legislatures of three-
fourths of the several States within seven 
years after the date of its submission to the 
States for ratification: 

‘‘ARTICLE— 
‘‘SECTION 1. Nothing in this Constitution, 
or amendments thereto, shall be construed 
to prohibit or require voluntary prayer in 
public schools, or to prohibit or require voluntary 
prayer at public school extracurricular 
activities.’’. 
Mr. President, I send this joint resolution 
to the desk, and I ask that it be 
read the first time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will read the joint resolution for 
the first time. 
The assistant legislative clerk read 
as follows: 
A resolution (S.J. Res. 7) proposing an 
amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States to clarify the intent of the Constitution 
to neither prohibit nor require public 
school prayer. 
Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask that 
the resolution be read a second time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I 
object. 
Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator withhold 
his objection until it is read the second 
time, and then he can object and it will 
go on the calendar. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The assistant legislative clerk proceeded 
to call the roll. 
Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I withdraw 
my request for a second reading of the 
resolution today. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? The Chair hears none. 

Mr. BYRD. It will automatically 
come up for a second reading on the 
next legislative day; am I correct? 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. 

Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished 
Senator. I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. 
HELMS] have his name added as a cosponsor 
of the resolution. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Chair thanks the Senator and it will be 
so ordered. 

Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the 
Chair. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Idaho. 

(The remarks of Mr. KEMPTHORNE 
pertaining to the introduction of S. 1 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 

Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from California. 

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if you 
could explain the rules today, may I 
have my 10 minutes now from the time 
of the Democratic leader? 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? The Chair hears none, and it 
is so ordered. 

Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair very 
much. 

Mr. President, I come to the floor 
today to congratulate those Senators— 
both Democratic and Republican—who 
took the oath of office today, and I 
come to the floor of the Senate to look 
ahead to the future. 

Those of us who serve here are truly 
blessed with an opportunity quite 
rate—to represent our States in the 
greatest deliberative body in the 
world—one with a rich legacy of dedicated 
men and women whose service is 
always judged by history. 

Like 1992, 1994 has been a year of political 
change. In 1992, 105 million 
Americans went to the polls and voted 
for a Democratic President, dislodging 
a Republican President. In 1994, 70 million 
Americans went to the polls and 
voted for a Republican Congress, dislodging 
a Democratic Congress. 

The American people voted for 
change in 1992 but change didn’t happen 
fast enough, so they sent another 
message in 1994. 

Change was on the lips of the American 
people in 1992 and change is still 
on the Nation’s lips of the American 
people in 1994. 

Each of us is asked what change 
means. 

First, I believe people want the 
American Dream restored; they want 
economic security. American people 
feel they no longer can be sure of having 
a job, of having health care coverage, 
of raising their standard of living, 
no longer sure of our children having 
good paying jobs, owning a home, 
having Social Security or personal 


S 20 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

safety. As Robert Reich said, these 
changes have turned the middle class 
into the anxiety class. 

Second, I believe people want to feel 
safe in their neighborhoods. They know 
that ideological fights will not get 
them safer neighborhoods. The people 
recognize that we need a commonsense 
mix of tougher punishment and effective 
prevention. To serve the people, 
we must have the guts to keep all cop-
killer bullets off the streets. 

Third, I believe people want the deficit 
reduced by smart spending cuts, 
leaving smart spending priorities. People 
want the Government to stop wasting 
their money, but they want their 
Government to have a strategy so we 
can be part of the solution. 

Fourth, I believe people want to have 
a Government that doesn’t interfere in 
their lives, but defends their individual 
freedoms. 

Fifth, I believe people want a Congress 
that acts in the best interests of 
the people of the United States of 
America so that our families have an 
unbought voice, our children have an 
unbought voice, our environment has 
an unbought voice, and our country 
can rely on a Congress whose Members 
don’t cash in on their power. Let’s keep 
out the special interests and let’s live 
by the same laws as all Americans do. 

Now I want to say that I came to the 
Senate representing 31 million people 
on that very platform in 1992, and nothing 
about the 1994 election tells me 
that that platform of hope, economic 
opportunity, individual rights, and 
congressional reform has lost its significance. 


Certainly, I stand ready to fulfill 
those goals in new and better ways. 
None of us has all the answers, but together 
we can find them. We should 
choose from all the best ideas from 
each political party, and from new Senators 
as well as old. I stand ready to do 
that, and I have already reached out to 
my Republican friends. 

But let me tell you what I do not 
stand ready to do. 

I do not stand ready to allow those 
who talk about reform to destroy protections 
and rights guaranteed to all 
Americans. 

I believe the Republican Contract 
With America calls for just that, and 
since their goal is to pass it in 3 
months, I feel I must speak out. 

The contract talks about bringing 
back the gag rule to health care clinics. 
Here is the contract that professes 
less government on the one hand, but 
uses the Republican hand to gag doctors 
and nurses in clinics from telling 
their patients that abortion is legal option 
in this country. When that fight 
comes, I will be right here. And speaking 
of health care clinics, I trust my 
colleagues will support law and order 
in a tragic escalation of violence waged 
against lawabiding Americans. 

Law and order plays a big part in the 
contract which is fine. But, sadly, it 
resurrects the old fight between punishment 
and prevention. We should lis


ten to law enforcement authorities who 
tell us we need both. Let us not undo 
the crime bill that police worked so 
hard for. If there is a move to rescind 
the crime bill in the name of fighting 
crime I will be right here to fight it. 

Middle-class tax relief? I am here. It 
was the President who promised it during 
his campaign, and he has defined a 
very fair middle-class bill of rights 
that helps families with children and 
eases the burden of college tuition 
costs. I support this. 

The Republican contract talks about 
the middle class, and I am with them 
all the way. But if what they really 
mean is tax breaks for those worth millions, 
I will be right here to point out 
the farce. 

Tax relief should not help Members 
of Congress. We make enough. It 
should help the middle class. There are 
still those with multiple millions of 
dollars sneaking through tax loopholes. 
We do not need more of that, we need 
less. 

The contract talks about orphanages 
and poor children being denied nutrition 
assistance. I will not stand by and 
allow children to starve or be torn 
away from parents or grandparents in 
the name of reform. I do not care if 
‘‘Boys Town’’ is a good film. We better 
learn from the past, not go back to it 
when it did not work. 

I am ready to talk about work requirements 
and tough standards for 
welfare. 

That’s absolutely essential. We must 
not reward laziness or excuses. I am 
here to talk about smart incentives 
like workable group homes for kids and 
those responsible for them; I am here 
to talk about real punishment for 
those who neglect their kids. But if 
you push policies that in the name of 
reform hurt these kids and make them 
hungry or homeless or abused, I will be 
there to take them on. 

The contract calls for securities litigation 
reform to end what the contract 
calls ‘‘frivolous laws suits.’’ This 
sounds great, but when you read the 
fine print you see a plan that would let 
greedy and irresponsible parties completely 
off the hook after they dump 
risky investments on the public. 

The Republican contract would 
heighten the economic insecurity of 
millions of Americans who save for the 
future; have a 401K savings plan, a corporate 
pension plan, an IRA, or a mutual 
fund. 

The contract would make it almost 
impossible for small investors to successfully 
sue well-heeled investment 
bankers for fraud. It would require 
small investors to prove their case—to 
know what went on in the mind of anyone 
who defrauded them—before they 
file suit. It requires small investors to 
be mind readers. 

How would this Republican contract 
have affected Ramonna Jacobs of Los 
Angeles. Mrs. Jacobs, unwittingly, invested 
money earmarked for her disabled 
daughter in Charles Keating’s 
junk bonds. 

Mrs. Jacobs could not have successfully 
sued Charles Keating if the Republican 
contract was in effect. There 
was no way Mrs. Jacobs could have 
known, at the get-go, how Charles 
Keating schemed to defraud her, what 
Charles Keating knew and when he 
knew it. 

Deception is the essence of securities 
fraud. The Republican contract ignores 
that. In doing so it will increase the in-
security—economic and otherwise—of 
millions of Americans. 

I will fight that kind of destructive 
legislation disguised as reform. 

I will not stand by and allow our people 
to be hurt by gutting air and water 
quality standards in the name of deregulation 
as the contract says. 

If you want to talk about streamlining 
regulations that bureaucrats are 
bungling I’ll be right there. There is no 
need to have people hung out to dry 
while we figure out how to apply environmental 
laws. I agree with that. 

But if by ‘‘streamlining’’ you really 
mean destroying or ripping away sensible 
environmental protection laws, 
I’ll be right here to call it the way I see 
it. 

I ran as a fighter for the people of 
California and as I figure it, if you cannot 
breathe you cannot work or live. 
Today a baby born in Los Angeles has 
a 15 percent lower lung capacity then a 
baby born in a clear air area. That’s 
wrong. 

And let us cut spending where it 
makes sense to do so. We have opportunities 
all over the Federal budget. I 
look forward to working constructively 
to do that on the Budget Committee 
and on the Senate floor. But the Republican 
contract calls for fencing off 
one part of the budget so savings cannot 
be used for anything else. Why 
should one part of the budget be treated 
differently? The contract puts the 
military budget in a separate area behind 
the fence and it throws away the 
key. They do not do that for Social Security. 
They do not do that for Medicare—
they don’t do that for education 
or for law enforcement. They only do 
that for the military budget. 

Now I am all for a strong military 
and against wasteful military spending. 
In the eighties we found out we 
were buying $7,500 coffee pots and $600 
toilet seats and $350 ‘‘No Smoking’’ 
signs and spending millions on weapons 
that blew up fans in portable toilets instead 
of helicopters and billions on star 
wars when tests were rigged to make it 
look good. 

And I have news for you even today: 
with all the reforms we’ve enacted, we 
still have generals taking $200,000 military 
flights. An Air Force general recently 
had a VIP C–141B Starlifter fly 
from New Jersey to pick him up—along 
with his cat and an aide—in Naples, 
Italy, and fly him to Colorado. The 
flight cost between $120,000 and $200,000. 
A commercial ticket would have cost 
less than $1,500. 

And believe it or not, we are paying 
convicted felons in the military mil



January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 21 

lions of dollars a year while they sit in 
jail. No one could get away with that 
in the private sector. 

In the meantime, we continue to 
spend two to three times more on the 
military than all other enemies combined. 


So let us not have any sacred cows. It 
makes us weaker as a nation, not 
stronger. Let’s determine what it takes 
to meet the threats we face—debate 
the appropriate level of funding, always 
be ready to procure the funding 
for emergencies but let’s not fence off 
one part of the responsibility. 

Let me read from the preamble of the 

U.S. Constitution: 
We the People of the United States, in 
order to form a more perfect Union, establish 
justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide 
for the common defense, promote the general 
welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to 
ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and 
establish, this Constitution for the United 
States of America. 
It doesn’t say provide for the common 
defense only. 
It does not say, ‘‘provide for the common 
defense and, if you feel like, promote 
the general welfare.’’ 

It does not say that providing for the 
common defense takes precedence over 
establishing justice. 

It says to do all those things. 

I believe in our Constitution. Some of 
the things I hear lead me to believe 
that the preamble of the Constitution 
has become meaningless to some Members 
of Congress—I fervently hope not. 

I have great confidence in the institutions 
of our Government. They have 
prevailed through many political and 
economic times more trying than 
these. 

But they are always tested. 

I intend to make sure our institutions 
pass this test. 

That the Government of, by, and for 
the people will prevail and not be destroyed 
in the name of slogans and 
rhetoric. 

I look forward to a legitimate debate 
on how we can make this the most 
prosperous country, the fairest country, 
and the healthiest country in the 
world. I hold out my hand in the search 
for constructive solutions, but I hold 
up my hand to destructive political 
posturing. 

The American people want us to 
work together. They want the filibuster 
abuse to end—they want us to 
take the best ideas—whoever has 
them—and turn them into policies. 

They want us to work with the executive 
branch for progress. 

Let us do that. 

But I also believe the people from my 
State of California expect me to fight 
for them above all, and if that means 
standing on the floor of the Senate all 
by myself to do that, I will—any day, 
any hour. That’s the promise I made to 
them.

SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES ACT 

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator 
from Alaska introduced the Sustainable 
Fisheries Act previously and 
placed my comments in the RECORD as 
if read in full. 

I will simply address those comments 
except to say that we have a crisis in 
Massachusetts and New England, now a 
crisis that will grow across this country 
and all coastal States. We desperately 
need a better regimen for 
managing the fisheries of this country. 
It is my hope that colleagues, while we

enormous importance to people whose

BROOKLINE ABORTION CLINIC 
MURDERS 

Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is 
the second time in 6 months that I 
have risen to discuss the terrifying implications 
of abortion clinic murders, 
but now I am deeply saddened that my 
State has joined others that have seen 
the horror and felt the pain of this 
senseless violence. 

Last Friday morning at 10 a.m. Shannon 
Lowney, a 25-year-old activist 
working as a receptionist at a clinic in 
Brookline, MA, looked up and smiled 
at a man who had just walked into her 
office. It was John Salvi. 

In response to her smile and welcome, 
he pulled a collapsible Ruger 
rifle from his bag—aimed it at Shannon 
and fired at point-blank range. He 
killed Shannon and wounded three others. 


In mourning her death, many people 
in Massachusetts and in the country 
are wondering about why this occurred 
and they are also wondering about who 
was Shannon Lowney and what does 
her life now show us. 

Her friends called her ‘‘Shanny’’ and 
she was a very caring, committed 
young woman who represents the best 
of her generation. She cared about people. 
She tutored Spanish-speaking children 
in Cambridge, helped poor villagers 
in Ecuador, worked with abused 
children in Maine, and last week she 
finished her application to Boston University 
for a masters in social work. 

She was one of those rare people in a 
generation that has been often called 
Generation X or the uninvolved generation, 
yet Shannon confronted injustice 
and acted on her deep and abiding belief 
that we are all in this together; 
that we are community and each of us 
must accept our personal responsibility 
within that community, no matter 
what our beliefs. 

The irony and the tragedy is that to 
John Salvi, Shannon’s life meant nothing 
except an opportunity to make a 
statement. The good and the decent 
life of someone who truly cared about 
others was taken in the name of life. 

Mr. President, no matter what our 
views on abortion might be, I am confident 
that every decent American 
mourns the senseless murder of Shannon 
Lowney and is touched by the loss 
of someone so young and so committed 
to working with other people. 

Contrast Shannon’s life and her motives 
and the motives of a man like 
John Salvi—a man who killed one person 
and wounded five others and then 
left Planned Parenthood and walked a 
few blocks to the Preterm Health Services 
Clinic where he asked Lee Ann 
Nicols, a 38-year-old receptionist engaged 
to be married this year, whether 
this was, indeed, the Preterm Clinic. 
She said yes, and he shot her from less 
than 1 yard away killing her on the 
spot. 

He then said, ‘‘In the name of the 
mother of God,’’ aimed at Richard 
Seron, a lawyer working as a security 
guard, and shot him once in each arm. 
He shot one other person, 29-year-old 
June Sauer once in the pelvis, once in 
the back, and then he left. 

So five people injured, two people 
killed. He then drove 600 miles south to 
the Hillcrest Clinic in Norfolk, VA, 
where he went on another shooting 
spree, but nobody was hurt. And now 
we must ask ourselves what does this 
mean, who is John Salvi, and what 
does his life show us? 

On Christmas eve, Salvi delivered a 
sermon about the Catholic Church and 
its failure to see the true meaning of 
Christ. But what was his motivation 
beyond whatever warped perceptions he 
had as a diviner of the scriptures? 

Paul Hill, the minister currently on 
Florida’s death row, gives us some insight 
into John Salvi’s motivations. 
Hill gave us a chilling reason for killing 
a doctor and his assistant in Pensacola. 
He said: 

The Bible teaches us to do unto others as 
you would have them do unto you. Therefore, 
according to his reasoning killing a 
man who is about to kill an unborn child 
constitutes self-defense. 


S 22 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

To Paul Hill, the murder was a justifiable 
homicide. 

Mr. President, this syllogism lies at 
the heart of one of the most corrosive 
dangers that we face in an ever increasingly 
violent world and a violent America. 


There are religious teachings that 
offer justifiable excuses for killing, but 
the mainstream religions, all of them, 
have always promoted tolerance over 
intolerance. The only people who use 
religion to justify cold-blooded murder 
are religious fanatics, and they must 
be recognized as such. 

But what happened in Brookline and 
what happened to Shannon Lowney and 
Lee Ann Nicols and the tragedy of 
their deaths tells us that we can no 
longer dismiss these fringe elements of 
our society, we can no longer let good 
people fall victim to intolerance and 
fanaticism. 

Yes, John Salvi read from the same 
Bible that Shannon and Lee Ann did. 
The teachings and the words were the 
same, but their lives could not have 
been more different. 

It is our task to remember that commitment 
and dedication can be manifest 
in kindness and concern, or they 
can take the hideous form of fanaticism 
and hatred that motivated John 
Salvi to play God. 

Mr. President, it is incumbent on all 
of us, and particularly as we begin this 
term in the Senate, to understand the 
increasing danger that can be wrought 
by those who interpret religious teachings 
as a crusade against others and as 
a justification for cold-blooded murder 
or for violent acts. 

It is our task to understand that we 
live in dangerous times and that the 
easy availability of weapons in society 
makes it even more dangerous. People 
like John Salvi and Paul Hill have increased 
the danger and increased the 
threat to those who choose to show 
their commitment and their faith by 
helping others build a better life for 
themselves and their families. 

So I believe, Mr. President, it is time 
for both sides on the abortion issue to 
exert leadership and to show that we 
can find a way to express our views 
without increasing the rhetorical violence 
or the physical violence. 

It is our task to sit down and to talk 
to each other, and I commend my 
friend and constituent and his eminence, 
Cardinal Bernard Law of the 
Archdiocese of Boston, for his personal 
efforts to bring both sides together. He 
has shown courage in this regard. Even 
though he is strongly pro-life, he has 
called for an end, temporarily at least, 
to antiabortion protests in Boston. He 
is trying to bring everyone together in 
an unprecedented sense of negotiation. 

Cardinal Law has shown leadership 
and tolerance, and his deep faith serves 
as an example to all of us who want to 
bring an end to the senseless violence. 
What we achieve together can send a 
loud and clear message to those who 
would use their beliefs as justification 
for murder that, though we may not 

agree, we are still one people bound together 
not only by our faith and our 
commitments to our beliefs but by the 
expression of our common interest 
through tolerance for our differences 
and a mutual respect and understanding 
for each other. 

Mr. President, Shannon Lowney, obviously, 
did not deserve her fate. She 
was a good and decent woman, though 
some might disagree with what she 
chose to do. They certainly could not 
wish on her the death she found. She 
was the personification of the principles 
of freedom, freedom of choice 
and equality and the justice that 
unites us as a people, and she was 
working to help others because she 
cared about other human beings. 

Make no mistake, the wrong response 
to these shootings would be to turn 
clinics into armed fortresses on the 
fringes of our medical delivery system, 
further from those who have a constitutional 
right to seek the procedure. 

We must learn from this and, indeed, 
in tribute to those who died, make certain 
that this constitutional right is 
protected at the Federal, State, and 
local level by providing the resources 
necessary to maintain peace in our 
country. 

When those shots rang out in Brook-
line last Friday, Mr. President, John 
Salvi did not just take life, he took 
something very precious from all of us. 
He took our freedom to believe and to 
express our beliefs as we choose and he 
took our freedom to act on our beliefs 
without fear of violence. We cannot 
permit that to happen in this country. 

For many days, there will be many 
who will continue to mourn the deaths 
of Shannon Lowney and Lee Ann 
Nicols. The people of my State will remain 
shocked and outraged at this 
senseless act of violence that took 
them from us. And I know I speak for 
every Member of the Senate in extending 
our deepest condolences to their 
families and friends and to all the victims 
of this tragedy. 

The lesson, Mr. President, is tolerance, 
and it is a lesson we would do 
well to learn and to think about as we 
witness other divisions in the United 
States of America, particularly the division 
of race. If we do not learn it, 
then we will dishonor the memory of 
these two young women from Massachusetts 
who lost their lives through 
intolerance in the name of God. 

I yield the floor. 

Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.

from Louisiana. 

f 


PROPER AND LEGITIMATE ROLE 
OF GOVERNMENT 

Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I say to 
my colleagues, we have all just undergone 
an election process, a great debate 
that has occurred in this country, 
culminating in the elections on November 
8, which saw those of us who 
are Democrats lose the majority both 

in this body as well as in the other 
body. 

I think a great part of that debate 
was over the proper and legitimate role 
of Government as it affects the individual 
lives of the citizens of this country. 

Many traditional Democrats—not all, 
but many—have taken the view that 
the proper role of Government is to try 
to solve everybody’s problem all of the 
time, and that necessarily meant that 
many of those suggestions were coming 
from Washington as to what those solutions 
should be. Many, not all, Republicans 
took the view that the role 
of Government was to get out of the 
way and that Government really had 
no role in helping people solve their 
problems, but that it was more of a 
survival of the fittest type of attitude 
that should be the predominant one by 
which we govern ourselves. 

I think both of those roles are not 
what the American people were talking 
about when they went to the polls on 
November 8. Many self-styled new 
Democrats take the view that the legitimate 
and proper role of Government 
is to help equip people to solve 
their own problems. Government’s role 
is not to solve their problems, nor is 
Government’s role to get out of the 
way and let the survival of the fittest 
be the rule of the day. But, rather, the 
proper role of Government is to try to 
help and equip people to be able to 
solve their own problems. That is a 
viewpoint that I think is proper and 
one that I share. 

In keeping with that perspective of 
what Government’s role is, I have 
joined with Democratic leader DASCHLE 
and Senator KENNEDY, of Massachusetts, 
in introducing legislation, which 
is S. 6, which is entitled the Working 
Americans Opportunity Act. 

I think it is legislation which all 
Members should carefully consider because 
it takes as its premise that the 
role of Government is to help people 
solve their own problems, to help them 
equip themselves to meet the needs and 
the problems they are facing. 

We all know that in today’s society 
the average American worker has to 
change jobs several times in a lifetime. 
We all know that a great deal of the insecurity 
that Americans have in their 
daily lives is because they do not know 
whether the job they are in today will 
be there tomorrow. They do not know 
whether they will have the training 
and the skills to go out and seek a new 
job, perhaps in a new area, perhaps in 
a new profession, because they have 
not been properly trained. 

S. 6, the Working Americans Opportunity 
Act, provides the types of training, 
the types of opportunities that 
American workers need in order to 
equip themselves to meet the challenges 
of the future. President Clinton 
has in his proposal for a middle-class 
bill of rights a similar proposal. The 
President has said many times that 
what you earn is tied to what you learn 
in this country, and that is a very true 
statement. 

January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 23 

Our legislation will try to help Americans 
learn more so that in their lives 
they can earn more. What we do with 
this legislation is to build on the old GI 
bill with which so many Americans are 
familiar, where returning servicemen 
after World War II were given an opportunity 
to select a college, an institution 
they would like to attend, and the 
Government helped them equip themselves 
by giving them the money which 
allowed them to select where they 
wanted to go to college, and also to select 
what courses they would take. 

The Government did not make that 
decision. The Government in Washington, 
after World War II, did not tell 
young Americans where they had to go 
to college. It did not tell them, when 
they got there, what courses they had 
to take. It did not tell them in what 
they had to major. The Government at 
that time had faith in the individual 
American citizen to make that decision 
on their own because Government 
at that time felt the individual would 
make the right decision; they would 
take the courses they felt they were 
best able to do well in; they would go 
to the college they felt best suited 
their particular need. 

There was no bureaucracy or no Government 
in Washington that made that 
decision. That is one of the reasons 
why the GI bill was such a good piece 
of legislation and why thousands and 
thousands of Americans today have 
lived a better life, because someone 
had the intelligence back in the 1940’s 
to offer legislation which made that 
type of career education possible for 
hundreds of millions of Americans. 

What we have offered today is building 
on that concept. It will give to 
Americans who have been dislocated 
because of a plant closing or because 
they have been fired, they have been 
laid off, vouchers to allow individuals 
to select the type of training they 
want, at the place they want, the type 
of program they want, they feel best 
suited they can handle, and then enroll 
and better themselves so they can earn 
more in later life. 

Mr. President and my colleagues, we 
have hundreds of programs in the Federal 
bureaucracy. We have agencies all 
over the place that have job training 
programs where bureaucrats in Washington 
are deciding for an individual in 
my State of Louisiana what is the best 
course they can take or where they 
should go to school. This legislation 
says the individual should have the 
ability to make that decision; that our 
role in Government is to give that person 
a voucher and let them decide 
where they want to go and what 
courses they want to take. I think this 
concept is one of which the President is 
supportive, one of which I think many 
of our Republican colleagues will be 
supportive because it eliminates the 
bureaucratic, governmental decision 
maker in Washington and allows the 
decision to be made back at the local 
level by the person who is going to benefit 
from that decision in the first 

place—the individual who is going to 
benefit from these vouchers. 

I would point out that this concept of 
putting the workers in charge of their 
own fate rather than having their fate 
decided in Washington is going to accomplish 
a couple of things. No. 1, it 
would really I think for the first time 
allow the workers to take charge of 
their career, let them decide what they 
want to do instead of having that decision 
made in Washington. 

Second, I think allowing that individual 
to decide where they want to go 
and what school they would like to attend 
for the training they are seeking 
is going to provide competition among 
private and public institutions for that 
individual’s interest, to compete for 
that individual’s business. I think that 
competition will provide better services. 
Right now there is not a great 
deal of competition among training institutions 
because the Government 
makes the decision where these individuals 
have to go. There is no competition. 
This legislation would create 
competition among these schools to 
compete for those individuals coming 
to their institutions, and I think they 
would provide a better product. 

Third, competition would provide accountability 
for performance. Dissatisfied 
customers could vote with their 
feet, taking their business to more effective 
providers. 

And fourth, bureaucracies that run 
the current program would certainly be 
reduced. I am told by I think the General 
Accounting Office that we have 
literally hundreds of departments and 
agencies in Washington that run job 
training programs. We already spend 
literally billions of dollars in Washington 
on job training programs right 
now. Our legislation says we should not 
be spending any more money. It is a 
question of spending it more wisely. 

Our legislation takes money from existing 
bureaucratic programs in Washington 
and uses the dollars to create 
vouchers to give to individuals to let 
them make the decision as to where 
they can best get their best education 
and the best retraining to compete in 
today’s modern world. The global economy 
that we are now talking about 
creates a lot of opportunities for Americans, 
but it also has created a lot of 
problems for Americans because many 
jobs people are involved in today are 
not going to be here tomorrow because 
of the changing global competition and 
environment. 

This Congress just in the last year 
passed a North American Free Trade 
Agreement. We passed a GATT agreement. 
That is going to make global 
competition more and more and create 
more opportunities for American workers 
and for American businesses. But 
we cannot do it if our workers are not 
trained. We cannot do it if our workers 
are still educated to work in jobs that 
are not the jobs of the future, that are 
not the jobs in a global environment 
with global competition. 

I think this legislation for the first 
time will say that we are going to recognize 
that individuals, citizens back 
home have the ability to make the decisions 
for themselves. But Government 
does have a role. It is not survival 
of the fittest. It is not just throwing 
everybody out there and saying 
some will survive and some will perish, 
but it is saying Government’s role will 
be to help people make the best decisions 
for their lives. 

So I would suggest the legislation we 
have introduced today, the Working 
Americans Opportunity Act, is in keeping 
with that theory, that there is a legitimate 
role for Government to help 
equip our citizens to make their own 
decisions and to help them solve their 
problems. 

That is the role of Government I 
think most Americans share. I think it 
was one of the clear messages of the 
last election. I think all of us have to 
take heed of those results, Republicans 
and Democrats alike. This legislation 
is a major step in that direction, and I 
urge my colleagues to consider joining 
with us in supporting this legislation 
as it has been introduced. 

Mr. President, I now yield the floor. 

Mr. EXON addressed the Chair. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Nebraska. 

Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise 
today to lend enthusiastic support to 

S. 9, which I think is probably one of 
the most important, if not far-reaching, 
measures that have been introduced 
today, along with very many 
other important measures. 
S. 9 addresses the matter of the constitutional 
amendment to balance the 
budget. I have long been a supporter of 
that, and my name has been mentioned 
by my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle. I was very pleased to join as a cosponsor 
of the bill of the Democratic 
leader to focus attention on this matter. 
I also happen to be the ranking Democrat 
on the Budget Committee, and 
the Budget Committee, with all of its 
other very important responsibilities, 
is going to play a very key, a very decisive 
role in the constitutional amendment 
to balance the budget. 

I rise today though to say while I 
voted for it before and I am going to 
vote for it again, I am going to be 
plowing a straight furrow down the 
road on this whole matter to explain to 
the Senate and to the House and to the 
people at large that passing a constitutional 
amendment to balance the budget 
is the easy part. 

There has been no legislation introduced 
today, and I daresay there will 
be no legislation introduced in this 
Congress, that has such far-reaching 
implications. This is where the rubber 
meets the road. Passing a constitutional 
amendment—which I believe 
will be passed—is the easy part. In 
doing so, we have to have a thorough 
understanding by every Member of the 
Senate, every Member of the House of 
Representatives, every Governor, every 


S 24 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

legislator in every State and the people 
at large, as to the awesome task that 
we take upon ourselves when we pass 
this measure. It is not going to be easy. 
It is probably one of the most difficult 
tasks that the Congress of the United 
States all during our history has ever 
saddled itself with. But saddle it we 
must if we are going to stop runaway 
deficits, skyrocketing national debts. 

I think the first thing we have to 
have a full understanding with the people 
on, if they do not understand it 
now, is that there is a difference between 
the annual deficit and the national 
debt. I am afraid the people hear 
about the $150 to $350 billion annual 
deficit and then they hear about the 
skyrocketing national debt that was 
addressed earlier in the day by Senator 
DASCHLE, under $1 trillion in 1980 and 
now it is $4.7 trillion. They hear often 
that the fastest growing part of our 
budget is interest on the national debt. 

I simply say that if we are going to 
balance the Federal budget by the year 
2002, as is outlined in most of the measures 
that have been introduced thus 
far, we are going to have to cut $1 trillion 
or more, depending on how much 
money we expend for tax decreases— 
worthy or unworthy, justified or unjustified. 
The political climate, it 
seems to me, is to make everybody 
happy we have to have a tax cut. Add 
that tax cut, if you will, to the $1 trillion 
that I have already outlined and 
you see the monumental problem that 
we have on our hands. 

Meanwhile back at the ranch we have 
all kinds of people, well-intentioned 
people, who are saying, ‘‘This has to be 
off limits. Of course that has to be off 
limits. We cannot touch this, we cannot 
touch that.’’ I hope those of us who 
vote for a constitutional amendment to 
balance the budget recognize, as we 
must, that not all of us, maybe not a 
majority of us, will be here serving in 
the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives 
in the year 2002. Yet we 
are mandating what people will do 
then. We, therefore, in my view, have 
the responsibility to plow a straight 
furrow, to tell the people exactly what 
the situation is, to put the pain and 
suffering that is going to take place in 
making these cuts so they are clearly 
understood—to recognize that, of all 
things, we may even have to raise 
taxes sometime before 2002 to accomplish 
the ends we are about to vote for. 
When you mention the tax word around 
here, though, that is a no-no. 

I simply say in tackling this proposition 
this Senator, and I expect two-
thirds of the Senate, are strongly in 
support of and will pass a constitutional 
amendment to balance the budget. 
We have the responsibility, not only 
to vote but we have the responsibility 

to fully understand what we are tackling 
and what we are taking on. Therefore, 
I want to make the point that 
this S. 9 is a far-reaching measure. It 
has to be passed, I believe, to bring 
some sanity to the Federal Government, 
to begin to balance income with 
out-go. Therefore it is a necessity. It is 
a very, very painful one and the people 
of the United States who send us here 
to do their bidding should understand 
when we do what they want us to do— 
the vast majority want a constitutional 
amendment to balanced the 
budget. I say to the people of the United 
States of America, it is not going to 
be easy. I am afraid too many believe if 
we just eliminate the $1,200 toilet seats 
and the $500 hammer, and if we cut the 
salaries of the Members of the House 
and Senate and their staffs in half, we 
could do those things and everything 
would take care of itself. It would be 
balanced. 

I heard a big debate on television last 
night about $300 million for public 
radio and public television. That is 
what television shows are made of. The 
$300 million that we spend on public 
broadcasting maybe should be cut. But 
it is a drop in the bucket. And we continue 
to focus on the little things, 
making believe if we do that, the problem 
is solved. It is a monumental problem 
of major proportions that all 
should understand, as we proceed down 
this dangerous course that in my view 
we must proceed on if we are ever 
going to bring outlays in line with expenditures.

SENATOR DASCHLE’S IMPORTANT 

MESSAGES TO THE AMERICAN 

PUBLIC 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, at the beginning 
of every session of Congress 
the Senate, both the minority and the 
majority, introduce five bills. These 
are deemed to be the most important 
bills of the two parties during a Congress. 
I would like to congratulate and 
applaud the minority leader, Senator 
DASCHLE of South Dakota, for the 
choice he made in the bills that are 
part of the legislation that will be addressed 
by this Congress. The bills he 
has introduced are important messages 
to the American public. 

I first want to talk about S. 6. This is 
a bill dealing with the American work


ing class. It is called the Working 
Americans Opportunity Act. We have 
made great strides, these past couple of 
years, in creating new jobs. Over 5 million 
new jobs have been created. We 
have the lowest inflation rate since 
John Kennedy was President. Three 
years in a row we have had a deficit reduction. 
We will have a reduction in 
our annual deficit this year, the third 
year in a row. This is the first time in 
50 years this has happened. 

Industrial production is the highest 
since the days of President Lyndon 
Baines Johnson. Real business investment 
is the highest since World War II. 

Mr. President, we have 100,000 fewer 
Federal employees than we had years 
ago. Corporate profits soared 45 percent 
in the last quarter. Productivity as I 
indicated is skyrocketing. 

What then is the problem? The problem 
is that the American public generally 
is not benefiting from the gains 
that are being made. 

Let me read from a speech that was 
given by the Secretary of Labor very 
recently. He said among other things, 
and I quote: 

The old middle class has become an anxious 
class—worried not only about sustaining 
their incomes but also about keeping 
their jobs and their health insurance. Our 
large corporations continue to improve productivity 
by investing in technology and 
cutting payrolls. In a recent survey three 
out of four employers say their own employees 
fear losing their jobs. Meanwhile, 1994 is 
on track to become history’s second-biggest 
year for mergers and acquisitions. But who 
wins in this $300 billion deal? Certainly not 
the average American worker. When two industry 
giants merge, the advantages of the 
deal often come from layoffs. Across America, 
I hear the same refrain: ‘‘I’ve given this 
company the best years of my life, and now 
they dispose of me like a piece of rusted machinery.’’ 
What has happened to the men and 
women who have lost their jobs? Some have 
navigated their way to new and better opportunities. 
But nearly one out of five who lost 
a full-time job since 1991 is still without 
work. And among those Americans who have 
landed new jobs, almost half—47 percent 
—are now earning less than they did before. 

In sum, tens of millions of middle-class 
Americans continue to experience what they 
began to face in the late 1970’s—downward 
mobility. They know that recoveries are cyclical, 
but fear that the underlying trend is 
permanent. They voted for change in ’94 just 
as they voted for change in ’92, and they will 
do it again and again until they feel that 
downward slide is reversing. But what so 
many Americans find shocking about today’s 
economy is the seeming randomness of their 
fates. 

On a recent poll, 55 percent of American 
adults said they no longer believe that you 
can build a better life for yourself and your 
family by working hard and playing by the 
rules. Of those without college degrees, 68 
percent no longer believe it. Because they 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 25 

have been working hard and they are still 
falling behind. 

Mr. President, sure things are happening. 
Corporate profits are up 45 percent, 
and I am happy. That is the way 
it should be. We have added new jobs. 
But the problem is, I repeat, the middle 
class is not benefiting from what is 
taking place. That is why we had the 
vote in 1992 that was a minirevolution, 
and a vote in 1994 that was an outright 
revolution. People of the middle class 
that make up the vast majority of the 
people of this country are dissatisfied 
with what is going on. 

Last year alone the top 20 percent of 
American households took home a 
record 48 percent of this Nation’s total 
income. This same group, the top 20 
percent of American households, pocketed 
72 percent of the growth in incomes 
that took place. The top 5 percent 
of people who work in America 
took home 20 percent of the Nation’s 
total income and more than 40 percent 
of all the growth that took place in income 
in this country. We know about 
rising interest rates that are also hitting 
the middle class with higher car 
payments, mortgages, and credit card 
payments. 

Mr. President, men who lack a college 
degree—nearly three out of four 
working men—have suffered a decline 
in average real income since 1979 and 
women have just barely stayed even. 

So as to the bill, the Working Americans 
Opportunity Act, I will not repeat 
what my colleague from Louisiana, 
Senator BREAUX, said, but I believe, as 
Senator BREAUX believes, that it is one 
of the most important pieces of legislation 
introduced in these Chambers in 
decades. Why? Because it is directly related 
to the American middle class. 
The bill will take bold steps, Mr. President, 
to complete the responsibility for 
economic viability for all American 
citizens. The bill will replace nine Federal 
job training programs. I mentioned 
nine job training programs. 
Each of these job training programs 
have a series of subcategories under 
them, dozens, as Senator BREAUX said. 
Many of them are not relevant to the 
people that are coming to them seeking 
help. We want to replace these nine 
Federal job training programs with a 
new training account system for working 
Americans. 

Mr. President, the vast majority of 
the people in America do not go to college. 
There is nothing wrong with that. 
I am not going to get into a debate 
about how our high schools only generally 
push college courses. I think 
that we should be more in tune with 
what people want and need in this 
country. But suffice it to say, the vast 
majority of people in this country do 
not go to college. We need people that 
do not go to college to be able to compete 
in the modern-day American 
workplace, and many people are not. 
They are being lost in the cracks. They 
go to find help from an agency that is 
supposed to help them and retrain 
them. They have lost jobs. They do not 

have a job. They are lost. The job agencies 
simply do not give them the help 
they need. 

These workers will be given a voucher. 
It is not welfare. We will save 
money in this program. Instead of giving 
this money to a Government bureaucrat 
we will give the money to an 
individual. That individual can look 
around and find a program that is in 
keeping with what they should do, 
what they want to do. 

Mr. President, this is the way that 
we used to do things. We should now 
again take up what worked before. 

They will receive training vouchers 
for job training and employment-related 
services. This legislation will offer 
workers who seek assistance a list of 
State-certified places to obtain job 
training and employment services. The 
places they will go will have been certified, 
and they will have a report card, 
so to speak, to indicate their success 
and failures. 

It will establish through Federal 
grant programs to States a one-stop information 
center that provides easy access 
to a full range of job training and 
placement services. It will establish in 
the labor market an information system 
providing current data on available 
jobs and training to help working 
Americans keep pace with the changing 
workplace. 

This legislation should receive bipartisan 
support. I am hopeful and I am 
confident that it will. There is no reason 
that we cannot join together in 
this. It does a number of things. It reduces 
the bureaucracy, returns programs 
to the State level, and gives individuals 
choice in how they are going 
to be able to complete the rest of their 
lives. There will not be meaningless 
programs that they are sent to for retraining. 


So I do hope very much, Mr. President, 
that we can receive bipartisan 
support for this legislation that has 
been introduced by Senator DASCHLE. 

Also part of Senator DASCHLE’s legislation 
is the Family Health Insurance 
Protection Act. We all know that the 
work that was done in the hours and 
days and weeks and months spent on 
this floor and in the other body on 
health care reform bore no fruit. We 
can pass a lot of blame as to why. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that I be allowed to speak for an 
additional 5 minutes. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, if we had to 
pick winners and losers in the health 
care debate, the winner clearly is the 
health insurance industry. They set 
out to confuse and frighten the American 
public, and they did that. I have 
to tell them that I think they did a 
good job. But that does not take away 
from the fact that we still now have 
problems with health care in this country. 


Senator DASCHLE has recognized this 
in his legislation which continues a 
commitment to provide Americans 

with accessible and affordable health 
care by addressing those pressing concerns 
of working families. This legislation 
will clamp down on insurance 
practices that often cause families and 
small businesses to lose their coverage. 

I learned in this health care debate 
that we did not spend enough time trying 
to look out for small businesses. 
This legislation does that. 

The elements in this bill are those 
areas upon which there is I believe, and 
Senator DASCHLE believes, broad bipartisan 
consensus to do some health care 
reform. 

This bill will ensure portability, 
eliminate preexisting conditions exclusions, 
and prohibit companies from 
charging consumers higher rates than 
others with the same policy or raising 
rates after consumers get sick. This 
bill will also require all insurers to 
offer at least one plan that will give 
benefits similar to what Members of 
Congress have. 

Also, I think very important—and I 
believe this is the most important part 
of Senator DASCHLE’s bill—if we pass 
no other part, we should pass the part 
that says: This bill will return buying 
power to consumers by requiring 
health care providers, health plans, to 
make cost and quality information 
available to consumers so they can 
compare plans and make informed 
choices about the coverage. 

We would require that the health 
care providers, in effect, have a report 
card so consumers can make an intelligent 
choice. We want to also reduce 
paperwork and have administrative 
simplification and reform of malpractice. 
I believe this is another piece 
of legislation on which we can join 
with our neighbors across the aisle and 
reform health care in America today. 

Another piece of legislation is the 
Teen Pregnancy Prevention and Parent 
Responsibility Act. I am concerned 
about this issue. I am not proud of the 
fact, but the State of Nevada, in 1990, 
ranked No. 2 in the Nation in teenage 
pregnancy rates. There is only one 
other State in the Union that has a 
higher teenage pregnancy rate than the 
State of Nevada. 

We have to address welfare reform 
generally. This legislation does this, 
with emphasis on the problems we have 
with teen pregnancy and establishes 
parent responsibility. We must have 
the parents of these children responsible 
for their well-being. 

It is important to note, Mr. President, 
that 70 percent of births to teenage 
mothers were fathered by men who 
were 21 years of age and older. They 
should pay and be responsible. We 
know what is going on in our country 
today. It is devastating and it is hurting 
the moral fabric of this country. 
This legislation addresses that. 

Because of the lack of time, I am not 
going to go into detail, but I say to my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
that this is the third piece of legislation 
I have talked about today where 
we should have bipartisan support. 


S 26 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

Senator EXON talked about joining the 
Republican colleagues on the balanced 
budget amendment. We need to do 
that. 

The last part of the legislation that 
the minority leader introduced as part 
of the Democratic legislation is congressional 
coverage reform. It is important 
that we deal with Senate coverage. 
We are going to do that. That is 
going to be a bipartisan effort. I 
worked as chairman of a task force last 
year to report to the majority leader, 
and then the minority leader Senator 
DOLE, and I think much that we did on 
the bipartisan task force is going to be 
part of the legislation. Lobbying reform, 
gift ban and campaign finance reform 
are a part of Senator DASCHLE’s 
legislation. I recommend it to my colleagues 
on this side and the other side 
of the aisle and say to the American 
public I think this is the year we are 
going to accomplish something 
through teamwork. 

Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Mississippi. 

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have been 
pleased to listen to the statement of 
the distinguished Senator from Nevada, 
and I am very encouraged to hear 
his comments. I am satisfied that there 
are going to be many issues we will 
work together on, and I believe there 
are going to be many opportunities for 
cooperation in a bipartisan way this 
year. 

I want to commend our new Republican 
majority leader for scheduling as 
the first piece of legislation we will 
take up the Congressional Accountability 
Act. We will have bipartisan support 
for that effort, and I think it is 
appropriate that we begin this year by 
saying we are going to have all the 
Federal laws that apply to the American 
people—in the States of Nevada, 
Tennessee, Mississippi, all across the 
country, apply to us also. So we will 
begin that debate on the first full legislative 
day of this year, and hopefully 
we will be able to reach an early agreement 
and pass that legislation quickly—
perhaps in the next 2 days, or certainly 
by early next week. I look forward 
to working with the Senator from 
Nevada and others. I yield to the Senator 
from Nevada. 

Mr. REID. I say to the Senator, my 
friend from Mississippi, through the 
Chair, that I congratulate him on his 
recent leadership position. I am glad to 
see that my former colleague from the 
House is doing well. He had good training 
there. I served in the House when 
the Senator from Mississippi was minority 
whip. He did a fine job there, as 
I am sure he will do here. I wish him 
the very best in this Congress. 

Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from New Jersey is recognized. 

Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be permitted 
to proceed as if in morning business for 
5 minutes. 

Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, 
Mr. President. 

Just for clarification, under a previous 
unanimous-consent agreement, 
there was a time agreement, I believe, 
for an hour and 20 minutes on each 
side. What is the present status of that 
time? All time has expired on the minority 
side. How much time is remaining 
on the majority side? 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority 
has 28 minutes and 16 seconds, 
and the minority is out of time. 

Mr. LOTT. And when all time is used 
or yielded back, is the next order of 
business a statement by the Senator 
from Iowa [Mr. HARKIN], on his amendment? 


The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next 
order of business would be to resume 
consideration of Senate Resolution 14. 

Mr. LOTT. I thank you, Mr. President. 


I withdraw my reservation. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
is recognized for 5 minutes. 

Mr. BRADLEY. I thank the Chair. 

(The remarks of Mr. BRADLEY pertaining 
to the introduction of legislation 
are located in today’s RECORD 
under ‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills 
and Joint Resolutions.’’) 

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. WARNER). 
The clerk will call the roll. 

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I may speak 
for up to 10 minutes as in morning 
business. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 

f 


TAX CUT—WRONG THING TO DO 

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the 
bipartisan stampede for tax cuts begins 
here in the 104th Congress, I would like 
to raise a dissenting voice. Like every 
other elected official, I would really 
like to be able to support a tax cut for 
middle-class Americans. In fact, it 
would be great to be able to support a 
tax cut for all Americans. That is usually 
a very pleasant opportunity for an 
elected official to vote for that kind of 
tax cut. 

I think it is the wrong thing to do 
right now, when we have just begun to 
make headway on reducing the Federal 
deficit. This new tax cut fever is just 
the most recent example of how far we 
seem to be straying in the path toward 
economic stability. We started moving 
in the right direction with deficit reduction 
in 1993, but I think in 1994, we 
started to stray from the path a little. 
Now, there are just far too many signs 
that not only are we straying from the 
path, but that we are about to make a 

complete U-turn and head back toward 
soaring deficits, a mounting national 
debt, and putting off until tomorrow 
the fiscal housecleaning that is so desperately 
needed today. Let me just tick 
off very quickly some of the bad signs 
that we are about to move in the wrong 
direction. 

One is that the Republican Contract 
With America, frankly, lays out what I 
think is an irresponsible plan that proposes 
a balanced Federal budget and, at 
the same time, says we are going to 
have major tax cuts and a significant 
increase in military spending. This is a 
proposal that Nixon’s economic adviser, 
Herbert Stein, labeled hypocritical. 
So that is one sign—the Republican 
contract. 

The second sign is that some folks 
are also saying we should use something 
called dynamic scoring techniques. 
I think this dynamic scoring 
technique is a bit of fiscal hocus-pocus. 
Business Week described it this way: 

* * * as the most dangerous thing to hit 
Washington since politicians discovered how 
to print money. 

Dynamic scoring would abandon the 
tough pay-as-you-go budget rules that 
we have used in the past several years 
to bring down the Federal deficit. So I 
think that is a bad idea. In fact, we 
have seen voodoo economics in the 
past. I see this as voodoo mathematics. 

Just so it is clear this is not just a 
partisan statement by any means, 
there is a third sign that we are moving 
in the wrong direction, and that is 
that President Clinton himself has proposed 
a $25 billion increase in spending 
for a military budget that, in my view, 
is already bloated with obsolete, cold-
war-era weapons systems. 

Another sign: Members of both parties 
in this Senate just voted to waive 
the budget rules for the GATT implementing 
legislation. There are many 
other merits to it, but the fact is the 
measure does not offset the cost of the 
loss of tariffs of some $40 billion over 
the next 10 years. So much of the 
progress we made on reducing the deficit 
could be lost because of the failure 
to pay for the GATT agreement. 

The same goes, finally, for the proposal, 
the reaction to the Kerrey-Danforth 
Commission. People essentially 
ignore the important message that all 
things have to be on the table. Both 
discretionary spending and entitlements 
have to be on the table. You 
cannot have it only defense spending, 
only discretionary spending, or only 
entitlements if we are going to attack 
the deficit. 

But perhaps the greatest risk to our 
efforts on the Federal deficit is the latest 
effort to try to come up with these 
tax cuts. That frenzy of tax cuts, particularly 
creating the tax breaks for 
special interests, gave us the biggest 
deficit in our history, a deficit that we 
have just begun to cut, with considerable 
pain and sacrifice for Americans. I 
do not think our economy can sustain 
another round of this political self-indulgence. 



January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 27 

Mr. President, if the Federal Reserve 
reacts as anticipated and pushes interest 
rates up again, the economy could 
very well go through the windshield, 
and right now the President’s proposed 
tax credit for families with incomes up 
to $75,000 will cost $90 billion over 10 
years, and if you throw in the tax cuts 
he has proposed, the bill reaches $174 
billion. The Republican proposal to 
give tax credits for families earning up 
to $200,000 will cost, Mr. President, $244 
billion over 10 years, and altogether 
the Republican contract, I am told, 
would cost a whopping $712 billion over 
the next 10 years. 

So, Mr. President, I think the conventional 
wisdom about tax cuts is 
something that has to be challenged. I 
realize not many people are doing it at 
this time. What I am noticing is that 
my constituents can smell a rat when 
someone suggests that a tax cut is just 
what the Nation needs right now. 

It was not that long ago that I had a 
chance, as a candidate for U.S. Senate, 
to oppose a middle-class tax cut in a 
campaign. My opponents in the general 
election spent a lot of time and money 
making sure everybody in the State 
knew I was against the middle-class 
tax cut. But the voters realized that 
what they would get back in lower 
taxes, a meaningful amount to many 
people, was simply not worth it because 
of the devastation it would cause 
to our Federal budget. 

Let me bring it right up to today. In 
my office, since the President made his 
speech, phone calls and letters have 
been running about 10 to 1 in favor of 
reducing the deficit rather than using 
spending cuts to cut taxes. 

For example, a gentleman from 
Birnamwood, WI, wrote to me and said: 

By all means, cut Government spending 
but use that savings to eliminate the deficit 
and pay down the debt that threatens to 
overwhelm us. 

He said that is the only responsible 
thing to do. 

A woman from Cornucopia, WI, the 
most northern point in Wisconsin, 
wrote: 

I can’t figure out why this is happening, 
this race to cut taxes, when the majority of 
people, according to all I have seen, heard, 
and read, don’t care. 

She says: 

We wanted the deficit cut and we wanted 
our money spent more wisely. 

A gentleman from Waupaca, a very 
Republican town in Wisconsin, wrote 
this to me. He said recently: 

I want you to know that I strongly support 
your position against the proposed tax cuts. 
With an income of $50,000, I guess I would 
benefit from most of the tax cut plans, but I 
feel the benefit would be short lived and 
would be clearly detrimental to the country. 
I hope that you will continue to oppose these 
tax-cut plans that are clearly nothing more 
than attempts to buy votes. 

My office, Mr. President, has received 
hundreds of calls and letters 
that are similar to these. And I think 
that view is shared not just in Wisconsin. 
A USA Today-CNN poll published 
on December 20, 1994, found that 70 per


cent of those polled said if Congress is 
able to cut spending, then reducing the 
deficit—reducing the deficit—is a higher 
priority than just giving out tax 
cuts. 

So, Mr. President, to conclude, it is a 
little frustrating to hear constituents 
who could certainly use the money 
urge Congress to make deficit reduction 
a higher priority than tax cuts and 
then see this institution rush to see 
who can give the bigger tax cut. I hope 
the media and the political commentators 
will look closely at the campaign 
rhetoric of those who just recently 
pledged to fight to reduce the Federal 
deficit and compare that rhetoric to today’s 
eagerness to join the bandwagon 
on tax cuts. 

I thank the Chair, and I suggest the 
absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 

Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

f 


PASSAGE OF A PROCOMPETITIVE, 
DEREGULATORY TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
BILL, THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
COMPETITION 
AND DEREGULATION ACT OF 1995 

Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I 
think one of the major duties of the 
new Congress will be to pass a major 
telecommunications reform bill—a new 
procompetitive, deregulatory bill. I 
know there are many views in this 
body on national telecommunications 
policy. The Republican controlled 104th 
Congress has a truly historic opportunity 
to pass comprehensive telecommunications 
reform legislation. 

Last year, the Congress almost 
passed a bill. The House of Representatives 
passed a bill by an overwhelming 
vote. The Senate Commerce Committee 
passed out a bill 18 to 2 that became 
entangled here on the Senate 
floor. 

Why should we pass a telecommunications 
bill in 1995? The reason is that 
the country needs a roadmap for the 
next century in telecommunications as 
we continue to move forward in the Information 
Age. We need to have more 
competition and more deregulation. 
Past efforts to craft telecommunications 
legislation have been bogged 
down by overly regulatory approaches. 
A fresh look at the issues, grounded in 
procompetitive, deregulatory principles, 
is the best way to meet our 
common policy objectives. 

We need to have all telecommunications 
markets open to competition. 
We need to have the cable companies 
competing in the telephone business 
and telephone companies providing 
cable television service. We need to 
have the long-distance companies competing 
in local telephone markets, and 
vice versa. We no longer should have 

this regulatory apartheid scheme of 
having little patches or enclaves of 
competition for only one group of people 
or companies. 

Telecommunications policy in America, 
under the 1934 Communications 
Act, has long been based on the now 
faulty premise that information transmitted 
over wires could easily be distinguished 
from information transmitted 
over the air. Different regulatory 
regimes were erected around different 
information media. That is what I refer 
to as the regulatory apartheid scheme. 

This is an extremely complex and difficult 
area. It is easier said than done. 
The telecommunications field is a 
unique area of regulation in that one 
frequently has to use someone else’s 
coaxial cable to get to a home or someone 
else’s fiber optic cable or someone 
else’s copper cable or copper wire to 
get one’s product delivered. Nonetheless, 
I am quite confident we can work 
out many of those problems through 
the development of opening requirements 
in terms of unbundling, in terms 
of interconnection, in terms of number 
portability, in terms of resale and so 
forth. 

It is my strongest personal conviction 
that one of the great accomplishments, 
on a bipartisan basis, of this 
104th Congress will be the passage of a 
new major telecommunications reform 
bill. 

I have been meeting and speaking 
with numerous CEO’s from around the 
country in the telecommunications and 
information technology industries. I 
am meeting with consumers. I am talking 
with my fellow Republican and 
Democratic colleagues, both in the 
House and the Senate. I have spoken on 
a number of occasions with Vice President 
GORE about this most important 
topic. We must work together on a bipartisan 
basis to achieve this laudable 
goal. 

Much of the recent discussion around 
the country has been about the Contract 
With America and some of the 
partisanship that might surround that 
debate. I think the contract is a very 
healthy thing and I will vote for it. But 
we will also have a substantial piece of 
substantive legislation in the Commerce 
Committee this year—a new pro-
competitive, deregulatory telecommunications 
bill—the Telecommunications 
Competition and Deregulation 
Act of 1995. As the incoming 
chairman of the Senate Commerce 
Committee this year I have announced 
that this will be the Commerce Committee’s 
top priority. I ask my colleagues 
to look at some of the materials 
we will send to your offices on 
this bill. It is very important that we 
reach consensus on this critically important 
issue and pass a new telecommunications 
bill. 

My new telecommunications bill will 
rapidly accelerate private sector deployment 
of advanced telecommunications 
and information technologies 
and services to all Americans by open

ing all telecommunications markets to 
competition. It will markedly improve 
international competitiveness, spur 
economic growth, job creation and productivity 
gains, delivery better quality 
of life through more efficient delivery 
of educational, health care and other 
social services, and enhance individual 
empowerment. All without spending 
taxpayer money. 

Mr. President, I thank the Chair and 
I yield the floor. I note the absence of 
a quorum.

clerk will call the roll. 

The legislative clerk proceeded to

THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I intend 
to introduce legislation very early in 
this Congress that will address some of 
the most serious deficiencies in our 
civil justice system. Litigation today 
is an extraordinarily expensive mechanism 
for compensating an injured 
party. The seriously injured victim in 
Utah and in all of our States is often 
not compensated fairly, and frequently 
there is an unconscionable delay in 
one’s recovery. 
In other instances, trial lawyers sue 
too easily, and often with no consequence 
for their unmeritorious position, 
knowing that the high cost of defending 
against even an unworthy 
claim will often induce at least a nuisance 
settlement. 
The uncertainty of an excessive punitive 
damage award by a runaway jury 
cripples our business community and 
diverts resources that could be better 
used for research and employment. 
Moreover, the current joint liability 
laws make each defendant with any 
culpability liable for the entire amount 
of damages regardless of the degree of 
their culpability. Thus, for example, a 
defendant who is only 10 percent responsible 
for a wrong can wind up paying 
100 percent of the damages. 
Many defendants are unfairly held responsible 
for damages because those 
primarily responsible are uninsured or 
outside of the jurisdiction of the 
courts. Junk science has made a mockery 
out of our system of justice, leading 
juries to make unfair decisions in 
some cases. 
In sum, we now have a civil justice 
system wherein true victims face unreasonable 
delay in receiving compensation 
for wrongs done to them, 
compensation which is often less than 
full, in any event. At the same time, 
the civil justice system imposes an 
enormous cost on society as a whole. 
The great expense of litigating against 
meritless claims, the unfair allocation 
of liability, the threat of unfair, excessive 
damage awards, collectively drive 
up the cost of doing business. This cost 

is ultimately passed on to the 
consumer, and deters the development 
of new and worthwhile products and 
services. 

I support a number of legal reforms 
that will improve our civil justice system, 
make the system fairer to all parties, 
allow for a quicker recovery for 
those injured, and make those most responsible 
for an injury liable for their 
fair share. I welcome the input of those 
concerned about these issues. 

I am also committed to joining Senators 
GORTON and ROCKEFELLER in 
passing product liability reform legislation 
in the 104th Congress. I look forward 
to their continued leadership in 
the Commerce Committee in that important 
effort. I hope that my efforts 
to enact civil justice reform legislation 
will complement the products liability 
legislation.

TRIBUTE TO C.G. NUCKOLS 

Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I rise 
to pay tribute to one of the original 
staff members of the Congressional 
Budget Office, C.G. Nuckols. Mr. 
Nuckols has served the Congress at 
CBO for almost 20 years, most recently 
as Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. 
He is retiring today to begin a 
new career in the private sector. 

C.G. Nuckols began his Federal service 
in 1963 as an operations research 
analyst for the Department of the 
Navy. From there he moved to the Office 
of the Secretary of Defense, where 
he became Director of the Program 
Cost Analysis Division. In recognition 
of his efforts, he was awarded the Defense 
Meritorious Civilian Service 
Medal. Soon after CBO started operations 
in 1975, Alice Rivlin and James 
Blum persuaded Mr. Nuckols to leave 
the Defense Department to help establish 
CBO’s Budget Analysis Division. 
Every Member and every committee 
of the Congress relies on the work of 
the Budget Analysis Division. We on 
the Appropriations Committee expect 
our appropriation bills to be scored 
overnight—or sooner. The Budget Committee 
depends on the division for help 
in preparing the functional totals and 
committee spending allocations for the 
budget resolution. And the authorizing 
committees routinely receive timely 
CBO cost estimates for virtually all reported 
bills. 

Although the Congress now takes all 
of these things for granted, it was not 
always so. In 1975, CBO was a blank 
slate. Together with James Blum, C.G. 
Nuckols established the rules, formats, 
and procedures for preparing budget 
projections and bill cost estimates. He 
made sure that work was completed on 
time, that analyses were carefully justified, 
and that precedents were scrupulously 
followed—whether the estimate 
was for a freshman or a powerful 
chairman. 

Yet if there is one item above all for 
which we have C.G. Nuckols to thank, 
it is for the quality of the budget analysis 
staff at CBO. From 1975 to today, 

Mr. Nuckols has personally interviewed 
almost everyone hired by the Budget 
Analysis Division. Only those who 
meet his high standards of integrity, 
intellect, and training pass muster. 
Then, having hired the best, he has 
worked to ensure that they had the resources 
and support necessary to perform 
at their best. 

Mr. President, the appreciation we 
feel for the work of the Congressional 
Budget Office is due in no small part to 
the efforts of C.G. Nuckols. During his 
20 years at CBO, Mr. Nuckols has 
served the Congress with quiet, tireless, 
nonpartisan professionalism. I 
wish him well in his new venture, 
knowing that he leaves behind at CBO 
a staff that will continue the tradition 
he did so much to establish.

BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT 

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I 
hereby submit to the Senate the budget 
scorekeeping report prepared by the 
Congressional Budget Office under section 
308(b) and in aid of section 311 of 
the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, 
as amended. This report meets the requirements 
for Senate scorekeeping of 
section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 
32, the first concurrent resolution 
on the budget for 1986. 

This report shows the effects of congressional 
action on the budget 
through December 1, 1994. The estimates 
of budget authority, outlays, 
and revenues, which are consistent 
with the technical and economic assumptions 
of the concurrent resolution 
on the budget (H. Con. Res. 218), show 
that current level spending is below 
the budget resolution by $2.3 billion in 
budget authority and $0.4 billion in 
outlays. Current level is $0.8 billion 
over the revenue floor in 1995 and below 
by $8.2 billion over the 5 years 1995–99. 
The current estimate of the deficit for 
purposes of calculating the maximum 
deficit amount is $238.7 billion, $2.3 billion 
below the maximum deficit 
amount for 1995 of $241 billion. 

This is my first report for the first 
session of the 104th Congress. 

There being no objection, the report 
was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 

U.S. CONGRESS, 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, 
Washington, DC, January 4, 1995. 

Hon. PETE DOMENICI, 

Chairman, Committee on the Budget, 

U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The attached report 
for fiscal year 1995 shows the effects of Congressional 
action on the 1995 budget and is 
current through December 1, 1994. The estimates 
of budget authority, outlays and revenues 
are consistent with the technical economic 
assumptions of the 1995 Concurrent 
Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 218). 
This report is submitted under Section 308(b) 
and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional 
Budget Act, as amended, and meets the requirements 
of Senate scorekeeping of Section 
5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the 1986 First Concurrent 
Resolution on the Budget. 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 29 

This is my first report for the first session 
of the 104th Congress.

WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? 
THE VOTERS SAID YES 

Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I doubt 
that there have been many, if any, candidates 
for the Senate who have not 
pledged to do something about the 
enormous Federal debt run up by the 
Congress during the past half-century 
or more. But the Congress, both House 
and Senate, have never even toned 
down, let alone put an end to, the deficit 
spending that has sent the Federal 
debt into the stratosphere and beyond. 

Mr. President, we must pray that 
this year will be different, that Federal 
spending will indeed be reduced drastically. 
Indeed, if we care about America’s 
future, there must be some 
changes. 

You see, Mr. President, as of the 
close of business yesterday, January 3, 
the Federal debt stood—down to the 
penny—at exactly $4,798,116,945,333.39. 
This means that on a per capita basis, 
every man, woman, and child in America 
owes $18,213.73 as his or her share of 
the Federal debt. 

Compare this, Mr. President, to the 
total debt about 2 years ago, January 5, 
1993, when the debt stood at exactly 
$4,167,872,986,853.67—or averaged out, 
$15,986.56 for every American. During 
the past 2 years—that is during the 
103d Congress—the Federal debt increased 
by a total of $630,243,958,749.72. 

This illustrates, Mr. President, the 
point that so many politicians talk a 
good game—at home—about bringing 
the Federal debt under control, but 
vote in support of bloated spending 
bills when they get back to Washington. 
If the Republicans do not do a better 
job of getting a handle on this enormous 
debt, their constituents are not 
likely to overlook it 2 years hence.

IN HONOR OF RAMON RIVERA, RE


TIRING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 

OF LA CASA DE DON PEDRO 

Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, on November 
9, 1994, a very special man, 
Ramon Rivera, retired as executive director 
of the community based organization, 
La Casa de Don Pedro. After 25 
years of public service, he was honored 
for his lifetime commitment to improving 
the lives of individuals and 
families in some of New Jersey’s poorest 
neighborhoods. 

La Casa de Don Pedro was founded by 
Ramon Rivera as Familias Unidas in 
1971. It functioned as a resource for 
Hispanic families to find adequate 
child care and employment opportunities 
in Newark. Through the 1970’s, 
1980’s, and 1990’s La Casa blossomed 
into one of the largest community 
based organizations in New Jersey. Its 
services include child care, assistance 
for senior citizens, and job retraining. 
La Casa’s most notable achievements 
include building low-income two-family 
housing units and town houses for 
the residents of Newark. La Casa also 
developed a credit union that has 
loaned $2.2 million to residents. If it 
were not for the credit union, many of 
the community residents would have 
no place to deposit money, secure 
small loans, or take advantage of services 
we often take for granted. 

Ramon Rivera, born in Puerto Rico, 
came to this country at the age of 12. 
He began his long career in community 
service as an organizer for the National 
Welfare Rights Organization, assisting 
Latina and non-Latina women seek 
food and clothing. He was then founder

Ramon Rivera created an island of 
hope in a community that lacked access 
to opportunities and equity. He developed 
a vibrant social service organization 
that has served almost two generations 
of New Jersey residents. While 
his retirement will be a great loss for 
those who have worked with him and 
for those he has served, he has left an 
exemplary legacy of philanthropic effort 
and commitment.

CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe, 
after consultation with both sides of 
the aisle, we are prepared now to yield 
back the remainder of our time of the 
1 hour and 20 minutes we had. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
has that right and morning business 
is concluded. 

f 


AMENDING PARAGRAPH 2 OF 
RULE XXV 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will now report the pending business. 


The legislative clerk read as follows: 

A resolution (S. Res. 14) amending paragraph 
2 of Rule XXV. 

The Senate continued with the consideration 
of the resolution. 

AMENDMENT NO. 1 
(Purpose: To amend the Standing Rules of 
the Senate to permit cloture to be invoked 
by a decreasing majority vote of Senators 

down to a majority of all Senators duly 

chosen and sworn) 

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send 
an amendment to the desk and ask for 
its immediate consideration. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will report. 

The legislative clerk read as follows: 

The Senator from Iowa [Mr. HARKIN] for 
himself, Mr. LIEBERMAN, Mr. PELL, and Mr. 
ROBB, proposes an amendment numbered 1. 

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that reading of the 
amendment be dispensed with. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

The amendment is as follows: 

At the appropriate place, insert the following: 


SEC. ll. SENATE CLOTURE PROVISION. 

Paragraph 2 of rule XXII of the Standing 
Rules of the Senate is amended to read as 
follows: 

‘‘2. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of 
rule II or rule IV or any other rule of the 
Senate, at any time a motion signed by sixteen 
Senators, to bring to a close the debate 
upon any measure, motion, other matter 

out debate, submit to the Senate by a yea-
and-nay vote the question: ‘‘Is it the sense of 
the Senate that the debate shall be brought 
to a close?’’ And if that question shall be decided 
in the affirmative by three-fifths of the 
Senators duly chosen and sworn—except on a 
measure or motion to amend the Senate 
rules, in which case the necessary affirmative 
vote shall be two-thirds of the Senators 
present and voting—then said measure, motion, 
or other matter pending before the Senate, 
or the unfinished business, shall be the 
unfinished business to the exclusion of all 
other business until disposed of. 

‘‘Thereafter no Senator shall be entitled to 
speak in all more than one hour on the measure, 
motion, or other matter pending before 
the Senate, or the unfinished business, the 
amendments thereto, and motions affecting 
the same, and it shall be the duty of the Presiding 
Officer to keep the time of each Senator 
who speaks. Except by unanimous consent, 
no amendment shall be proposed after 
the vote to bring the debate to a close, unless 
it had been submitted in writing to the 
Journal Clerk by 1 o’clock p.m. on the day 
following the filing of the cloture motion if 
an amendment in the first degree, and unless 
it had been so submitted at least one hour 
prior to the beginning of the cloture vote if 
an amendment in the second degree. No dilatory 
motion, or dilatory amendment, or 
amendment not germane shall be in order. 
Points of order, including questions of relevancy, 
and appeals from the decision of the 
Presiding Officer, shall be decided without 
debate. 

‘‘After no more than thirty hours of consideration 
of the measure, motion, or other 
matter on which cloture has been invoked, 
the Senate shall proceed, without any further 
debate on any question, to vote on the 
final disposition thereof to the exclusion of 
all amendments not then actually pending 
before the Senate at that time and to the exclusion 
of all motions, except a motion to 
table, or to reconsider and one quorum call 
on demand to establish the presence of a 
quorum (and motions required to establish a 
quorum) immediately before the final vote 
begins. The thirty hours may be increased by 
the adoption of a motion, decided without 
debate, by a three-fifths affirmative vote of 
the Senators duly chosen and sworn, and any 
such time thus agreed upon shall be equally 
divided between and controlled by the Majority 
and Minority Leaders or their designees. 
However, only one motion to extend time, 
specified above, may be made in any one calendar 
day. 

‘‘If, for any reason, a measure or matter is 
reprinted after cloture has been invoked, 
amendments which were in order prior to the 
reprinting of the measure or matter will continue 
to be in order and may be conformed 
and reprinted at the request of the amendment’s 
sponsor. The conforming changes 
must be limited to lineation and pagination. 

‘‘No Senator shall call up more than two 
amendments until every other Senator shall 
have had the opportunity to do likewise. 

‘‘Notwithstanding other provisions of this 
rule, a Senator may yield all or part of his 
one hour to the majority or minority floor 
managers of the measure, motion, or matter 
or to the Majority or Minority Leader, but 
each Senator specified shall not have more 

posed amendment has been identified and 
has been available in printed form at the 
desk of the Members for not less than twenty-
four hours. 

‘‘(b)(1) If, upon a vote taken on a motion 
presented pursuant to subparagraph (a), the 
Senate fails to invoke cloture with respect 
to a measure, motion, or other matter pending 
before the Senate, or the unfinished business, 
subsequent motions to bring debate to 
a close may be made with respect to the 
same measure, motion, matter, or unfinished 
business. It shall not be in order to file subsequent 
cloture motions on any measure, 
motion, or other matter pending before the 
Senate, except by unanimous consent, until 
the previous motion has been disposed of. 

‘‘(2) Such subsequent motions shall be 
made in the manner provided by, and subject 
to the provisions of, subparagraph (a), except 
that the affirmative vote required to bring 
to a close debate upon that measure, motion, 
or other matter, or unfinished business 
(other than a measure or motion to amend 
Senate rules) shall be reduced by three votes 
on the second such motion, and by three additional 
votes on each succeeding motion, 
until the affirmative vote is reduced to a 
number equal to or less than an affirmative 
vote of a majority of the Senators duly chosen 
and sworn. The required vote shall then 
be an affirmative vote of a majority of the 
Senators duly chosen and sworn. The requirement 
of an affirmative vote of a majority 
of the Senators duly chosen and sworn 
shall not be further reduced upon any vote 
taken on any later motion made pursuant to 
this subparagraph with respect to that measure, 
motion, matter, or unfinished business.’’ 

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for the 
benefit of the Senators who are here 
and watching on the monitors, we now 
have before us an amendment by myself, 
Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator 
PELL, and Senator ROBB that would 
amend rule XXII, the so-called filibuster 
rule of the U.S. Senate. This is 
an amendment that was agreed upon— 
at least the procedure was agreed upon 
for this amendment—between Senator 
DOLE and myself earlier today under a 
unanimous consent agreement. 

This amendment would change the 
way this Senate operates more fundamentally 
than anything that has 
been proposed thus far this year. It 
would fundamentally change the way 
we do business by changing the filibuster 
rule as it currently stands. 

Mr. President, the last Congress 
showed us the destructive impact filibusters 
can have on the legislative 
process, provoking gridlock after 
gridlock, frustration, anger, and despondency 
among the American people, 
wondering whether we can get anything 
done at all here in Washington. 
The pattern of filibusters and delays 
that we saw in the last Congress is part 
of the rising tide of filibusters that 
have overwhelmed our legislative process. 



January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 31 

While some may gloat and glory in 
the frustration and anger that the 
American people felt toward our institution 
which resulted in the tidal wave 
of dissatisfaction that struck the majority 
in Congress, I believe in the long 
run that it will harm the Senate and 
our Nation for this pattern to continue. 
As this chart shows, Mr. President, 
there has indeed been a rising 
tide in the use of the filibuster. In the 
last two Congresses, in 1987 to 1990, and 
1991 to 1994, there have been twice as 
many filibusters per year as there were 
the last time the Republicans controlled 
the Senate, from 1981 to 1986, 
and 10 times as many as occurred between 
1917 and 1960. Between 1917 and 
1960, there were an average of 1.3 per 
session. However, in the last Congress, 
there were 10 times that many. This is 
not healthy for our legislative process 
and it is not healthy for our country. 

The second chart I have here compares 
filibusters in the entire 19th century 
and in the last Congress. We had 
twice as many filibusters in the 103d 
Congress as we had in the entire 100 
years of the 19th century. 

Clearly, this is a process that is out 
of control. We need to change the rules. 
We need to change the rules, however, 
without harming the longstanding Senate 
tradition of extended debate and 
deliberation, and slowing things down. 

The third chart I have here shows the 
issues that were subject to filibusters 
in the last Congress. Some of these 
were merely delayed by filibusters. 
Others were killed outright, despite 
having the majority of both bodies and 
the President in favor of them. That is 
right. Some of these measures had a 
majority of support in the Senate and 
in the House, and by the President. 
Yet, they never saw the light of day. 
Others simply were perfunctory housekeeping 
types of issues. 

For example, one might understand 
why someone would filibuster the 
Brady Handgun Act. There were people 
that felt very strongly opposed to that. 
I can understand that being slowed 
down, and having extended debate on 
it. Can you say that about the J. Larry 
Lawrence nomination? I happen to be a 
personal friend of Mr. Lawrence. He is 
now our Ambassador to Switzerland, 
an important post. He was nominated 
to be Ambassador there, and he came 
through the committee fine. Yet, his 
nomination was the subject of a filibuster. 
Or there was the Edward P. 
Berry, Jr., nomination. There was the 
Claude Bolton nomination. You get my 
point. 

We had nominations that were filibustered. 
This was almost unheard of 
in our past. We filibustered the nomination 
of a person that actually came 
through the committee process and 
was approved by the committee, and it 
was filibustered here on the Senate 
floor. 

Actually, Senators use these nominations 
as a lever for power. If one Senator 
has an issue where he or she wants 
something done, it is very easy. All a 

Senator needs to do is filibuster a nomination. 
Then the majority leader or 
the minority leader has to come to the 
Senator and say, ‘‘Would you release 
your hold on that, give up your filibuster 
on that?’’ 

‘‘OK,’’ the Senator will reply. ‘‘What 
do you want in return?’’ 

Then the deals are struck. 

It is used, Mr. President, as blackmail 
for one Senator to get his or her 
way on something that they could not 
rightfully win through the normal 
processes. I am not accusing any one 
party of this. It happens on both sides 
of the aisle. 

Mr. President, I believe each Senator 
needs to give up a little of our pride, a 
little of our prerogatives, and a little 
of our power for the good of this Senate 
and for the good of this country. Let 
me repeat that: Each Senator, I believe, 
has to give up a little of our 
pride, a little of our prerogatives, and a 
little of our power for the better functioning 
of this body and for the good of 
our country. 

I think the voters of this country 
were turned off by the constant bickering, 
the arguing back and forth that 
goes on in this Senate Chamber, the 
gridlock that ensued here, and the 
pointing of fingers of blame. 

Sometimes, in the fog of debate, like 
the fog of war, it is hard to determine 
who is responsible for slowing something 
down. It is like the shifting sand. 
People hide behind the filibuster. I 
think it is time to let the voters know 
that we heard their message in the last 
election. They did not send us here to 
bicker and to argue, to point fingers. 
They want us to get things done to address 
the concerns facing this country. 
They want us to reform this place. 
They want this place to operate a little 
better, a little more openly, and a little 
more decisively. 

Mr. President, I believe this Senate 
should embrace the vision of this body 
that our Founding Fathers had. There 
is a story—I am not certain whether it 
is true or not, but it is a nice story— 
that Thomas Jefferson returned from 
France, where he had learned that the 
Constitutional Convention had set up a 
separate body called the U.S. Senate, 
with its Members appointed by the legislatures 
and not subject to a popular 
vote. Jefferson was quite upset about 
this. He asked George Washington why 
this was done. Evidently, they were sitting 
at a breakfast table. Washington 
said to him, ‘‘Well, why did you pour 
your coffee in the saucer?’’ And Jefferson 
replied, ‘‘Why, to cool it, of 
course.’’ Washington replied, ‘‘Just so: 
We created the Senate to cool down the 
legislation that may come from the 
House.’’ 

I think General Washington was very 
wise. I think our Founding Fathers 
were very wise to create this body. 

They had seen what had happened in 
Europe—violent changes, rapid 
changes, mob rule—so they wanted the 
process to slow things down, to delib


erate a little more, and that is why the 
Senate was set up. 

But George Washington did not compare 
the Senate to throwing the coffee 
pot out the window. It is just to cool it 
down, and slow it down. 

I think that is what the Founding 
Fathers envisioned, and I think that is 
what the American people expect. That 
is what we ought to and should provide. 
The Senate should carefully consider 
legislation, whether it originates here, 
or whether it streams in like water 
from a fire hose from the House of Representatives, 
we must provide ample 
time for Members to speak on issues. 
We should not move to the limited debate 
that characterizes the House of 
Representatives. I am not suggesting 
that we do that. But in the end, the 
people of our country are entitled to 
know where we stand and how we vote 
on the merits of a bill or an amendment. 


Some argue that any supermajority 
requirement is unconstitutional, other 
than those specified in the Constitution 
itself. I find much in this theory 
to agree with—and I think we should 
treat all the rules that would limit the 
ability of a majority to rule with skepticism. 
I think that this theory is one 
that we ought to examine more fully, 
and that is the idea that the Constitution 
of the United States sets up certain 
specified instances in which a 
supermajority is needed to pass the 
bill, and in all other cases it is silent. 
In fact, the Constitution provides that 
the President of the Senate, the Vice 
President of the United States, can 
only vote to break a tie vote—by implication, 
meaning that the Senate should 
pass legislation by a majority vote, except 
in those instances in which the 
Constitution specifically says that we 
need a supermajority. 

The distinguished constitutional expert, 
Lloyd Cutler, a distinguished lawyer, 
has been a leading proponent of 
this view. I have not made up my mind 
on this theory, but I do believe it is 
something we ought to further examine. 
I find a lot that I agree with in 
that theory. 

But what we are getting at here is a 
different procedure and process, whereby 
we can have the Senate as the 
Founding Fathers envisioned—a place 
to cool down, slow down, deliberate and 
discuss, but not as a place where a 
handful—yes, maybe even one Senator—
can totally stop legislation or a 
nomination. 

Over the last couple of years, I have 
spent a great deal of time reading the 
history of this cloture process. Two 
years ago, about this time, I first proposed 
this to my fellow Democratic 
colleagues at a retreat we had in Williamsburg, 
VA. In May of that year, I 
proposed this to the Joint Committee 
on Congressional Reform. Some people 
said to me at that time: Senator HARKIN, 
of course you are proposing it, you 
are in the majority, you want to get 
rid of the filibuster. Well, now I am in 
the minority and I am still proposing it 


S 32 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

because I think it is the right thing to 
do. 

Let me take some time to discuss the 
history of cloture and the limitations 
on debate in the Senate. Prior to 1917 
there was no mechanism to shut off debate 
in the Senate. There was an early 
version in 1789 of what was called the 
‘‘previous question.’’ It was used more 
like a tabling motion than as a method 
to close debate. 

In the 19th century, Mr. President, 
elections were held in November and 
Congress met in December. This Congress 
was always a lame duck session, 
which ended in March of the next year. 
The newly elected members did not 
take office until the following December, 
almost 13 months later. During the 
entire 19th century, there were filibusters. 
But most of these were aimed at 
delaying congressional action at the 
end of the short session that ended 
March 4. A filibuster during the 19th 
century was used at the end of a session 
when the majority would try to 
ram something through at the end, 
over the objections of the minority. 
Extended debate was used to extend debate 
to March 4, when under the law at 
that time, it automatically died. 

If the majority tried to ram something 
through in the closing hours, the 
minority would discuss it and hold it 
up until March 4, and that was the end 
of it. That process was changed. Rather 
than going into an automatic lame-
duck session in December, we now convene 
a new Congress in January with 
the new Members. I think this is illustrative 
that the filibuster used in the 
19th century was entirely different in 
concept and in form than what we now 
experience here in the U.S. Senate. 

So those who argue that the filibuster 
in the U.S. Senate today is a 
time-honored tradition of the U.S. Senate 
going clear back to 1789 are mistaken, 
because the use of the filibuster 
in the 19th century was entirely different 
than what it is being used for 
today, and it was used in a different set 
of laws and circumstances under which 
Congress met. 

So that brings us up to the 20th century. 
In 1917, the first cloture rule was 
introduced in response to a filibuster, 
again, at the end of a session that triggered 
a special session. This cloture 
rule provided for two-thirds of Members 
present and voting to cut off debate. 
It was the first time since the 
first Congress met that the Senate 
adopted a cloture rule in 1917. However, 
this cloture rule was found to be ineffective 
and was rarely used. Why? Because 
rulings of the chair said that the 
cloture rule did not apply to procedural 
matters. So, if someone wanted to engage 
in a filibuster, they could simply 
bring up a procedural matter and filibuster 
that, and the two-thirds vote 
did not even apply to that. For a number 
of years, from 1917 until 1949, we 
had that situation. 

In 1949 an attempt was made to make 
the cloture motion more effective. The 
1949 rule applied the cloture rule to 

procedural matters. It closed that loophole 
but did not apply to rules changes. 
It also raised the needed vote from 
two-thirds present and voting to two-
thirds of the whole Senate, which at 
that time meant 64 votes. That rule existed 
for 10 years. 

In 1959, Lyndon Johnson pushed 
through a rules change to change the 
needed vote back to two-thirds of those 
present and voting, and which also applied 
cloture to rules changes. 

There were many attempts after that 
to change the filibuster. In 1975, after 
several years of debate here in the Senate, 
the current rule was adopted, as a 
compromise proposed by Senator BYRD 
of West Virginia. The present cloture 
rule allows cloture to be invoked by 
three-fifths of Senators chosen and 
sworn, or 60 votes, except in the case of 
rules changes, which still require two-
thirds of those present and voting. 

This change in the rule reducing the 
proportion of votes needed for cloture 
for the first time since 1917, and was 
the culmination of many years of efforts 
by reformers’ numerous proposals 
between 1959 and 1975. 

Two of the proposals that were made 
in those intervening years I found particularly 
interesting. One was by Senator 
Hubert Humphrey in 1963, which 
provided for majority cloture in two 
stages. The other proposal I found interesting 
was one by Senator DOLE in 
1971 that moved from the then current 
two-thirds present and voting down to 
three-fifths present and voting, reducing 
the number of votes by one with 
each successive cloture vote. 

We drew upon Senator DOLE’s proposal 
in developing our own proposal. 
Our proposal would reduce the number 
of votes needed to invoke cloture 
gradually, allowing time for debate, allowing 
us to slow things down, but ultimately 
allowing the Senate to get to 
the merits of a vote. 

Under our proposal, the amendment 
now before the Senate, Senators still 
have to get 16 signatures to offer a cloture 
motion. The motion would still 
have to lay over 2 days. The first vote 
to invoke cloture would require 60 
votes. If that vote did not succeed, 
they could file another cloture motion 
needing 16 signatures. They would have 
to wait at least 2 further days. On the 
next vote, they would need 57 votes to 
invoke cloture. If you did not get that, 
well, you would have to get 16 signatures, 
file another cloture motion, wait 
another couple days, and then you 
would have to have 54 votes. Finally, 
the same procedure could be repeated, 
and move to a cloture vote of 51. Finally, 
a simple majority vote could 
close debate, to get to the merits of the 
issue. 

By allowing this slow ratchet down, 
the minority would have the opportunity 
to debate, focus public attention 
on a bill, and communicate their case 
to the public. In the end, though, the 
majority could bring the measure to a 
final vote, as it generally should in a 
democracy. 

Mr. President, in the 19th century, as 
I mentioned before, filibusters were 
used to delay action on a measure until 
the automatic expiration of the session. 


Senators would then leave to go back 
to their States, or Congressmen back 
to their districts, and tell people about 
the legislation the majority was trying 
to ram through. They could get the 
public aroused about it, to put pressure 
on Senators not to support that measure 
or legislation. 

Keep in mind that in those days, 
there was no television, there was no 
radio, and scant few newspapers. Many 
people could not read or write and the 
best means of communication was 
when a Senator went out and spoke directly 
with his constituents. So it was 
necessary to have several months 
where a Senator could alert the public 
as to what the majority was trying to 
do, to protect the rights and interests 
of the minority. 

That is not the case today. Every 
word we say here is instantaneously 
beamed out on C–SPAN, watched all 
over the United States, and picked up 
on news broadcasts. We have the print 
media sitting up in the gallery. So the 
public is well aware and well informed 
of what is happening here in the Senate 
on a daily basis. We do have a need to 
slow the process down, but we do not 
need the several months that was needed 
in the 19th century. 

So as a Member of the new minority 
here in the Senate, I come to this issue 
as a clear matter of good public policy. 
I am pleased to say that it is a change 
that enjoys overwhelming support 
among the American people. 

A recent poll conducted by Action 
Not Gridlock—and I will have more to 
say about them in a second—found that 
80 percent of Independents, 84 percent 
of Democrats, and 79 percent of Republicans 
believe that once all Senators 
have been able to express their views, 
the Senate should be permitted to vote 
for or against a bill. 

As I mentioned, Mr. President, this 
poll was commissioned by a group 
called Action Not Gridlock, a broad 
array of distinguished Democratic and 
Republican leaders around the country 
formed to change the filibuster rule. 
These leaders include former Republican 
Senators Mac Mathias, Barry 
Goldwater, and Bob Stafford, as well as 
former Iowa Governor Bob Ray and 
former Secretary of HHS Arthur 
Flemming, all Republicans, as well as 
Democrats former Senator Bill Proxmire, 
former Senator Terry Sanford, 
and Ray Marshall. Action Not Gridlock 
has also formed a number of chapters 
around the country working to end the 
gridlock in Washington. 

In my own State of Iowa, there is a 
truly impressive bipartisan group 
working on this issue. It includes Michael 
Reagan, president of the Des 
Moines Chamber of Commerce; Republican 
majority leader of the Iowa 
House, Brent Siegrest; Abbi Swanson, 
president of the League of Women Vot



January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 33 

ers of Iowa; and former Democratic 
Congressman Berkeley Bedell. 

So, again, as you see, Mr. President, 
Action Not Gridlock has a broad array 
of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. 


Well, slaying the filibuster dinosaur—
and that is what I call it, a dinosaur, 
a relic of the ancient past—slaying 
the filibuster dinosaur has also 
been endorsed by papers around the 
country, including the New York 
Times, which just editorialized on this 
last Sunday; the USA Today; the Washington 
Post; the Fort Worth Star-Telegram; 
in my own State, the Des Moines 
Register, the Cedar Gazette, the Quad-
City Times, and the Council Bluffs 
Non-Pareil. 

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that those editorials that I just 
mentioned be printed at this point in 
the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 

DOWN WITH THE FILIBUSTER 
One of the mandates voters gave to Republicans 
on Nov. 8 was to reform the way Congress 
operates. There’s no better place to 
begin than with the Senate filibuster. 
The filibuster allows a minority to block 
passage of any bill unless a supermajority of 
60 votes in the 100-member Senate can be 
mustered to overcome it. Republicans used 
the filibuster liberally in the last few years 
to tie the majority Democrats in knots. 
Next year, with Republicans in the majority, 
Democrats will be in a position to return 
the favor. Nevertheless, Iowa Democratic 
Senator Tom Harkin is right in saying that 
the Democrats should resist the temptation 
to ‘‘do unto the Republicans what they did 
unto us.’’ 
Instead, Harkin is urging that the filibuster 
be tempered. Reform-minded members 
of both parties should join Harkin’s effort. 
There may have been some justification 
for the filibuster in its quaint original form, 
but the modern version of the filibuster has 
become nothing more than a cost-free device 
that lets a willful minority thwart the will 
of the majority, or hold legislation hostage 
to extort concessions. 
The filibuster evolved from the Senate’s 
tradition of unlimited debate. To carry out a 
filibuster, opponents of a bill had to try, literally, 
to talk it to death. Those engaged in 
a filibuster had to be prepared to keep talking 
around the clock. It required determination 
and stamina, and the filibustering senators 
risked arousing the public’s anger at 
their obstructionism. As a result, filibusters 
were rare. 
In recent years, the Senate adopted rules 
intended to curb filibusters. They ended up 
having precisely the opposite effect. Filibusters 
became an everyday tactic. By one 
count, there were twice as many filibusters 
in the last two years of Congress than during 
the entire 19th century. 
The new rules established a ‘‘two-track’’ 
procedure that allows the Senate to continue 
with other business while a filibuster is 
under way. All action does not grind to a 
halt, as it did previously. 
The two-track rule made filibusters much 
easier to use. Stamina is no longer required. 
Now, all the minority need do is declare its 
intention to filibuster, and the Senate 
switches to other businesses. In most cases, 
the mere threat of a filibuster does the trick. 
The bill is sidetracked until the majority 
finds 60 votes. 

The modern filibuster gives the minority 
an absolute veto. It is, quite simply, undemocratic. 


Defenders of the filibuster have argued 
that it is useful in preventing precipitous action. 
Harkin’s proposal addresses that argument 
by allowing filibusters to delay action, 
but not stop it completely. Under his plan, 
the number of votes required to end a filibuster 
would gradually decline over a period 
of weeks until, eventually, only 51 votes 
would be needed. 

A truer reform would be to abolish the undemocratic 
anachronism outright. Harkin’s 
proposal is quite modest. There should be no 
reasonable objection to it. 

[From the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, June 
30, 1994] 

If you started out to formulate the rules 
for a legislative body in a new democracy, 
the last example you would follow would be 
that of the U.S. Senate. 

Things have gotten so bad in the Senate 
that there is a growing movement to change 
the rules about unlimited debate—the filibusters 
that prevent action on legislation. 

If extended debate were really used to examine 
issues and change senators’ minds by 
force of powerful reason, there would be a 
case for keeping the present rules. But in 
truth, the Senate’s rules are being used to 
thwart the principle of majority rule and to 
further individual or partisan political interests 
to the detriment of the legislative process. 


To be sure, changing the cloture rule 
(which requires 60 votes to end debate and 
means that a 41-senator minority can effectively 
shut down the Senate) would not be a 
cure-all. Republicans this year have perfected 
the tactic of offering endless amendments 
to unrelated bills as a means of delaying 
legislative progress. But tempering the 
effect of the filibuster would help. 

The fate of the western grazing lands fee 
change was an example of the filibuster at 
work. In the Congress as a whole, 373 votes 
out of 535 (70 percent) were in favor, but the 
majority lost because 44 senators prevented 
cloture. 

This week, a 13-year effort to change product 
liability laws failed because of a filibuster, 
just as it had in 1986 and 1992. The 41 
senators voting against cloture included 
archconservatives (Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., 
Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and Strom Thurmond, 
R-S.C.) and archliberals (Paul 
Wellstone, D-Minn., Harris Wofford, D-Pa., 
and Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo.) and 
some in between (such as Bill Bradley, DN.
J., and John Breaux, D-La.). It was a good 
bill, one that would mean more jobs without 
sacrificing legitimate consumer interests. 
Much of the opposition came from trial lawyers. 
In the end, 57 senators voted for it. 
Forty-one opponents were enough to kill it. 
Is that democracy? 

The Senate has reached the point where 
the mere threat of a filibuster can bring the 
body’s work to a screeching halt. 

Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, has suggested a 
four-vote process that would break this impasses. 
On the first cloture vote, 60 votes 
would be needed to end debate, as now. On 
the next vote, 57 would be required; on the 
third, 54, and on the fourth, only a 51-vote 
majority. This would preserve Senate tradition 
and give the minority plenty of time to 
plead its case, without allowing a majority 
to be forever thwarted. Sounds good to us. 

Now into the fray comes Action, Not 
Gridlock!, an anti-filibuster group dedicated 
to changing the Senate rules. It is led by a 
bipartisan group of former senators, representatives 
and other government officials. 
What they share is believe in majority rule. 
We wish them godspeed. 

[From USA Today, Nov. 25, 1994] 

REIN IN THE POWER TO SHUT DOWN THE 
SENATE 

In 1908, Sen. Robert M. La Follette Sr. of 
Wisconsin was in the middle of a filibuster 
when he discovered the eggnog he was drinking 
for energy had been poisoned. La Follette 
survived. So did the filibuster. 

Indeed, the filibuster today is more poisonous 
than La Follette ever could have imagined. 
Instead of providing a dramatic final 
forum for individuals against a stampeding 
majority, it has become a pedestrian tool of 
partisans and gridlock-meisters. 

Since 1990, the Senate has averaged at 
least 15 filibusters a year, more than in all 
the 140 years before. In 1994 alone, filibusters 
were used to weaken or kill legislation ranging 
from lobbying and campaign finance reform 
to clean water. 

You need not be a bow-tied parliamentarian 
to see the problem. The filibuster allows 
single lawmakers to derail the Senate’s ma-
jority—easily, arbitrarily. If the Senate is to 
honor its deliberative tradition, it must restrain 
the filibuster. 

The modern filibuster vexes Congress two 
ways. First, opponents must find 60 votes to 
break it. That’s called cloture, and it’s almost 
impossible to achieve. In 1987, only one 
of 15 votes succeeded—on a proposal for a 
$12,000 congressional pay raise. 

Second, the mere threat of a filibuster is 
enough to sidetrack a bill. Instead of requiring 
filibusters to take the floor, Senate leaders 
just move on to the next issue. 

The 60-vote requirement means, in effect, 
that all legislation must have a 
supermajority to pass. Yet the Constitution 
requires supermajorities in only five areas: 
treaty ratification, presidential veto overrides, 
impeachment votes, constitutional 
amendments, and to expel a member of Congress. 
The framers, who never foresaw the 
filibuster’s abuse, considered supermajorities 
for other matters and rejected them. 

They protected against tyrannical majorities 
in other ways: by dividing government 
power among three branches, by splitting 
Congress into two parts, by guaranteeing 
basic rights in the Constitution. 

Those are ample safeguards. The filibuster, 
on the other hand, lets a lone lawmaker impose 
his will, not just amplify his voice. 

Solutions? Several. 

First, make a filibusterer put his body 
where his mouth is. Sen. Strom Thurmond 
prepared for his record-setting 24-hour, 18minute 
speech against the 1957 Civil Rights 
Act by visiting a steam room, hoping to diminish 
the call of nature once on the floor. 
Sen. Estes Kefauver strapped on a motorman’s 
friend for his 1950 filibuster. The device 
was misaligned, though, and only a 
timely quorum call prevented him from 
making the wrong kind of splash. 

The point is that old-time filibusterers had 
to have the courage of their convictions. The 
rigors of floor debate were not undertaken 
lightly. 

Such was the case even when filibusterers 
formed talking tag teams. In 1960, 18 Southern 
lawmakers formed two-man partnerships 
to hold the floor against civil rights legislation. 
After 157 hours—the Senate’s longest 
continuous session—they prevailed. That 
was not a proud moment in national lawmaking, 
but at least the racists were accountable, 
something today’s fiddle-footed 
rules make unnecessary. 

More recently, the government this year 
had to sell billions of dollars’ worth of American 
gold to a Canadian firm for just $10,000 
because filibusterers prevented reform of an 
1872 mining law. 

Sen. Tom Harkin this week has revived another 
idea: Gradually lower the number of 


S 34 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

votes needed for cloture. The first vote 
would still require 60 ‘‘ayes.’’ But subsequent 
votes would require 57, then 54, then 51. This 
could preserve both the dramatic effect of a 
filibuster and majority rule. 

The filibuster is a supervirus in the Senate. 
It causes massive hemorrhaging of majority 
rule and the orderly process of legislating. 
If Senate leaders don’t cure themselves 
soon, they might as well ask La 
Follett’s ghost to, please, pass the eggnog. 

[From the New York Times, Jan. 1, 1995] 
TIME TO RETIRE THE FILIBUSTER 
The U.S. Senate likes to call itself the 
world’s greatest deliberative body. The 
greatest obstructive body is more like it. In 
the last season of Congress, the Republican 
minority invoked an endless string of filibusters 
to frustrate the will of the majority. 
This relentless abuse of a time-honored Senate 
tradition so disgusted Senator Tom Harkin, 
a Democrat from Iowa, that he is now 
willing to forgo easy retribution and drastically 
limit the filibuster. Hooray for him. 
For years Senate filibusters—when they 
weren’t conjuring up romantic images of 
Jimmy Stewart as Mr. Smith, passing out 
from exhaustion on the Senate floor—consisted 
mainly of negative feats of endurance. 
Senator Sam Ervin once spoke for 22 hours 
straight. Outrage over these tactics and 
their ability to bring Senate business to a 
halt led to the current so-called two-track 
system, whereby a senator can hold up one 
piece of legislation while other business goes 
on as usual. 
The two-track system has been nearly as 
obstructive as the old rules. Under those 
rules, if the Senate could not muster the 60 
votes necessary to end debate and bring a 
bill to a vote, someone had to be willing to 
continue the debate, in person, on the floor. 
That is no longer required. Even if the 60 
votes are not achieved, debate stops and the 
Senate proceeds with other business. The 
measure is simply put on hold until the next 
cloture vote. In this way a bill can be stymied 
at any number of points along its legislative 
journey. 
One unpleasant and unforeseen consequence 
has been to make the filibuster 
easy to invoke and painless to pursue. Once 
a rarely used tactic reserved for issues on 
which senators held passionate convictions, 
the filibuster has become the tool of the sore 
loser, dooming any measure that cannot 
command the 60 required votes. 
Mr. Harkin, along with Senator Joseph 
Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, now 
proposes to make such obstruction harder. 
Mr. Harkin says reasonably that there must 
come a point in the process where the majority 
rules. This may not sit well with some of 
his Democratic colleagues. They are now 
perfectly positioned to exact revenge by 
frustrating the Republican agenda as efficiently 
as Republicans frustrated Democrats 
in 1994. 
Admirably, Mr. Harkin says he does not 
want to do that. He proposes to change the 
rules so that if a vote for cloture fails to attract 
the necessary 60 votes, the number of 
votes needed to close off debate would be reduced 
by three in each subsequent vote. By 
the time the measure came to a fourth 
vote—with votes occurring no more frequently 
than every second day—cloture 
could be invoked with only a simple majority. 
Under the Harkin plan, minority members 
who feel passionately about a given 
measure could still hold it up, but not indefinitely. 
Another set of reforms, more incremental 
but also useful, is proposed by George Mitchell, 
who is retiring as the Democratic majority 
leader. He wants to eat away at some of 
the more annoying kinds of brakes that can 

be applied to a measure along its legislative 
journey. 

One example is the procedure for sending a 
measure to a conference committee with the 
House. Under current rules, unless the Senate 
consents unanimously to send a measure 
to conference, three separate motions can be 
required to move it along. This gives one 
senator the power to hold up a measure almost 
indefinitely. Mr. Mitchell would like to 
reduce the number of motions to one. 

He would also like to limit the debate on a 
motion to two hours and count the time 
consumed by quorum calls against the debate 
time of a senator, thus encouraging senators 
to save their time for debating the substance 
of a measure rather than in obstruction. 
All of his suggestions seem reasonable, 
but his reforms would leave the filibuster essentially 
intact. 

The Harkin plan, along with some of Mr. 
Mitchell’s proposals, would go a long way toward 
making the Senate a more productive 
place to conduct the nation’s business. Republicans 
surely dread the kind of obstructionism 
they themselves practiced during 
the last Congress. Now is the perfect moment 
for them to unite with like-minded 
Democrats to get rid of an archaic rule that 
frustrates democracy and serves no useful 
purpose. 

[From the Washington Post, Nov. 23, 1994] 
THE GORED OXEN 
One of the most comical aspects of politics 
concerns how high principles about procedural 
fairness can evaporate when circumstances 
change. There could be much 
such comedy in the new Congress as Democrats 
and Republicans change roles. 
In the House, Newt Gingrich’s Republicans 
have assembled a series of reform measures 
that grew from their experience as frustrated 
members of what seemed a permanent opposition. 
They rightly criticized Democratic 
House leaders for closing off Republican 
amendments to important bills. Now Mr. 
Gingrich pledges to change that, even 
though doing so would let the now-minority 
Democrats challenge the most unpopular of 
the Republican majority’s proposals. Republicans 
have also long been in favor of the 
line-item veto, which would let the president 
excise particular parts of spending bills he 
found offensive. Republicans liked this when 
the Democrats in Congress were responsible 
for writing the spending bills, since they presumed 
that Republican presidents would cut 
out what Republicans saw as ‘‘pork.’’ Now 
the line-item veto would empower a Democratic 
president facing a Republican Congress. 
In the Senate, the problem is different. 
Senate rules permit essentially unlimited 
debate. It takes 60 votes to shut the talking 
down. That means 41 senators can block a 
bill and frustrate the will of even an overwhelming 
majority. In the last Congress, the 
Democrats were critical of Republican abuse 
of the filibuster. But now the procedural 
shoe is on the other foot. It’s the Democratic 
minority that is likely to want to block 
many Republican measures. Will Democrats 
keep saying the filibuster is a bad thing? To 
his credit, one Democrat, Sen. Tom Harkin 
of Iowa, has done so. He proposes that the 
two parties agree to new rules. Mr. Harkin 
would still let the minority slow down consideration 
of controversial measures, but he 
doesn’t think the minority should ultimately 
frustrate the majority’s will. 
It is not even necessary to get to the question 
of whether the filibuster rule itself 
should be eliminated to believe that there 
has been too much abuse of the filibuster in 
the Senate. The same can be said of the 
closed rule in the House. We hope Mr. Gingrich 
sticks to his promise of opening up the 

House, even if that might sometimes inconvenience 
his party. Similarly in the Senate, 
we hope both parties can find a more reasonable 
accommodation between minority 
rights and majority rule. Going to the brink 
every time, on every issue, is not the way a 
democracy is supposed to work. 

HARKIN EARNS BOUQUET, BRICKBAT 
We have a bouquet and a brickbat for 
Iowa’s Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. 
The bouquet is for advocating limits on the 
filibuster, a technique used by the minority 
party in the U.S. Senate to thwart the will of 
the majority. 
The brickbat is for his lukewarm support 
for the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade. 
Harkin is calling for revision of the filibuster 
rules that would provide a means for 
the minority to slow down legislation and 
allow fuller debate, but at the same time it 
places limits on the delaying tactic. 
Under Harkin’s plan, 60 votes would be necessary 
in the first attempt to halt a filibuster 
debate. 
The second attempt would require only 57 
votes. The number would continue to drop on 
each successive vote until only a simple majority 
was needed. 
Currently, a single senator can tie up legislation 
endlessly, which Harkin says adds to 
the deadlock. 
Harkin’s plan would limit the delay to a 
maximum of about three weeks. 
As American politics becomes more contentious, 
the filibuster is being used increasingly. 
But Harkin says there is less need for 
it. 
In the last century when communication 
was slower, senators felt the need to stall for 
long periods to allow their objections to 
reach constituents. 
In these days of almost instant communication, 
voters and others can be alerted to 
problems in a matter of hours. 
We believe the senator is on track and 
should pursue his efforts. Continuing the 
current processes is simply obstructionism, 
whether by Republicans or Democrats. 
We are less enthusiastic about the senator’s 
doubts concerning GATT. 
Unfortunately, these seem to be based on 
some vague concerns about ill-defined political 
horse trading that may be under way by 
supporters to ensure passage of the measure 
through the Senate. 
Passage in the House seems a surer bet 
with the strong support voiced by Speaker-
designate Newt Gingrich. Gingrich seems to 
understand the obvious advantages for the 

U.S. economy and the need for a workable 
free trade mechanism. 
We get the feeling that Harkin may not be 
sure which direction the political winds are 
blowing in Iowa, and wants more time to determine 
the level of support for GATT. 

He admits that he will likely face stiff 
competition for his Senate seat in two years. 
Given the Republican landslide in Iowa, political 
caution may become increasingly important 
for Harkin. 

However, we do not believe this is a Republican 
vs. Democrat issue. Passage of GATT is 
needed to make sure the United States is a 
major player in the world. 

The death of GATT, which a delay very seriously 
threatens, could throw orderly world 
trade into chaos and possibly lead to the 
emergence of regional trading blocks with 
barriers against U.S. products. 

The impact on the future of the U.S. economy 
could be disastrous and possibly irreversible. 


The argument that senators have not had 
time to study the GATT document is not 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 35 

compelling. The agreement has been hammered 
out by representatives of 123 nations 
over the past eight years. 

For a document of such magnitude and importance 
for open world trade, we wonder 
why more attention has not been paid by 
Harkin and others until the last weeks before 
the vote. 

There may be flaws. No document requiring 
the assent of 123 countries can be perfect. 
Every nation had to give up some special interest. 


But those flaws do not appear sufficient to 
warrant opposition to congressional passage. 

[From Quad-City Times, Nov. 22, 1994] 
HARKIN KEEPS HIS PROMISE 
Two months ago, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa 
expressed dismay at the way Republicans 
had repeatedly blocked legislation that was 
supported by a majority of the Senate. 
‘‘I’ve been in Congress 20 years,’’ he said, 
‘‘and this has been the worst year I’ve seen. 
The constant use of the filibuster, the 
gridlock . . . And there’s a meanness, a mean 
spiritedness, I have never seen before.’’ Harkin 
said he intended to introduce a bill next 
year that would greatly curtail the filibustering 
powers of the minority party. 
But in the two months since making those 
comments, Harkin and other Democrats 
have become the minority party. With the 
Republicans now in control of the Senate, 
Democrats will need every weapon in the arsenal 
to fight the GOP agenda. So does he 
still see a need to revise the filibuster rule? 
Yes—and his position now carries more 
weight because of his new status as a member 
of the Senate’s minority party. 
Today, Harkin is expected to formally announce 
his plans to introduce a bill that 
would allow the filibuster to slow, but not 
kill, legislation. The bill mirrors legislation 
once proposed by Bob Dole, and it deserves 
passage. 
And Tom Harkin deserves credit for continuing 
to advocate this long-overdue 
change. 

HARKIN’S GOOD IDEA: DEFLATING FILIBUSTER 
Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin is putting his 
money where his mouth is. 
He is no fan of the filibuster, a device used 
almost exclusively by minority senators to 
impede distasteful legislation. So he has offered 
legislation to create an alternative 
parliamentary tool. 
As it stands, if 41 senators (out of the 100member 
chamber) are able to stand firm, 
they can prevent action on an issue by applying 
Senate rules allowing them to filibuster. 
Halting the filibuster requires 60 
votes. Tough to get. 
Harkin and Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut 
Democrat, have co-sponsored a 
measure that still enables a minority to 
have its voice, but not in perpetuity. 
It is a noteworthy position for minority 
lawmakers who potentially could lose their 
only real tool against a dominating majority. 
(It wouldn’t be surprising if both are 
confident that their upcoming minorityhood 
is merely an aberration that voters will correct 
in 1996.) Their plan would give the minority 
the 60-vote cushion on the first call 
for cloture, dropping to 57 votes on a second 
call, 54 on a third and, finally, to a simple 
majority of 51 on a fourth cloture vote. 
Our sense of the filibuster has been that it 
can be the only way a congressional minority 
might have a voice in formation of public 
policy. Majority parties don’t have a patent 
on perfection, but frequently choose to ignore 
even reasonable suggestions from minority 
lawmakers. There’s often not even a 
hint of the compromise we should expect in 
government. 

Conceding that the process can be abused, 
however, perhaps the Harkin-Lieberman approach 
deserves a thorough hearing. Filibustering 
is not a constitutional right. It exists 
only at the pleasure of Congress. Any substitute 
would have a similarly tenuous existence. 


Gridlock has become a buzzword characterizing 
Congress. Any mechanism to prevent 
that condition and restore the job description 
originally given members of Congress 
would be most welcome. 

The anti-gridlock, anti-filibuster concept 
shouldn’t be scrapped without closer scrutiny. 


(Mr. FRIST assumed the chair.) 

Mr. HARKIN. Let me just quote from 
a couple of these editorials, because I 
think it really puts things in the proper 
perspective. 

First, let me quote from the Des 
Moines Register’s sterling editorial of 
the 23d of November. 

The modern filibuster gives the minority 
an absolute veto. It is, quite simply, undemocratic. 


Defenders of the filibuster have argued 
that it is useful in preventing precipitous action. 
Harkin’s proposal addresses that argument 
by allowing filibusters to delay action, 
but not stop it completely. Under his plan, 
the number of votes required to end a filibuster 
would gradually decline over a period 
of weeks until, eventually, only 51 votes 
would be needed. 

A truer reform would be to abolish the undemocratic 
anachronism outright. Harkin’s 
proposal is quite modest. There should be no 
reasonable objection to it. 

And this from the Fort Worth Star 
Telegram, Fort Worth, TX. 

If you started out to formulate the rules 
for a legislative body in a new democracy, 
the last example you would follow would be 
that of the U.S. Senate. 

Things have gotten so bad in the Senate 
that there is a growing movement to change 
the rules about unlimited debate—the filibusters 
that prevent action on legislation. 

If extended debate were really used to examine 
issues and change senators’ minds by 
force of powerful reason, there would be a 
case for keeping the present rules. But in 
truth, the Senate’s rules are being used to 
thwart the principle of majority rule and to 
further individual or partisan political interests 
to the detriment of the legislative process. 


In truth, the Senate rules are being 
used to thwart the principles of majority 
rule and to further individual or 
partisan political interests to the detriment 
of the legislative process. And 
this from the USA Today. The 60-vote 
requirement means, in effect, all legislation 
must have a supermajority to 
pass. Yet, the Constitution requires 
supermajorities in only five areas: 
treaty ratification, Presidential veto 
overrides, impeachment votes, constitutional 
amendments, and expelling 
a Member of Congress. 

The Framers, who never foresaw the 
filibuster’s abuse, considered the 
supermajority for other matters and 
rejected it. They protected against tyrannical 
majorities in other ways by 
dividing Government power among 
three branches, by splitting Congress 
into two parts, and by guaranteeing 
basic rights in the Constitution. 

The USA Today editorial ends by 
saying, ‘‘The filibuster is a super virus 

in the Senate. It causes massive hemorrhaging 
of majority rule and the orderly 
process of legislation. If Senate 
leaders do not curb themselves soon, 
they might as well ask LaFollette’s 
ghost to, please, pass the eggnog.’’ I did 
not read the first part of this editorial 
which says that ‘‘In 1908, Senator Robert 
M. LaFollette, Sr., of Wisconsin, 
was in the middle of a filibuster, when 
he discovered the eggnog he was drinking 
for energy had been poisoned. La 
Follette survived, and so did the filibuster.’’ 


From the New York Times: ‘‘The 
United States Senate likes to call itself 
the world’s greatest deliberative 
body. Greatest obstructive body is 
more like it.’’ 

Later they write: ‘‘The Harkin plan, 
along with some of Mr. Mitchell’s proposals, 
would go a long way toward 
making the Senate a more productive 
place to conduct the Nation’s business. 
Republicans surely dread the kind of 
obstructionism they themselves practiced 
during the last Congress. Now is 
the perfect moment for them to unite 
with like-minded Democrats to get rid 
of an archaic rule that frustrates democracy 
and serves no useful purpose.’’ 

Those are just some of the quotes 
from some of the editorials that I had 
asked be inserted in the RECORD. Mr. 
President, I think you get the idea that 
changing this filibuster rule has great 
support around the country, both from 
what one might call liberal newspapers 
to those of a more conservative bent. 

Mr. President, the Members of the 
Senate that were sworn in today are 
sending us a message that we need to 
change. The present occupant of the 
chair was one of those just sworn in 
today. The filibuster rule is one area 
where change is most desperately needed, 
a dinosaur that has somehow survived 
from a previous age. 

I would like to read a couple of other 
quotes. In 1893, then Senator Henry 
Cabot Lodge, Sr., from Massachusetts, 
was opposing a filibuster. He made this 
quote: 

To vote without debate is perilous, but to 
debate and never vote is imbecile. 

Here is another quote that I found in 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of February 
10, 1971: 

It is one thing to provide protection 
against majoritarian absolutism; it is another 
thing again to enable a vexatious or 
unreasoning minority to paralyze the Senate, 
and America’s legislative process along 
with it. 

Senator BOB DOLE, February 10, 1971. 

So I consider myself to be in reasonably 
good company when I say that it 
is time to change the filibuster rule so 
that we can get on with the Nation’s 
business. I know there are those who 
believe very strongly we must maintain 
it, but as I said earlier, Mr. President, 
I think it is time for each of us to 
give up a little bit of our pride, a little 
bit of our privilege, a little bit of our 
prerogative, and a little bit of our 


S 36 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

power for the smoother functioning of 
the U.S. Senate and for the good of this 
country. 

By passing this amendment, we can 
take a giant step forward toward restoring 
the faith of the American people 
in their Government. We can tell 
the American people that we got their 
message that they want action and not 
gridlock. We can say that the time for 
change is now. And we can greatly improve 
the workings and productivity of 
the Senate. 

There will be many packages introduced 
to reform Congress. I think the 
House is even now debating reforms in 
their body. There will be reforms suggested 
here—gift-ban laws, lobbying 
disclosure laws—making Congress live 
by the same laws and regulations by 
which businesses live. These are good 
laws and good reforms. 

But Mr. President, there is no reform 
more important to this country and to 
this body than slaying the dinosaur 
called the filibuster. We need to change 
it so that we can really get back to 
what our Founding Fathers envisioned—
a process whereby the minority 
can slow things down, debate them, 
but not kill things outright. Give the 
minority that protection. 

As the USA Today editorial pointed 
out, there are other ways the Framers 
protected against majoritarian absolutism—
separate branches and powers, 
and the basic rights guaranteed by the 
Constitution. 

So, Mr. President, I submit that 
many of the reforms that will be offered 
here in the Senate in these opening 
days are very good. I intend to support 
many if not all of them. But if we 
do not change the way the filibuster 
operates here in the Senate, then I do 
not think that we heard the message 
that the American people sent to us. 

With that, I see my colleague, Senator 
LIEBERMAN, a cosponsor of the 
amendment, on the floor. Mr. President, 
I yield the floor at this time. 

Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the 
Chair. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Connecticut. 

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, 
thank you. 

I am very proud to join with my colleague 
from Iowa in cosponsoring and 
supporting this amendment. A new day 
has dawned here on Capitol Hill today. 
A new majority has come to power; 
but, hopefully, more than a new majority—
a new sense of responsiveness to 
the public, a new understanding of 
what it means to do the public’s business 
here in Congress, and a new openness 
to looking at some parts of the operation 
in Congress which we have previously 
either not questioned or felt it 
was inappropriate to question. 

I must say that over the last couple 
of years, as I watched the filibuster 
being used and, I think, in my respectful 
opinion, ultimately misused and 
overused, it seems to me that what had 
originally appeared to be a reasonable 

idea was being put to very unreasonable 
use. 

Therefore, I promised myself that if I 
was fortunate enough to be reelected 
by the people of Connecticut to return 
for the 104th Congress, I would do what 
I could to try to change this filibuster 
rule, which I am afraid has come to be 
a means of frustrating the will of a majority 
to do the public’s business and 
respond to the public’s needs. And so 
when I heard that Senator HARKIN had 
put this program and plan together, I 
called him and I said, ‘‘My distinguished 
colleague and friend, I admire 
you for what you are doing.’’ There are 
those who undoubtedly will think this 
is a quixotic effort, that it is a kind of 
romantic but unfeasible effort. 

It is important now to make this effort 
to show that we have heard the 
message and that we are prepared to 
not only shake up the Federal Government 
but shake up the Congress. And 
not just for the sake of shaking it up, 
but because of a fundamental principle 
that is basic to our democracy, that is 
deep into the deliberations of the 
Framers of our Constitution and appears 
throughout the Federalist Papers, 
which is rule of the majority in 
the legislative body. It is this majority 
rule has been frustrated by the existing 
filibuster rule. So I am privileged to 
join as a cosponsor with my colleague 
from Iowa in this effort. 

Mr. President, whenever I explain to 
my constituents at home in Connecticut 
that a minority of Senators can by 
a mere threat of a filibuster—not even 
by the continuous debate, but by a 
mere threat of a filibuster—kill a bill 
on the Senate floor, they are incredulous. 
When I tell them that now as a 
matter of course a Senator needs to obtain 
60 votes in order to pass a bill to 
which there is opposition, frankly, the 
folks back home are suspicious. 

When I explain how often the threat 
of a filibuster has been used to tie the 
Senate in knots and kill legislation 
that is actually favored by a majority 
of Senators—and the filibuster was 
used more times last year than in the 
first 108 years of the Senate combined—
well, the folks back home honestly 
think I am exaggerating. Unfortunately, 
I am not. Those are the facts. 

Mr. President, when I entered the 
Senate 6 years ago, I asked to be 
briefed by a staff person at the Congressional 
Research Service on the 
Senate rules. I wanted to figure out 
how the place worked. 

I must say, after that briefing, I, like 
my constituents, was incredulous. I 
had been the majority leader of the 
Connecticut State Senate, so I had 
some familiarity with parliamentary 
procedures, but I must say I did not understand 
how the Senate’s debate and 
amendment rules were being used to 
keep the Senate, presumably the greatest 
deliberative body in the world, from 
getting things done. 

Like many Americans of my generation, 
I remembered the dramatic filibuster 
battles of the 1950’s and 1960’s 

and assumed that filibusters were relatively 
uncommon and were employed 
only in the great issues of the time 
which divided a country. I assumed— 
like most Americans, I would guess, 
drawing from probably the broadest experience 
America has had with filibusters, 
which is mainly ‘‘Mr. Smith Goes 
to Washington,’’ when James Stewart 
stood in that magnificent portrayal 
and carried out a principled filibuster 
—that filibusters were to be reserved 
for only the most significant of legislative 
battles. 

While I quickly learned that while 
real filibusters are uncommon, current 
Senate rules allow the mere threat of a 
filibuster to rule the way we do or do 
not do business. 

The gentleman from the Congressional 
Research Service used a powerful 
analogy here. He said to me, ‘‘Senator, 
you have to think of the Senate 
as if it were composed of 100 nations, 
each Senator representing a nation, 
and each nation has an atomic bomb 
and can blow up the place any time it 
wants. And that bomb is a filibuster.’’ 

That may make us feel good about 
our power and our authority, but it is 
not the way to run the greatest deliberative 
body in the world. In fact, I 
state this with some humility because 
I do not remember the exact quote, I 
asked the gentleman from the Congressional 
Research Service, ‘‘Is there any 
precedent for this kind of procedure in 
the history of legislative bodies?’’ 

He said he thought the closest modern 
precedent was a Senate that sat in 
Poland in the 18th century which, because 
of unique historical circumstances 
that are not to the point, 
with approximately 700 members, the 
rule was that nothing could be done 
without unanimous consent. That, I 
hope, is not the model that we aspire 
to copy here. 

What was once an extraordinary remedy, 
used only in the rarest of instances, 
has unfortunately become a 
commonplace tactic to thwart the will 
of the majority. Just as insidiously, allowing 
legislation to be killed on procedural 
votes, as we so often have here 
in the Senate, protects us from having 
to confront the hard choices that we 
were sent here to make and, in that 
sense, makes us a less accountable 
body. 

Mr. President, this has to end and it 
will not end unless an effort begins to 
end it as we are attempting to do here 
today. As I believe Senator HARKIN has 
indicated, the Senate filibuster rule 
has actually been changed five times in 
this century. In most cases, particularly 
when the changes were substantial, 
they did not occur the first time 
the proponents charged the fortress. 
Perhaps they will not occur on this occasion. 
But I know Senator HARKIN and 
I are prepared to keep fighting until 
this change occurs because of what is 
on the line, which is the credibility and 
the productivity of the U.S. Senate. 

The change that we are proposing, as 
Senator HARKIN has indicated, will 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 37 

make it more difficult for a minority 
of Senators to absolutely stop, to 
block, to kill Senate action on legislation 
favored by a majority of the Senate, 
but it will still protect the ability 
of that minority to be heard before up 
or down majority votes on legislation 
are taken. It will give the minority opposed 
to what the majority wants to do 
the opportunity to educate and arouse 
the public as to what may be happening 
here to give the public the opportunity 
perhaps to change the inclination 
of the majority. 

The procedure of succeeding votes 
with 2-day intervals, 60 being required, 
first 57, 54 and finally a simple majority 
of Senators being able to work its 
will—our intent here is to give the minority 
a chance to make their case and 
to persuade others but not to continue 
to grant them an effective veto power 
which they now enjoy. 

We recognize that the opposition to 
this proposal is bipartisan, just as the 
use of the filibuster rule has been bipartisan. 
We also understand that as 
Members of the new minority, Senator 
HARKIN and I perhaps are not the 
likeliest people to be proposing to 
limit the powers of the new Democratic 
minority, but we both firmly believe 
that regardless of how our resolution 
may limit our personal options as 
Members of the minority party in the 
Senate in the short-term, it is essential 
that this reform be undertaken now 
when the problem of filibuster-created 
gridlock is so fresh in all of our minds. 

For too long, we have accepted the 
premise that the filibuster rule is immune. 
Yet, Mr. President, there is no 
constitutional basis for it. We impose 
it on ourselves. And if I may say so respectfully, 
it is, in its way, inconsistent 
with the Constitution, one might 
almost say an amendment of the Constitution 
by rule of the U.S. Senate. 

The Framers of the Constitution, 
this great fundamental, organic American 
document considered on which 
kinds of votes, on which issues the will 
of the majority would not be enough, 
that a vote of more than a majority 
would be required, and the Constitution 
has spelled those instances out 
quite clearly. Only five areas: Ratification 
of a treaty requires more than a 
majority of the Senate; override by the 
Senate of a Presidential veto requires 
more than a majority; a vote of impeachment 
requires more than a majority; 
passage of a constitutional amendment 
requires more than a majority; 
and the expulsion of a Member of Congress 
requires more than a majority. 

The Framers actually considered the 
wisdom of requiring supermajorities 
for other matters and rejected them. 

So it seems to me to be inconsistent 
with the Constitution that this body, 
by its rules, has essentially amended 
the Constitution to require 60 votes to 
pass any issue on which Members 
choose to filibuster or threaten to filibuster. 


The Framers, I think, understood— 
more than understood—expressed 

through the Constitution and their deliberations 
and their writings, that the 
Congress was to be a body in which the 
majority would rule. 

I know that some of our colleagues 
will oppose the alteration, the amendment, 
that Senator HARKIN and I are 
proposing on the grounds the filibuster 
is a very special prerogative that is 
necessary to protect the rights of a minority. 
But in doing so, and I say this 
respectfully, I believe they are not 
being true to the intention of the 
Framers of the Constitution, which is 
that the Congress was the institution 
in which the majority was to rule, not 
to be effectively tyrannized by a minority. 
And the Framers, Madison and 
the others, who thought so deeply and 
created this extraordinary instrument 
that has guided our country for more 
than 200 years now, developed the system 
in which the rights of the minority 
were to be protected by the republican 
form of government, by the checks and 
balances inherent in our Government 
and ultimately by the courts applying 
the great principles of the Constitution, 
particularly the Bill of Rights, to 
protect the rights of a minority that 
might be infringed by a wayward majority. 


So this procedure that has grown up 
over the years has turned the intention 
of the Framers, in my opinion, on its 
head, and in doing so has not only created 
gridlock but has given power to a 
minority as against the will of the majority. 
The majority in the Senate, as 
reflecting the majority of the people of 
the United States, has allowed that minority 
to frustrate the will of the majority 
improperly. 

So I think this is at the heart of the 
change for which the people have cried 
out. It is right, and it is fair. It is our 
belief in that most fundamental of 
democratic principles, majority rule, 
that motivates our introduction of this 
amendment. I am confident that if we 
ever put this issue, or could put this 
issue, before the American people for a 
vote, they would direct us to end the 
current filibuster practice. Majority 
rule is not and should not be a controversial 
proposition. Minority rights 
are protected by the checks and balances 
in our system. 

Mr. President, it is my pleasure as a 
Senator from Connecticut to welcome 
the occupant of the chair as a new 
Member of the Senate. Perhaps you 
have observed from your viewing of the 
Senate before you arrived here that our 
problem seems not to have been that 
things move through this institution 
too quickly, that we hastily trample 
upon the rights of the minority. The 
problem, if anything—and it is not a 
bad problem and it does carry out the 
intention and will of the Framers—is 
that there are a lot of checks and balances 
here, and it is often hard to do 
the people’s business and respond to 
the people’s needs, and the filibuster 
has made it even harder to do so. 

So I thank the Chair and the Senate 
for their indulgence. I congratulate 

again my colleague from Iowa for initiating 
this forthright and, in its way, 
courageous attempt to change the status 
quo, and I urge my colleagues to 
support the amendment. 

Mr. HARKIN. Before the Senator 
yields the floor, will the Senator yield? 

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would certainly 
yield the floor to my friend from Iowa. 

Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague 
and good friend from Connecticut for 
his support, his involvement, and his 
help in the drafting of this amendment 
and putting it together. The Senator 
from Connecticut is one of those who 
stood in the well today and took his 
oath of office for the second time. The 
Senator from Connecticut, I think I 
can say without any fear of being in 
error, in his entire first term in the 
Senate was recognized for his constant 
effort to provide for reform, for change 
in the way this place operates to make 
it more open, to make us more accountable, 
and to ensure that the people 
of Connecticut, indeed the people of 
the United States, have the right to insist 
that Senators vote on the merits of 
legislation. So the Senator is not a 
newcomer to congressional reform and 
to making this body operate more effectively 
and efficiently. I congratulate 
the people of Connecticut for their wisdom 
in returning him to this body. 

I thank the Senator very much for 
his support of this measure. As the 
Senator so wisely said, any time that 
the rules have been changed on the filibuster 
in the past, it has sometimes 
taken a great deal of time and effort. 
We will persevere in this effort because 
we believe it is the right course for the 
American people. But I believe by the 
changes that were made in November, 
the big changes that were made, the 
American people were sending us a 
very powerful message, and I believe, if 
we do not do something about this dinosaur, 
we are going to be involved in 
another couple of years of frustration. 

So I just wanted to thank the Senator 
for his support, for his involvement, 
for his help in the drafting of 
this amendment, and I thank him for 
his 6 years of efforts to make the Senate 
a more responsive and responsible 
body. 

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
Iowa for his kind words. I would just 
say to him that it is really an honor to 
begin this session by being his partner 
in this effort that I think is really at 
the heart of making the Senate a more 
responsive body. 

I thank the Chair, and I yield the 
floor. 

Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from West Virginia is recognized. 

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before the 
distinguished Senator from Connecticut 
leaves the floor—and I know he 
must depart soon; he has someone 
waiting on him—my concern is that in 
an effort to kill this so-called dinosaur 
we are really taking a sledge hammer 
to kill a beetle, small beetle. 


S 38 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

I agree with the Senators that the 
rule has been abused. Would the Senators 
agree with me that, in the abuse 
of this rule, it has been most abused in 
preventing, or attempting to prevent, 
the taking up of a measure or matter 
or nomination? Would the Senators 
agree with me on that? 

The able Senator from Iowa cited the 
number of times that the ‘‘filibuster’’ 
was resorted to last year, or in the last 
session of Congress or in the last Congress, 
the 103d Congress, and I have a 
feeling that most of those instances to 
which he alluded were instances in 
which the effort was being made to proceed 
to take up a measure or matter or 
nomination and there was the threat of 
a filibuster at least which perhaps had 
some impact on the taking up of the 
measure. 

Would the Senators agree that it is 
there, in the taking up of a measure, 
that the real problem lies, or at least 
that that has been our experience in recent 
months and years, not so much 
after the Senate is on a matter or 
measure or nomination but proceeding 
to the matter? Would the Senators 
agree? 

Mr. HARKIN. I do not know if the 
question is directed to both of us, but if 
I might respond—— 

Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent 
that I may ask this question and retain 
my rights to the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. HARKIN. I respond to the Senator 
by saying that that has been a 
problem. But I would also note that 
last year there were three or four instances—
I am a little unclear—of when 
the filibuster was used on disagreeing 
with amendments of the House, appointing 
conferees, and insisting on 
Senate amendments. That can also be 
filibustered. 

Mr. BYRD. But wouldn’t—— 

Mr. HARKIN. Even after the whole 
measure has been passed. 

Mr. BYRD. Would not the Senator 
agree that filibusters used in such instances 
as he has just related here are 
not the filibusters which have caused 
the Senate the problems of abuse which 
most Senators and I perceive as being 
problems? Do the Senators not agree if 
real problems have arisen—if there 
have been real problems, and assuming 
that there have been, assuming that 
what we call filibusters were really filibusters 
on motions to proceed—would 
the Senators not agree that on motions 
to proceed most of these filibusters, so-
called filibusters, have occurred? 

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I 
may respond to the distinguished Senator 
from West Virginia, it is true—and 
I do not have the statistics in front of 
me, but my recollection tells me that a 
good number of the filibusters that 
have occurred have occurred on the 
motion to proceed. But it is my opinion 
that the fact that many filibusters occurred 
on the motion to proceed does 
not encourage or lead to the conclusion 
that the problem is the motion to proceed. 
The filibusters have occurred on 

the motion to proceed because that has 
generally been the first opportunity 
that opponents of a measure have had 
to filibuster. The fact that a measure 
can be blocked by conducting a filibuster 
of the motion to proceed, of 
course, makes it even more frustrating. 
The very attempt to proceed to a matter 
of legislation or a nomination can 
be filibustered before the Senate even 
gets to the substance of it, but breaking 
the filibuster of the motion to proceed 
does not eliminate the threat of a 
filibuster of the bill itself. 

This Senator can remember at least 
one example which makes the point 
that I am trying to make. On product 
liability reform, my recollection is 
that in the 102d Congress the filibuster 
occurred on the motion to proceed and 
cloture could not be obtained. In the 
103d Congress, because of changes of attitude, 
because of changes of the membership 
of the Senate, because a number 
of Members of the Chamber had 
committed to at least let the Chamber 
get to the substance, it was apparent 
that the filibuster of the motion to 
proceed would be broken, that cloture 
would be granted. But then a filibuster 
did begin on the bill itself, after the 
motion to proceed was granted, and 
that filibuster was again successful in 
blocking the will of the majority. 

So I would most respectfully say to 
the Senator from West Virginia that it 
does seem to me that, though the filibuster 
has been more frequently a 
problem on the motion to proceed, the 
problem is the filibuster. And if once 
the opponents of a measure, a minority, 
are not successful and let the motion 
to proceed be agreed to, then this 
minority has the right to frustrate the 
will of the majority on the substance of 
the matter once it comes before the 
Chamber. 

Mr. BYRD. Well, Mr. President, I 
want to protect the right of the minority 
on a matter of substance in particular. 
But do the Senators not agree that 
most of the cloture motions that have 
been laid down by the majority leader 
in the past few years have been laid 
down on motions to proceed? Would the 
Senators not agree to that? 

Mr. HARKIN. I would agree to that. I 
would agree, I think—and I have a 
table here on that—and the Senator is 
right. 

Mr. BYRD. All right. 

Mr. HARKIN. Most of them have 
been on motions to proceed. 

Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. 

Now, before the Senator leaves the 
floor, why do we want to use this cloture—
why do we want to use this 
sledgehammer to eliminate the potential 
filibuster on a motion to proceed? 
That is where the problem has arisen. 
Our friends—now in the majority, then 
in the minority—objected to the taking 
up of measures. Consequently the majority 
leader put in a cloture motion; 2 
days later the vote occurred. 

Now if, as the Senator from Iowa has 
stated, it is true that most of the so-
called filibusters, I say so-called because—
I will explain that further in a 

moment—so-called filibusters have occurred 
on motions to proceed, and the 
Senator from Iowa says that is the 
case, if that is true, then we do not 
need this. We do not need this. We do 
not need to kill the opportunity for unlimited 
debate in order to get at that. 
Have the Senators read rule VIII, paragraph 
2, of the Standing Rules of the 
Senate? Here is what it says. ‘‘All motions 
made during the first two hours 
of a new legislative day to proceed to 
the consideration of any matter’’—any 
matter except a motion to change the 
rules, any matter—‘‘shall be determined 
without debate.’’ 

Let me read that again for the edification 
of all Senators and all who are 
listening. Here in the Senate rules, 
paragraph 2, rule VIII. 

All motions made during the first two 
hours of a new legislative day to proceed to 
the consideration of any matter shall be determined 
without debate, except motions to 
proceed to the consideration of any motion, 
resolution, or proposal to change any of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate shall be debatable. 
Motions made after the first two hours 
of a new legislative day to proceed to the 
consideration of bills and resolutions are debatable. 


Now here it is in plain, unmistakable 
language in the Senate rules, rule VIII, 
that a motion to proceed to take up a 
matter other than a rules change during 
the first 2 hours of a new legislative 
day shall be determined without 
debate. There you are. Why does not a 
majority leader use rule VIII? It is 
here. It has been here all the time. 

Mr. President, I was majority leader 
and I was the Secretary of the Democratic 
Conference, beginning in 1967, 
for 4 years. I sat on this floor and did 
Mr. Mansfield’s floor work for him as 
Secretary of the Democratic Conference. 
And beginning in 1971 I sat on 
this floor as Democratic whip and did 
Mr. Mansfield’s floor work for him. He 
was the majority leader. 

And in 1977 I was elected majority 
leader. I was elected majority leader 
for 2 years and then reelected in 1979 
for 2 years. Then the Republicans took 
over the control of the Senate after the 
1980 election. I was minority leader for 
6 years. Then I became majority leader 
again for 2 years, the 100th Congress. 
That rule was there all the time that I 
was leader. I never had any big problems. 


I will tell you, rules VII and VIII, I 
believe, have, if it is researched, if it is 
researched by the Journal clerk—I 
have a feeling that rules VII and VIII 
have not been used since I was majority 
leader. Rules VII and VIII have not 
been used since I was majority leader. 
I think that is correct, unless it happened 
one day when I was in a committee 
meeting and was not aware of what 
was going on on the floor. I will say 
this as a former majority leader and as 
a former minority leader. I will say 
that it is sometimes difficult. But the 
rule is there which allows for a motion 
to proceed, a nondebatable motion to 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 39 

proceed. And I have used it. I have used 
it. I have used it when our Republican 
friends did not want to take up something. 
I used that rule. 

Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield? 

Mr. BYRD. Let me just complete my 
thought and then I will be glad to 
yield. 

A majority leader has enormous 
power when it comes to the schedule of 
the Senate, the scheduling of bills and 
resolutions, and the programming of 
the Senate schedule. The majority 
leader has first recognition power and 
that is a big arrow in his arsenal. 

He has the power of first recognition. 
Nobody can get recognition before the 
majority leader. If he has the power of 
first recognition, then he can make a 
motion that is nondebatable. He can sit 
down if he wants to. If someone wants 
to put in a quorum call, that is OK. Let 
the quorums chew up the rest of the 2 
hours. That motion is in there. That 
nondebatable motion is still pending 
before the Senate after that 2 hours. At 
least that is the way I recall it. But 
there is a nondebatable motion. Why 
has not rule VII or VIII been used? 

So we have had all of these motions 
to proceed. The Republicans objected. 
Then we slapped in cloture motions. 
That has been called a filibuster. There 
is no filibuster. That is a threat to filibuster. 
But again, the majority leader 
has the power to go to something else. 
Once that cloture motion is in, he does 
not have to waste 2 days. He has the 
power to go to something else, take up 
something else. And then 2 days later 
the cloture motion ripens and you vote 
on that cloture motion. It does not 
mean that we have been losing time. 
We just moved on to another measure 
in the meantime. 

So I say to my friends before we get 
all steamed up and start referring to 
something around here as a leviathan, 
dragon, or a big lizard, whatever, let us 
read the rules and see what we all have 
here. And let us use them. I will be 
glad to yield. 

Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for 
yielding. 

I asked my staff. It was either last 
year or the year before when I first 
started getting involved in this that I 
then came to the majority leader, Mr. 
Mitchell, with that same proposal because 
I am trying to remember the bill 
we were trying to get up that was being 
filibustered. I had checked on this legislative 
day. The response that I got 
was what difference does it make? If we 
are going to filibuster, we might as 
well do it on a motion to proceed as 
anything else. It does not make any 
difference. 

In other words, there are six hurdles. 
There is the motion to proceed. There 
is the bill, disagreement with the 
House, insist on amendments, appoint 
conferees—there are six when we get 
over there. The Senator from West Virginia 
says we take down the first rule. 
It still leaves five rules. Every one of 
those can be filibustered and we are 
right back in the same stew again. I be


lieve that is why rule VIII is not used 
more often because it does not really 
make much difference. 

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it makes a 
lot of difference. We so programmed 
ourselves around here that we get 
unanimous consent. And I started a lot 
of it. So I cannot wash my hands and 
walk away. I did a lot of this programming 
myself; program the next day; 
morning business. I daresay that half 
of the Senators do not know what 
morning business is. They do not know 
the difference between the morning 
hour and morning business. 

I do not mean to cast aspersions on 
them. But I hear a lot of Senators talking 
about how we should change the 
rules. They do not know the rules. 
They do not know the rules. They 
think morning business is a period 
when there is a period for speeches. 
Morning business is not a period for 
speeches. Under rules VII and VIII, 
speeches are not to be made in morning 
business. Morning business is a period 
for the offering of petitions and memorials 
and bills and resolutions and so 
forth, but no speeches. A lot of Senators 
think, well, morning business. I 
would imagine if they went out to a 
high school or a college and answered 
some questions on the Senate rules, 
they would talk about morning business, 
that is the time you make speeches. 
Morning business is not a time for 
speeches. 

So we get consent, not that there be 
a limitation on speeches in morning 
business because there are not supposed 
to be any speeches, but that Senators 
be permitted to speak in morning 
business for not to exceed. 

I say all of that to say this, Mr. 
President. The rule is here. I daresay 
that if Mr. DOLE gets a notion to call 
up a measure he will probably resort to 
paragraph 2, rule VIII and he may go 
back to using rules VII and VIII. I hope 
we will. I do not want to see these rules 
atrophy from misuse. The Senate is 
being programmed too much. As I say, 
I guess I started some of it. But it has 
gone too far. 

Here are the rules. The majority 
leader has all of his power of first recognition. 
Any majority leader can find 
a way to make a motion during the 
first 2 hours of a new legislative day. A 
lot of Senators do not know what that 
means—new legislative day. They probably 
do not know the difference between 
a legislative day and a calendar 
day. I do not want to be unfair to my 
colleagues. But they have other things 
to do, things that there are headlines 
in, votes to be made back home. Who 
wants to fool with these old Senate 
rules? It is not interesting reading. It 
will not compare with Milton, Dante, 
Roman history or the history of England. 
This is dry reading. Who wants to 
fool around and spend their hours reading 
these old dry rules? No headlines 
are made. 

So I hope that we will start using 
rules VII and VIII. I think Senators 
would get over here then and use the 5


minute rule and speak on matters more 
often. 

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator 
yield? 

Mr. BYRD. Yes. I ask that I retain 
my right to the floor, not that I think 
anyone is going to try to take it away 
from me. 

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the distinguished 
Senator from West Virginia. 
There is no better not only student but 
teacher of the rules who understands 
the rules better than the Senator from 
West Virginia. I respect him greatly for 
that. 

I would make this point and I do 
think the Senator has made an important 
point in saying that the problem 
of the filibuster, to use the term we 
have been using and perhaps in some 
measure agreeing on it, the misuse of 
the filibuster has arisen most frequently 
on the motion to proceed. I 
must say that if there was a way that 
the Chamber could limit or eliminate 
the opportunity to filibuster on the 
motion to proceed I would certainly 
consider that to be a step forward—to 
put it in a more clear way, if I may, a 
step toward diminishing the misuse of 
the power of the filibuster. But it does 
seem to me that the problem here has 
arisen most frequently on the motion 
to proceed but the problem remains the 
filibuster which is the ability in this 
Senator’s opinion of a minority to frustrate 
the will of 51 Members of this 
Senate to represent their constituents 
and get something done. It has arisen 
most frequently on the motion to proceed 
because that is the first time it 
could arise. 

My friend and colleague from Iowa 
has talked about the six occasions in 
which in the consideration of a typical 
matter here in the Senate a filibuster 
could occur. In fact, if one considered 
amendments and the opportunity to 
filibuster amendments, there are even 
more than six. But let us talk about 
the six. It is as if there were six hurdles 
or six obstacles on the passage of a 
measure. And it is true that the first 
hurdle is the motion to proceed. So the 
filibuster has arisen most often on that 
because it is the first hurdle. If we 
eliminated that hurdle, I would say 
that would be a step toward eliminating 
or diminishing the misuse. But the 
fact other hurdles would remain and 
would be there is an opportunity to 
frustrate the will of the majority and 
to bring gridlock. 

I say that with great respect for my 
distinguished colleague from West Virginia. 
I thank him for yielding the 
floor. 

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have 
great respect for both Senators. I have 
great admiration for them. Mr. HARKIN 
serves on my Appropriations Committee. 
He has his heart in this matter. 
But as one who has been a leader of the 
majority and the leader of the party 
when in the minority, I can say to my 
friends that the majority leader, whose 
job it is and responsibility it is to bring 
up matters—that is not the responsibil



S 40 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

ity of the minority leader—the majority 
leader, with his power of first recognition, 
with his majority votes to 
back him up on most measures, certainly 
on taking up measures, he can 
get measures up. There might come an 
occasion now and then in the effort to 
proceed to take up something when he 
would have to use cloture. That is all 
right. I used it a few times, too. But 
that has been the problem, as I have 
observed it here in recent years, the 
‘‘filibuster,’’ because it really was not 
a filibuster. It was the failure to give 
consent to take up a matter. Consent is 
needed to take up a matter, except on 
a motion. So if we can ask unanimous 
consent to take up a matter, to proceed 
to a matter, any one Senator can object, 
and that may appear to be a filibuster. 
That may appear to be a threat 
of a filibuster. 

Well, a majority leader can call that 
threat. He does not have to roll over 
and play dead. Time and time again— 
do not worry about these holds, do not 
worry about them. I have heard that 
argument. Senators have holds on 
things. We ought to stop that. Well, 
when I was leader, I recognized a hold 
only for a time, and many Senators 
have placed a hold on a piece of legislation 
just so they can be notified when 
that piece of legislation is about to 
come up. They want to be notified. 
They do not want it to be taken up 
without their being consulted. 

I never tolerated a hold; I never allowed 
any hold to keep me from attempting 
to take up a measure. If 
someone had a hold on a nomination, I 
would go to the Republican leader and 
I would say: You better tell Senator So 
and So that I am going to move to take 
up that nomination. I hope he will give 
me consent, but if he does not and I see 
he has had a hold 2 weeks, 3 weeks, or 
a month, or whatever it is, then I am 
going to move, and the hold would 
break. If it did not, we just moved to 
take it up. 

So, Mr. President, to those, especially 
inside the Senate, who do not 
understand, I cannot blame the people 
on the outside for not understanding. I 
can understand how editors of the 
newspapers around the country might 
not understand when Senators themselves 
do not understand. We have a 
rule here that allows taking up a measure 
without debate. 

Let me say that I hope the Republican 
leader will resort to rule VIII 
once in a while, if for nothing else but 
to recall to all of us that it is in the 
rule book. 

(Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.) 

Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield? 

Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will yield for a 
question. 

Mr. HARKIN. This is very instructive 
to me, also. As the Senator from Connecticut 
said, there is no one who 
knows his rules better and more in 
depth than the Senator from West Virginia. 
I like this debate because I am 
learning from him. 

I have to have something cleared up 
for me, if the Senator would be so kind. 
Let us assume that the majority leader 
does use rule VIII to bring up a motion 
to proceed, which then would not be debatable; 
let us say that I was opposed 
to the measure, and say I had two or 
three other people opposed to the 
measure that indicated we were going 
to filibuster the motion to proceed. So 
the majority leader says: We will get 
around HARKIN; we will bring it up 
under rule VIII. There is nothing I can 
do about it. It is nondebatable. But 
what is to prevent me from saying 
when the bill comes up we will filibuster 
it now? 

Mr. BYRD. Sure, that is all right. A 
minority ought to have a right somewhere 
to debate and to resort to unlimited 
debate. There are two things that 
make the Senate, two things in particular, 
aside from the Senate’s judicial 
powers, its executive powers, and 
its investigative powers; there are two 
things that make it the premier upper 
body in the world. One is the right to 
amend. The Constitution gives it that 
right to amend, even on revenue bills 
which originate in the House. The 
other factor is the right of unlimited 
debate. 

I sought to get the campaign financing 
reform measure up in the 100th 
Congress, in 1987, and our Republican 
friends would not give me a unanimous 
consent to take it up. So one day—I am 
getting to the point the Senator 
raised—I said to the Republican leader, 
when I had the floor: I wonder if the 
leader would give me consent to proceed 
to the consideration of whatever 
the bill number was, the campaign financing 
reform bill. He said: I do not 
think so; I think we want to talk a 
while about that. I said: Well, I wish 
the Senator would let me take this up. 
He said: Well, Senator MCCONNELL 
might want to talk about it. I said: 
Right there he is; ask him. The Republican 
leader asked Senator MCCONNELL, 
and he said Senator MCCONNELL wanted 
to talk. 

Well, Mr. President, I was in a position 
right then to move to take that 
bill up, and it is a nondebatable motion. 
You see, it was a new legislative 
day, and it was during that 2 hours. I 
am now in a position to move. I said: 
So, Mr. Leader, if you give me unanimous 
consent, we will save 15 minutes, 
or if you will not give me unanimous 
consent, we will just vote right now, 
and we will vote up or down. He said: 
Well, give me a few minutes to talk 
with my colleagues. I said: Sure, how 
much time you want? He said: Oh, 20, 
30 minutes. I said: Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
stand in recess for 30 minutes and that 
I be recognized at the reconvening of 
the Senate, and at that point no time 
be charged against the recess, and that 
I retain my rights at that point as of 
the status quo. We recessed for 30 minutes 
and went out and Mr. DOLE came 
back and said: OK, we will give you 

consent. Then they filibustered the 
measure. 

I offered a cloture motion eight 
times—more than any majority leader 
has ever offered on any measure. Unlike 
Robert Bruce, who succeeded on 
the seventh time after he had seen that 
spider spin his web, I failed eight 
times. Do you think I was frustrated? 
Of course I was. But they had a right. 
They were exercising their rights. They 
were in the minority, but a minority 
can be right. A minority can be right. 
So I have always defended the rights of 
the minority, whether I was in the majority 
or minority, because I also remember 
that we can be in the minor-
ity—and we are now. I remember, too, 
that this is not a democracy. 

With 260 million people, would anybody 
stand up and claim that this 
could be a democracy? This is a Repub


lic. It is a representative democracy. 
The people speak through their elected 
representatives. So a minority may be 
over there or may be over here on a 
given measure, or a minority may be a 
combined minority. But that minority 
may represent a majority of the people. 
That is the purpose. That is why unlimited 
debate is something we should 
never, never give away—unlimited debate; 
right of unlimited debate. 
I have been in the House of Representatives. 
I have been in the House 
of Representatives before I came here. 
I do not want to make the Senate a 
second House of Representatives. There 
is a place for both in the constitutional 
scheme. Each has its role to play in its 
own proper sphere. The Senate ought 
not change its role. 

I may want to filibuster, to use the 
word. I may want to use it someday to 
protect poor little West Virginia and 
her rights. This is the forum of the 
States. We are here to represent 
States. And the State of West Virginia, 
the State of Iowa, the State of Kentucky, 
the State of Mississippi, each of 
these States is equal to the great State 
of California with its 30-odd million— 
equal. We speak for the States, and it 
is the only forum in the Government in 
which the States are equally represented—
equally represented. 

Now, if we do not have the right for 
unlimited debate, these poor little old 
States like West Virginia, they will be 
trampled underfoot. We have three 
votes in the House. Now in the House, 
we had six votes. Now we have half 
that many in the House, three votes. 

Mr. President, we had better stop, 
look, and listen before we give away 
this right of unlimited debate. What is 
wrong with using the rules? My friends 
did not like it. I did not like it when 
Mr. DOLE used the rules on me when he 
was in the majority. I did not like it, 
but I said he has a right to do it; he is 
playing by the rules. 

Mr. President, I came prepared to 
speak not long, but let me say a few 
words in accordance with what I had 
planned. 

The filibuster has become a target 
for rebuke in this efficiency-obsessed 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 41 

age in which we live. We have instant 
coffee, instant potatoes to mix, instant 
this and instant that. So everything 
must be done in an instant; must be 
done in a hurry. 

I lived in an earlier age. I remember 
when Lindbergh flew across the ocean 
in a plane that carried a 5,500-pound 
load. He had five sandwiches. He ate 
one and one-half of them on his way. 
He flew 3,600 miles in 331/2 hours, sometimes 
10 feet above water, sometimes 
10,000 feet. Crowds gathered to see him 
off; crowds gathered in Paris to see him 
land. 

He flew over Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, 
at the great speed of 100 miles an 
hour. That is what the New York 
Times said. That is the paper that 
prints everything there is fit to print. 
I wish other newspapers would follow 
that same rule. Great speed. Flew over 
at great speed, it said—100 miles an 
hour. 

JOHN GLENN went around the Earth, I 
would assume, at a speed of something 
like, I would imagine, as I recall he 
traveled around the Earth in about 80 
minutes, something like that. That 
would be what? Eighteen thousand 
miles an hour. 

Anyhow, everything has to be done in 
a hurry. We have to bring efficiency to 
this Senate. That was not what the 
Framers had in mind. 

Recently, much of the talk of abolishing 
filibusters was coming from the 
other body, but apparently the criticism 
has begun to seep in the Senate 
Chamber, as well. 

The filibuster is one of the easier targets 
in this town. It does not take 
much imagination to decry long-winded 
speeches and to deplore delay by a 
small number of determined zealots as 
getting in the way of the greater good. 

It does, however, take more than a 
little thought to understand the true 
purpose of the tactic known as filibustering 
and to appreciate its historic 
importance in protecting the viewpoint 
of the minority. 

In many ways, the filibuster is the 
single most important device ever employed 
to ensure that the Senate remains 
truly the unique protector of the 
rights of the people that it has been 
throughout our history. 

I believe that it is always worthwhile 
to try to educate the public and hopefully 
any new Members who have not 
yet fully grasped the noble purpose fulfilled 
by this much maligned exercise 
known as the Senate filibuster. 

Mr. President, let it be clearly understood 
that I favor a change in the filibuster 
rule. I will eliminate filibusters 
on the motion to proceed to take up a 
measure or matter other than a matter 
affecting a rules change. I would favor 
changing the rules to provide that 
there be a motion to proceed limited to 
2 hours of debate or 1 hour of debate. I 
have no problem with that. Because 
that to me appears to have been, the 
last few years, where the real abuse has 
lain, real abuse of the rule. If we eliminate 
that, Senators should retain full 

rights to debate at any length the 
measure or matter, once the Senate 
has proceeded to take it up. 

So let us have that change in the 
rules. That will get rid of most of the 
so-called filibusters. 

A lot of these are not really filibusters. 
What is involved is a motion to 
proceed. Because unanimous consent 
could not be gotten to take up the matter, 
one Senator or two Senators were 
objecting, so the motion to proceed was 
made and then immediately a cloture 
motion was laid down. 

Now, that cloture rule came as a result 
of real filibusters, and what was 
perceived at that time as an abuse of 
unlimited debate. That is why the cloture 
rule was created in 1917. 

As the Senator has appropriately 
pointed out—and I have listened to him 
carefully and he has revealed to me 
that he has read a great deal of history 
concerning these rules—may I say to 
the Senator that I have likewise read a 
great deal of it. I have likewise written 
a great deal on it, and I have likewise 
experienced the use of it and experienced 
dealing with it as majority leader, 
as minority leader, as whip, and as 
secretary of the Democratic conference. 


Mr. HARKIN. Senator, much of the 
history I have read. 

Mr. BYRD. I could tell that just by 
listening. And I compliment the Senator. 


By the way, all of this section here, 
‘‘The Filibuster 1789–1917,’’ I read the 
old CONGRESSIONAL RECORDs. I went 
through the old CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. I read those debates by Benjamin 
Tillman. I read them. I did the 
footnoting in this book. I did not have 
a staffer do that footnoting. I did it. I 
read those CONGRESSIONAL RECORDs. 

And so I have read the history. And I 
have helped to make a lot of the history. 
And I have helped to write a lot. 
And I feel very deeply that as long as 
we have a Senate in which there is unlimited 
debate, the liberties of the 
American people will always be protected. 
I think that we change that 
rule at our peril, and at the peril of the 
liberties of the American people. 

One of the filibuster, so-called filibuster, 
is of ancient origin. Cato ordered 
a filibuster. Cato the Younger. 
His sister married Brutus. Marcus Junius 
Brutus. Cato the Younger. He committed 
suicide in the year 46, 46 B.C., 
after he had heard that Caesar has won 
the battle of Thapsus. He committed 
suicide. Cato. Marcus Porcius Cato 
Uticensis committed suicide. He admonished 
all of his men, the officers in 
his military, to leave Utica because 
Caesar was approaching. He admonished 
his son to give himself over to 
Caesar. Cato himself did none of these 
things. He elected to read Plato’s book 
on the soul. Phaedo. And after he had 
read that book, his friends had taken 
his sword from beneath his pillow, fearful 
he might use it against himself. 
And he asked them to send it back. 
And a little boy came carrying the 

sword back into the room. Cato felt of 
its point, felt of its edge, said, ‘‘Now, I 
am master of myself.’’ And a little 
later he plunged it into his abdomen. 
Cato. We need more Catos in the Senate. 


The Cato in the year 60 B.C. resorted 
to a filibuster. Caesar wanted to stand 
as a candidate for counsel. He had to be 
in the city to do that. He also wanted 
to be rewarded a triumph for his victories 
in Spain. For that he had to be 
on the outside of the city and come in 
a triumph. He had to give up one or the 
other, but his friends in the Senate 
sought to introduce legislation that 
would allow him to stand as the candidate 
while on the outside of the city, 
but Cato, and I say it in here better, 
‘‘Cato spun out the hours by speaking 
until the Sun went down.’’ In the 
Roman Senate, Sun went down, that 
was the end of the session. So he spun 
out the day talking until the Senate 
adjourned. And so we see a successful 
filibuster occurs in the Roman Senate 
2055 years ago. Not bad. 2055 years ago. 
So, it is a matter of ancient origin. 

Did the Senator want me to yield? 

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was 
just fascinated by listening to the history 
lesson is all. 

Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent 
that I may yield for a statement, if the 
Senator wishes to make it, without losing 
my right to the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection. 

Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator. It is always instructive to 
engage in the debates with the Senator 
from West Virginia who is a great student 
of Roman history. I have always 
enjoyed listening to him tell about the 
different Roman battles. Always very 
instructive. I am not a student of 
Roman history at all and do not pretend 
to be. I find it fascinating. 

I tend to think that we in our great 
American experiment embarked upon 
something quite different perhaps than 
what the Roman Senate was. I think 
our roots, again, go back to the Magna 
Carta, the great charter of King John, 
and to the parliamentary procedures of 
Great Britain, of England. 

In 1604 the Parliament of Great Britain 
adopted what was then known as a 
motion for the previous question to 
bring to finality debate and to move to 
the merits of the proposition. That was 
in 1604. When our Constitution, and I 
pose this in a manner of a question to 
the Senator from West Virginia because 
this is another branch of the argument 
on the filibuster, sort of the 
branch that I had been arguing on is 
the basis that a filibuster ought to be 
used to slow down, temper legislation, 
alert the public, change minds, but 
should not be used as a measure whereby 
a small minority can totally keep 
the majority from voting on the merits 
of a bill. That is one branch. 

The other branch is the constitutional 
branch. The Senator from West 
Virginia said that we, at our peril, I believe, 
give up this right of unlimited 


S 42 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

debate. From whence does this right 
spring? It is not mentioned in the Constitution. 
At least I cannot find it in 
the Constitution. 

In fact, the Constitution, article I, 
section 3, outlines what the Senate 
shall be. Two Senators from each State 
chosen by the legislature, which was 
changed by the 18th amendment and 
made Senators popularly elected, goes 
on to tell what Senators do. They each 
get a vote. The Vice President will be 
President of the Senate but will have 
no vote unless they be equally divided. 
Then it goes on to tell all of the different 
cases wherein there has to be 
more than a majority vote. Five cases. 

I postulate a question to the Senator 
from West Virginia. Let us suppose 
that an election were held and 90 Members 
of the Senate were elected from 
one party; let us say that those 90 
Members then decided that they were 
going to change the rules of the Senate. 
And they did change the rules of 
the Senate. 

And then they put in the Senate a 
rule that said that no changes in the 
rules could be done unless 90 percent 
agreed. Not two-thirds, but 90 would 
have to agree to change the rules, and 
that 90 Senators would have to reach 
that agreement. It probably would 
never happen again, 90 Members of the 
same party, but then that rule would 
go on in perpetuity. So then does that 
not lead to a possibility of a Senate 
setting up a supermajority that completely 
does away with the will of the 
majority to enact legislation? It sort of 
is an extension, and it is the extreme of 
what we have here, I think, with a filibuster. 


So I ask the Senator, from whence 
does this right spring of this unlimited 
debate? I find it not in the Constitution. 


Mr. BYRD. The right of freedom of 
speech was publicly accorded to both 
Commons and the House of Lords by 
Henry V in 1407. He reigned from 1399 
to 1413. He publicly declared that the 
Commons, members of both Houses of 
Parliament, had the right to speak and 
speak without any fear of being challenged 
in any other place. That right 
was written into the English Bill of 
Rights, article 9—the English Bill of 
Rights, which was enacted in December 
1689. 

William III and Mary were offered 
the joint sovereignty by Commoners, 
the House of Commons, when James II, 
just before he left England and went to 
the court of France, never to return to 
England, they offered to William and 
Mary the joint sovereignty. And in 
early 1689, William and Mary were 
crowned joint sovereigns. But first of 
all they had to agree to a Bill of 
Rights. And in that Bill of Rights, in 
the nineth article, there is a provision 
that members of Parliament should not 
be questioned in any place but Parliament. 
And in our own Constitution, 
article I, section 6, we find virtually 
the same language, no Member of either 
House may be questioned in any 

other place, or anything said in debate, 
so on and so on. 

So there was the right of freedom of 
speech. Our English forebears recognized 
that important right, and they 
wrote it into the Bill of Rights, the 
English Bill of Rights. And our Constitution 
forebears, who knew much 
about the English struggle, who knew 
much about Roman history, who knew 
much about Montesquieu and Hobbs 
and Moore and all of the other great 
philosophers, they wrote it into our 
Constitution. 

We have freedom of speech. The 
Roman Senate, under the Republic, 
which lasted from 509 B.C. up to the 
Battle of Actium in 31 B.C., the Roman 
Republic had freedom of speech in the 
Senate, and there was a check on freedom 
of speech on the length of speeches 
first instituted by Augustus—Gaius Julius 
Caesar Octavianus, given the title 
of Augustus by an innervated Roman 
Senate that had lost its nerve, lost its 
vision and lost its way. Augustus finally 
put an end to this business of 
freedom of speech in the Senate. He 
reigned from 27 B.C. to 14 A.D. 

So it has its roots in antiquity. It is 
a property, yeah; it is far more than a 
property, it is a right that is cherished 
by free men: The right of freedom of 
debate. 

Take away that right and you take 
away my liberties. You take away my 
right of freedom of debate as an elected 
representative of the people, and you 
take away their liberties. It is a right 
that Englishmen have known for centuries 
for which they struggled against 
monarchs. 

The Senate, as the Senator pointed 
out early today, first started out with 
the previous question in the Senate. 
That was discarded. Aaron Burr, when 
he made that great speech after he had 
murdered Alexander Hamilton in 
Weehawken, NJ, and had presided over 
the Senate trial of Samuel Chase, I believe 
it was, made a speech to the Senate, 
his last speech before he went out 
the door for the last time, and he recommended 
that the Senate do away 
with the previous question. 

So we have had unlimited debate in 
the Senate now for 200 years, and surely 
with 200 years of trial and testing, 
we should know by now it is something 
to be prized beyond measure. 

And so it is not a matter of pride and 
prerogative and privilege and power 
with this Senator. It is a matter not 
only of protecting this institution, it is 
a matter of protecting the liberties of 
free men under our Constitution. And 
as long as I can stand on this floor and 
speak, I can protect the liberties of my 
people. If I abuse the power by threatening 
to filibuster on motions to proceed, 
take away that power of mine to 
abuse. Let us change the rule and allow 
a motion to proceed under a debate 
limitation of 2 hours, 1 hour, or whatever, 
except on motions to proceed to a 
rules change. I am for that. 

And so by doing that, the Senator 
will have performed a great service. He 

will have eliminated—he will have 
eliminated—the source of the irritations 
and aggravations that have permeated 
through this body over the last 
few years of most of those so-called 
filibusters. 

They were not filibusters. They were 
simply motions to take up a matter 
that were objected to and immediately 
a cloture motion being thrown down. 
That cloture motion was created to 
shut off debates on filibusters. And yet 
the cloture motion was used to get a 
vote on a motion to proceed. 

So I think it has been blown out of 
proportion a great deal, but I agree 
that that rule has been abused to that 
extent. I have said that continued 
abuse of that rule will result in taking 
away the right of Senators to have unlimited 
debate. I see that danger. And 
I am trying to protect against that 
danger. So I would agree that we make 
that kind of rules change. 

As far as I am concerned, we could go 
back to the two-thirds rule rather than 
the three-fifths—two-thirds of those 
present and voting. That would ensure 
that Senators come to the floor and 
vote. Where we have 60 votes, 39 or 40 
can leave town. The other side has to 
produce 60 votes. 

So if the Senate wanted to change it 
back to two-thirds of those present and 
voting, fine. As he pointed out directly, 
the present rule was reached through 
compromise, those who thought the 
two-thirds too difficult and those who 
thought that a majority was not 
enough, so we arrived at the present 
rule. But I am not unalterably against 
change if it is change for what I see 
would be for the better. I think that 
would be for the better. But I am 
against change, I am against emasculating 
the filibuster rule. 

In the ‘‘Lady of the Lake,’’ I guess it 
was Fitz-James who said; 

Come one, come all. This rock shall fly 

From its firm base as soon as I. 

That is the way I feel about the filibuster: 


Come one, come all. This rock shall fly 

From its firm base as soon as I. 

So it is not a matter of power and 
privilege and prerogative, as the Senator 
has said, and pride. It is a matter 
of pride in this institution with me. 
That is where the pride is, pride in this 
institution and pride in the Constitution. 


I wish Senators would develop an institutional 
memory. Stop coming over 
here from the House of Representatives 
and immediately trying to make this a 
second House of Representatives. The 
Senate was created for a purpose in the 
minds of those great framers. And the 
test of time has proved that they were 
right and that they were wise. 

I had intended to read several chapters 
from my book, volume two, but I 
have enjoyed the exchange with my 
friends to the extent that I feel no need 
of proceeding as I had earlier intended. 

Let me just call attention to my 
book—and I get no royalties on this 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 43 

book—‘‘The Senate, 1789–1989, Addresses 
on the History of the Senate.’’ This 
is volume two. Volume two is the Senator’s 
copy. Volume one was a chronological 
history of the U.S. Senate. A 
history of the United States Senate is 
American history. But volume two I intended 
for Senators to read. 

What is in it? Well, there are chapters 
on treaties, and on impeachment 
trials, and on other matters that are 
fairly unique to the Senate. I hope Senators 
will read my chapter on impeachment 
trials. Some Senators who claim 
to be lawyers cannot, really cannot, 
get away from the idea that they are 
still in a courtroom and that an impeachment 
trial is a trial in the sense 
of a civil or criminal trial that is being 
tried in a court of law. 

I hope that Senators who listen tonight 
and those who read will take me 
up on that and go back and read my 
chapter on impeachment trials because 
there will be some more impeachment 
trials as time comes on. And I have 
chapters on committees, on the various 
officers of the Senate. 

But in this respect which we are now 
discussing, I would suggest they begin 
on page 93, chapter 5, titled ‘‘Extended 
Debate, Filibusters, 1789 to 1917.’’ There 
they will find written down the instance 
to which I earlier referred when 
Plutarch reported that Cato opposed 
Caesar’s request and ‘‘attempted to 
prevent his success by gaining time; 
with which views he spun out the debate 
till it was too late to conclude 
upon any thing that day.’’ 

So that was that successful filibuster 
2,055 years ago. 

Then this gives the history of filibusters 
when filibusters were real filibusters, 
as Mr. HARKIN stated earlier. 
Back in the 19th century, they had real 
filibusters, and in the early part of this 
century. And there have been some real 
ones since I have been in the Senate, 
real in the sense that it took days and 
days and days to reach a decision. And 
the debate was germane, at least during 
the filibusters that I experienced in 
the Senate. 

I mentioned three in particular. The 
civil rights debate, 1964. I was not a 
leader at that time, but I participated 
in that debate. I spoke 14 hours and 13 
minutes during that debate. That was a 
bill that was before the Senate for a 
total of 77 days including Saturdays, 
Sundays, and holidays. It was actually 
debated 57 days, 6 of which were Saturdays. 
We have had some real filibusters. 
Still the bill was not passed until 
9 days after cloture was voted. Hence, 
103 days had passed between March 9 
when the motion was made to take up 
the bill and final passage on June 19. 

Now, this was the civil rights filibuster. 
Then there was a filibuster on 
the natural gas bill, in 1977 I believe it 
was. And then I speak of the filibuster 
that occurred on the campaign financing 
reform bill, 1987 and 1988. That 
spread across a period of 2 years. 

So I have seen filibusters. I have 
helped to break them. There are few 
Senators in this body who were here 

when I broke the filibuster on the natural 
gas bill. Two Senators, Senator 
Metzenbaum and former Senator 
Abourezk, tied up the Senate for 13 
days and 1 night—I believe it was 13 
days and 1 night—and in that time we 
had disposed of a half-dozen amendments. 
So I asked Mr. Mondale, the 
Vice President, to go please sit in the 
chair; I wanted to make some points of 
order and create some new precedents 
that would break these filibusters. 

So he got in the chair, and Howard 
Baker and I, working together, propounded 
some points of order, and we 
broke that filibuster. And I disposed of 
more than 30 amendments within the 
course of a few minutes. And the filibuster 
was broken—back, neck, legs, 
arms. It went away in 12 hours. 

So I know something about filibusters. 
I helped to set a great many of 
the precedents that are in the books 
here. Dizzy Dean said you can say these 
things, you can brag, if you have done 
it. So I do not know whether one wants 
to call that bragging or not, but that is 
fact—I think it is facts I am stating. 
And I am simply stating them to let 
other Senators know that I understand 
what frustrations are. I have been over 
this road, up and down the hill. And I 
think we give away something, something 
we can never retrieve, if we give 
away the right of unlimited debate. We 
ought to forget about streamlining, 
streamlining—the Senate was not 
meant to be streamlined. The process 
here was not meant to be streamlined. 

And again I say I understand that the 
rule has been abused. I understand that 
Senators do not really very often stand 
up and debate anymore. But let us not 
try to blame it on the rules. Blame it 
on Senators. Rules should not be 
blamed for it. The rule is there. I have 
already read that rule whereby a motion 
can be made, that is nondebatable, 
to proceed. Let us not throw out the 
baby with the bath water. The minority 
can be right and the minority has 
been right and I will always take my 
stand in support of this institution, the 
Constitution, and the rights of the minority. 


And I close by reading merely 2 
pages, whereas I had intended to read 
70 pages when I began. Page 162: 

Arguments against filibusters have largely 
centered around the principle that the majority 
should rule in a democratic society. 
The very existence of the Senate, however, 
embodies an equally valid tenet in American 
democracy: the principle that minorities 
have rights. 

Of course, a minority abuses the 
rights, but the majority abuses the 
rights also—there are times. 

Furthermore, a majority of Senators, at a 
given time and on a particular issue, may 
not truly represent majority sentiment in 
the country. Senators from a few of the more 
populous States may, in fact, represent a 
majority in the Nation while numbering a 
minority of votes in the Senate, where all 
the States are equal. 

Take California, Texas, Florida, 
Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, New York— 
there is a minority of States. I have 

not counted the votes recently, but I 
would daresay there is about—almost a 
majority of the population, if not a majority. 
There is a minority of States. 
They can be right. We ought to think 
long and long and long and long and 
hard before we tinker with something 
that has been tried and tested for 200 
years because there is a problem with 
it. Let us see if we cannot heal that 
problem in other ways. Let us have resort 
to Rule VIII. Of course, we are not 
the majority again. Right now we cannot 
resort to it. But the majority can 
resort to it. 

Well, back on my reading. Let me repeat: 


Senators from a few of the more populous 
States may, in fact, represent a majority in 
the nation while numbering a minority of 
votes in the Senate, where all the States are 
equal. Additionally, a minority opinion in 
the country may become the majority view, 
once the people are more fully informed 
about an issue through lengthy debate and 
scrutiny. A minority today may become the 
majority tomorrow. 

Why should not a majority have a 
right to stop a piece of legislation? My 
friend says, well, let us retain the right 
to slow down, the right to slow down, 
but let us take away this power to stop 
something. 

I understand how Napoleon felt when 
he was banished to Elba. I have a room 
down here in the corner. Here I was 
majority leader and had this six vast 
rooms, and along came the election and 
I was banished to almost Outer Mongolia. 
I know how Napoleon felt because I 
have seen him in his picture with his 
hands folded behind him, looking out 
upon the sad and solemn sea. But that 
is the way it is in politics. You are up 
one day, you are down the next. So I 
am in the minority right now. 

Moreover, the framers of the Constitution 
thought of the Senate as the safeguard 
against hasty and unwise action by the 
House in response to temporary whims and 
storms of passion that may sweep over the 
land. Delay, deliberation, and debate 
—though time consuming—may avoid mistakes 
that would be regretted in the long 
run. The Senate is the only forum in the government 
where the perfection of laws may be 
unhurried and where controversial decisions 
may be hammered out on the anvil of 
lengthy debate. The liberties of a free people 
will always be safe where a forum exists in 
which open and unlimited debate is allowed. 

The most important argument supporting 
extended debate in the Senate, and even the 
right to filibuster, is the system of checks 
and balances. The Senate operates as the 
balance wheel in that system, because it provides 
the greatest check against an all-powerful 
executive through the privilege that 
Senators have to discuss without hindrance 
what they please for as long as they please. 
A minority can often use publicity to focus 
popular opinion upon matters that can embarrass 
the majority and the executive. 
Without the potential for filibusters, that 
power to check a Senate majority or an imperial 
presidency * * * 

We are not talking about pride and 
prerogative and privilege and power 
here. Here is what is involved. ‘‘Without 
the potential for filibusters, that 
power to check a Senate majority or an 


S 44 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

imperial presidency’’—and we have 
seen an imperial presidency in this 
land—would be destroyed.’’ 

It is a power too sacred to be trifled with. 
As Lyndon Baines Johnson said on March 9, 
1949: 

* * * if I should have the opportunity to 
send into the countries behind the iron curtain 
one freedom and only one, I know what 
my choice would be. * * * I would send to 
those nations the right of unlimited debate 
in their legislative chambers. 

Peter the Great did not have a Senate 
with unlimited debate, with power 
over the purse, when he enslaved hundreds 
of thousands of men in the building 
of Saint Petersburg. 

* * * If we now, in the haste and irritation, 
shut off this freedom, we shall be cutting off 
the most vital safeguard which minorities 
possess against the tyranny of momentary 
majorities. 

As one who has served both as majority 
leader and as minority leader, as a senator 
who has engaged both in filibustering and in 
breaking filibusters during my thirty-one 
years in this body, I believe that Rule XXII 
today strikes a fair and proper balance between 
the need to protect the minority 
against hasty and arbitrary action by a majority 
and the need for the Senate to be able 
to act on matters vital to the public interest. 
More drastic cloture than the rules now 
provide is neither necessary nor desirable. 

We must not forget that the right of extended, 
and even unlimited, debate is the 
main cornerstone of the Senate’s uniqueness. 
It is also a primary reason that the United 
States Senate is the most powerful upper 
chamber in the world today. The occasional 
abuse of this right has been, at times, a painful 
side effect, but it never has been and 
never will be fatal to the overall public good 
in the long run. Without the right of unlimited 
debate, of course, there would be no filibusters, 
but there would also be no Senate, 
as we know it. The good outweighs the bad, 
even though they may have been exasperating, 
contentious, and perceived as iniquitous. 
Filibusters are necessary evil, which must be 
tolerated lest the Senate lose its special 
strength and become a mare appendage of 
the House of Representatives. If this should 
happen, which God avert, the American Senate 
would cease to be ‘‘that remarkable 
body’’ about which William Ewart Gladstone 
spoke—‘‘the most remarkable of all the inventions 
of modern politics.’’

PETITION FOR ELECTION CONTEST 

INTRODUCTION 

Now comes Petitioner and contestant Michael 
Huffington before the Senate of the 
United States. Petitioner prays that the 
Senate deny Dianne Feinstein a seat in the 
104th Congress of the United States on the 
grounds that she has not been ‘‘duly elected’’ 
by a majority of legal ballots cast in the 
State of California in the election held on 
November 8, 1994. In the alternative, Petitioner 
asks that if the Senate seats Feinstein, 
it do so without prejudice because the 
misconduct, irregularities and fraud in the 
California election system were so widespread 
that the true results of the election 
cannot be known. Furthermore, Petitioner is 
informed and believes that additional investigation 
by the Senate before her seating becomes 
final will make clear that the serious 
systemic problems in California’s and the nation’s 
voter registration and verification system 
are so pervasive as to render the results 
of the 1994 California Senate election invalid. 

In support thereof, the petitioner alleges 
the following: 

JURISDICTION 

1. The Senate of the United States, pursuant 
to Article 1, Section 5, clause 1 of the 
Constitution of the United States, is ‘‘the 
Judge of the Elections, Returns, and Qualifications 
of its own Members’’ and has final 
jurisdiction over election contests concerning 
its Members. 
PARTIES 

2. The Petitioner and contestant, Republican 
Party candidate for the Office of United 
States Senator from the State of California 
in the November 8, 1994 general election, 
is an elector and citizen of the State of California 
and the United States and a legal 
voter in the State of California in the November 
8, 1994 general election. He is qualified 
to bring this petition, and brings this action 
as a contestant and on behalf of the almost 
4,000,000 voters of the State who cast 
legal ballots on his behalf. 
3. Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat candidate 
for the office of United States Senator 
from the State of California in the November 
8, 1994 general election, was certified as the 
winner of the election by approximately 
160,000 votes by the California Secretary of 
State on December 16, 1994, prior to numerous 
of the facts alleged herein being known. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 

4. Article I, Section 4, clause 2 of the Constitution 
of the United States grants the 
states the power to prescribe the time, 
places, and manner of holding elections for 
United States Senators and Representatives, 
subject to the congressional power to preempt 
state law on this subject. 
5. The State of California has adopted a 
comprehensive California State Elections 

S 46 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 1995 

Code which proscribes the time, place and 
manner of holding elections for the Office of 
United States Senator which was not preempted 
by federal law in this election. (CAL. 
ELEC. CODE §§1–35150) 

6. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution 
of the State of California proscribes the following 
qualifications for electors in the 
State of California: ‘‘A United States citizen 
18 years of age and resident in this state may 
vote.’’ 
7. The California Elections Code provides 
that persons who no longer reside 28 days before 
a general election in the precinct for 
which they are registered may not vote in a 
general election unless they change their 
registration address 28 days or more before 
that general election. (CAL. ELEC. CODE 
§§ 305 and 311.6) 
8. The California Elections Code provides 
that felons, deceased persons, minors, non-
citizens, non-residents and others not qualified 
to vote may neither register nor vote in 
elections in the State. (CAL. ELEC. CODE 
§§ 100, 300.5, 701 and 14216) 
9. The California Elections Code requires 
that precinct officials conducting the elections 
account for all the ballots and the signatures 
of voters who are given ballots at 
the precinct polling places on election day, 
and that these numbers be reconciled as part 
of the official count. (CAL. ELEC. CODE 
§§ 14005.5, 14006 and 14305) 
10. The California Elections Code requires 
that precinct officials conducting the elections 
require all voters to identify themselves 
when voting and to sign the register of 
voters with their name and registration address. 
(CAL. ELEC. CODE §14211) 
I. FIRST GROUNDS OF CONTEST: A GENERAL PATTERN 
OF IRREGULARITIES, FRAUD, AND OTHER 
VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS 
CODE HAS RENDERED THE RESULT OF THE 1994 
UNITED STATES SENATE ELECTION UNRELIABLE 
11. The allegations contained in Paragraphs 
1–10 are incorporated herein. 
12. A study of 84 representative sample precincts 
in California reveals a general pattern 
of voting irregularities, illegal voting, and 
other violations of the California Elections 
Code in the conduct of the November 8, 1994 
general election so widespread as to render 
the result of the United States Senate Election 
unreliable. 
13. Based upon this study, on information 
and belief, Petitioner alleges that the violations, 
irregularity and fraud are so pervasive 
in the State of California that the certification 
of the United States Senate election 
is rendered unreliable. This study shows 
that: 
a. California election workers made sufficient 
errors in counting and reconciling ballots 
in the sample precincts to render the result 
of the United States Senate election certified 
by the California Secretary of State 
unreliable. Comparing the number of ballots 
voted with the number of signatures on the 
voting rosters in the sample precincts reveals 
that election officials accepted an average 
discrepancy of one (1) vote per precinct 
in certifying the returns. This one (1) vote 
per precinct discrepancy results both from 
more ballots than signatures and more signatures 
than ballots. Projecting such discrepancies 
on a statewide basis would 
produce an error in the certification of approximately 
20,000 to 25,000 votes. 
b. The number of extra ballots certified by 
California election officials in the sample 
precincts plus the number of ballots not certified 
compared to the ballots reportedly 
sent to the Registrar of Elections from the 
sample precincts produces a discrepancy of 
1.38 ballots per precinct. If extrapolated 
statewide, these tabulation errors would 
amount to approximately 35,000 votes in the 
certification of the results. Such errors were 
more likely to occur in the heavily Democratic 
precincts of the precincts sampled. 

c. Precinct workers permitted persons who 
did not meet the statutory qualifications for 
voting in that precinct to cast ballots and allowed 
persons who did not live in the precinct 
for which they were registered to cast 
illegal ballots in substantial numbers. Comparing 
the voting roster to registration 
books used on election day shows that the 
number of voters who failed to sign the registration 
book with any residential address 
is approximately 3.5 votes per precinct. Extrapolated 
statewide, this could reveal as 
many as 85,000 improperly cast ballots, 
which are probably illegal. 
d. Comparing the voting rosters with the 
registration books used on election day 
shows that the number of voters who signed 
the roster with an address different from 
their registration address and who resided 
outside of the precinct in which they voted 
or who did not sign any address at all was 
approximately .93 votes per precinct. Extrapolated 
statewide, this could result in as 
many as 23,000 improperly cast ballots, 
which are probably illegal. These ballots are 
in addition to the 85,000 ballots reported 
above. Moreover, persons registered as 
Democrats in the precincts sampled were 
twice as likely as persons registered as Republicans 
to sign an address different than 
where they were living. 
e. Approximately seven (7) voters per precinct 
voted from an address they had listed 
as their former address on a National Change 
of Address (‘‘NCOA’’) request from the voter 
had filed. Extrapolated statewide, this would 
result in as many as 175,000 ballots being improperly 
cast. If only one-half of these voters 
had actually changed their residence but 
were allowed to vote, it would produce approximately 
88,000 improperly cast ballots. 
f. Of those who cast absentee ballots, approximately 
1.7 voters per precinct sampled 
had filed a NCOA request with the post office 
for the address from which they voted in the 
November 8, 1994 election. Extrapolated 
statewide, this would result in as many as 
43,000 improperly cast ballots. If only one-
quarter of these voters cast their ballot improperly 
it would produce 10,700 such ballots. 
14. In sum, it is alleged on information and 
belief that extrapolating the results of this 
study to the entire State of California will 
present a prima facie case that over 170,000 
votes were illegally cast in the November 8, 
1994 general election, more than Feinstein’s 
certified margin of victory and large enough 
to cast doubt upon the certification of the 
United States Senate election. 
15. The study in the sample precincts also 
suggests that if the percentage figures were 
projected for the entire state of California, 
more Democrat voters than Republican voters 
cast illegal ballots. 
16. In addition to the more than 170,000 projected 
illegal votes indicated by the study of 
sample precincts in the State of California, 
an ongoing investigation of voter fraud in 
California reveals that numerous persons not 
qualified to vote in the 1994 general election 
in California, including dead persons who 
were recorded as having voted in November, 
remained on the registration rolls and did 
vote in that election, thereby rendering the 
results of the 1994 United States Senate election 
unreliable. 
17. On November 8, 1994, precinct officials 
allowed persons who were not residing in the 
precinct from which they voted 28 days before 
the election, and therefore were not eligible 
to vote, to cast ballots in such numbers 
that the results of the 1994 California United 
States Senate election cannot be reliably 
known. 
18. On November 8, 1994, precinct officials 
and election officials allowed persons not 
qualified to vote, including, it is alleged on 
information and belief, non-citizens who 
were motivated by defeating a ballot initiative 
measure entitled ‘‘Proposition 187’’, to 
cast illegal votes in such numbers that the 
results of the 1994 California United States 
Senate election cannot be reliably known. 
19. On and before the November 8, 1994 election, 
election officials allowed persons to 
cast absentee ballots in a manner not authorized 
by law in such numbers that the result 
of the 1994 California United States Senate 
election cannot be reliably known. 
20. The irregularities, mistakes and fraud 
described in the above paragraphs are not 
isolated and are so pervasive as to constitute 
a general pattern in the conduct of the November 
8, 1994 general election that renders 
the certification of the California United 
States Senate election unreliable. 
II. SECOND GROUNDS OF CONTEST: STATE, COUNTY 
AND PRECINCT ELECTION OFFICIALS INADEQUATELY 
ADMINISTERED THE 1994 GENERAL 
ELECTION AND FAILED TO ENSURE THE SANCTITY 
OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA 
SO THAT THE RESULTS OF THE 1994 UNITED 
STATES SENATE ELECTION ARE IN DOUBT 
21. The allegations contained in Paragraphs 
1–20 are incorporated herein. 
22. The public officials charged with conducting 
the elections in the State of California 
did not enforce or satisfy the requirements 
of the California Elections Code in the 
conduct of the 1994 United States Senate 
Election so that the result of the California 
United States Senate election cannot be reliably 
known without further investigation. 
23. The Registrars of Election allowed numerous 
persons to register to vote in the 1994 
general election in California who were not 
qualified under the State’s Constitution or 
laws to be registered voters in the State in 
that election. 
24. The Registrars of Election allowed numerous 
persons to register to vote more than 
once in the November 8, 1994 general election 
in California, a violation of the California 
Elections Code. 
25. On November 8, 1994, precinct officials 
allowed to be deposited into the ballot boxes 
more ballots than there were voters who presented 
themselves for the purpose of voting 
in such numbers that the result of the 1994 
California United States Senate election 
cannot be reliably known. 
26. On November 8, 1994, precinct officials 
failed to deposit into the ballot boxes all the 
ballots that were given to voters who presented 
themselves for the purpose of voting 
and these precinct officials failed to account 
for the reason that these ballots were not deposited 
in such numbers that the result of 
the 1994 California United States Senate 
election cannot be reliably known. 
27. These irregularities in process were 
known or should have been known to the 
Secretary of State of California prior to the 
election and prior to his issuance of the certificate 
of election in the United States Senate 
election, yet he refused to investigate 
these problems or to take corrective action 
both prior to the election and during the 
canvass to insure that the certificate of election 
was reliable. 
28. The failures of the election officials 
which are complained of herein relate to duties 
which are mandatory in nature and not 
directory in nature. 
29. These irregularities in process were 
known or should have been known by the 
county Registrars since they appear on the 
original election documents containing the 
totals certified to the Secretary of State 
during the canvass period. Notwithstanding 
this fact, the Registrars failed to resolve the 

January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S 47 

discrepancies that appeared on the documents 
sent to them by the precinct officials. 

30. Because of these irregularities and discrepancies, 
the Secretary of State’s certificate 
of election is unreliable and the margin 
between the two major party candidates is 
less than the number of unaccounted for ballots 
and illegal ballots cast in the November 
8, 1994 election. 
31. The total number of illegal ballots cast 
or ballots unaccounted for and the insufficiency 
of ballots in some precincts and excess 
of ballots in other precincts is sufficiently 
large throughout the State of California 
to cast doubt on the election certificate 
issued by the Secretary of State and to 
cast doubt on which of the two major party 
candidates won the election for the United 
States Senate. 
32. These failures of the election officials 
cannot be remedied by a recount of the votes 
or the remedies available in the California 
Elections Code for an election contest. 
33. Because California lacks any reliable 
verification system in its registration process 
to determine the identity and eligibility 
of voters, the failure of election officials to 
enforce the statutory requirements makes 
unreliable the certificate of election in close 
contests, such as the contest at issue here. 
34. The general pattern of irregularities in 
the election process and illegal ballots cast 
is so pervasive that the results of the 1994 
United States Senate election are in doubt 
and, upon information and belief, it is alleged 
that if the illegal ballots cast could be 
removed from the certificate so issued, the 
result of the election would be changed. 
III. THIRD GROUNDS OF CONTEST: THE IRREGULARITIES 
AND ERRORS COMPLAINED OF CONSTITUTE 
A VIOLATION OF THE 14TH AMENDMENT 
35. The allegations contained in paragraphs 
1–34 are incorporated herein. 
36. The failure of California to provide a reliable 
election system whereby only legal 
voters are allowed to cast ballots and illegal 
ballots are not counted and to administer 
the 1994 Senate election according to its own 
Constitution and Elections Code constitutes 
a denial of 14th Amendment protections to 
the legal voters of California in that such 
failure structurally dilutes the valid votes 
cast for both candidates for United States 
Senator in 1994. 
IV. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
That based upon the foregoing, the Petitioner 
and Contestant prays: 

1. That on the day of covering, the Secretary 
of the Senate be instructed to not accept 
the certification from the State of California 
for the 1994 United States Senate election. 
2. That, in the alternative, Dianne Feinstein 
be seated without prejudice to the 
rights of the Senate to revoke her seating by 
majority vote after full investigation of the 
conduct of the election. 
3. That the matter be referred to the Rules 
and Administration Committee with instructions 
to investigate immediately the allegations 
set forth above in order to advise the 
Senate on the action to take in this matter. 
4. That upon finding the facts to be substantially 
as set forth in the petition or upon 
receipt of additional evidence, to declare the 
Senate seat in question be vacant and request 
that the State of California conduct a 
new election, or in the alternative, to declare 
the person who received the highest 
number of legal votes duly elected if such 
numbers of legal votes can be determined. 
5. That the Senate grant such additional 
relief that the Senate deems warranted by 
the facts.

EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS 

REFORM IMMIGRATION LAWS 

HON. BOB STUMP 

OF ARIZONA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. STUMP. Mr. Speaker, today, this first 
day of the 104th Congress, I am introducing a 
package of three immigration reform bills that 
deserve top priority as the new Congress 
works to make America a better place to live. 

As I am sure many of my colleagues in this 
body experienced on the campaign trail last 
year, Americans are deeply concerned about 
immigration and its impact on their lives. They 
are anxious about the changing face of this 
country and the problems associated with our 
system of immigration. I don’t blame them. On 
any given day, there are countless news reports 
about the destructive consequences of 
our dysfunctional immigration policies. But one 
need not rely on the media for an understanding 
of this issue, as more and more 
Americans are getting firsthand knowledge of 
the ill-effects of out-of-control immigration. 

At the forefront of the immigration debate is 
illegal immigration. After all, many States, including 
my State of Arizona, have been hard-
pressed to find the resources required to deal 
with this growing problem. They have had to 
resort to filing suit against the Federal Government 
for reimbursement. And, let us not forget 
what took place in California last November. 
Through the passage of proposition 187, Californians 
overwhelmingly conveyed a message 
that they will no longer be the victims in the 
illegal immigration crisis. It is just a matter of 
time before other States follow California’s 
lead. 

These actions prove that the Congress has 
been negligent in its duty to put forth an immigration 
policy that is fair and responsible and 
in the best interests of the States and the 
American people. Through congressional inaction 
we have sent a message to other countries 
that our borders are insecure, that we 
don’t have an interest in enforcing our laws, 
and that we have a never ending supply of 
public assistance benefits. 

We must act now to correct this perception. 
That is why I am introducing the Immigration 
Accountability Act of 1995. This bill goes to 
the heart of the illegal immigration crisis by 
prohibiting the payment of Federal benefits to 
illegals and ending the practice of conferring 
citizenship on the children of illegal aliens. In 
addition, the bill would strengthen our often-
abused asylum system by providing for the expeditious 
processing of meritorious claims and 
the prompt exclusion of those who attempt to 
defraud the system. Finally, the bill calls for a 
significant increase in the border patrol. By increasing 
our border security and eliminating 
these compelling illegal immigration incentives, 
I believe we can turn the tide of illegal immigration. 


Illegal immigration is a serious problem and 
I am delighted that many Members of the new 
Congress have expressed their willingness to 

confront it. However, there is another problem 
that is more complex, and just as pressing. I 
am referring to legal immigration. We are currently 
experiencing unprecedented levels of 
legal immigrants, perhaps 15 million in the 
1990’s. Through ill-conceived immigration 
laws, we are accommodating people in other 
countries who wish to live here with little regard 
for those already here, citizens and immigrants 
alike. 

Mr. Speaker, it is time to take a break, a 
temporary pause, from the uncontrolled immigration 
that has resulted in overcrowded 
schools and hospitals, scarce employment, inadequate 
housing, and a deteriorating standard 
of living. I am proposing, through the Immigration 
Moratorium Act of 1995, that we limit 
immigration to the spouses and minor children 
of U.S. citizens, legitimate refugees, and those 
immigrants who have been waiting in the immigration 
backlog for more than 10 years. This 
would bring our immigration numbers in line 
with the traditional U.S. average of about 
297,000 per year. 

I am convinced that my moratorium bill 
would yield highly positive results. A moratorium 
would allow us to begin absorbing and 
assimilating the millions of newcomers who 
have settled here in recent years and also 
give us an opportunity to revamp our misguided 
and outdated policies to suit the realities 
of today’s America. Furthermore, an additional 
benefit of a moratorium is that it would 
free up manpower and resources to deal with 
illegal immigration. 

I realize that some of my colleagues believe 
it to be politically unpopular to advocate a reduction 
in legal immigration. However, I would 
like to point out that as immigration levels 
have risen, so has public opinion turned 
against increased immigration. A CNN/USA 
Today poll found that 76 percent of Americans 
feel immigration should be stopped or reduced 
until the economy improves. And, all opinion 
surveys show that the sentiment to restore a 
more modest immigration flow is about as 
strong among noncitizens as among citizens, 
and among nonwhite Americans as among 
white Americans. I encourage the Members of 
this body to give these statistics serious consideration 
before abandoning the idea of reducing 
legal immigration. 

The last bill of my immigration reform package, 
the Immigrant Financial Responsibility 
and Sponsorship Act of 1995, is directed at 
rapidly growing immigrant welfare use. The 
percentage of immigrants below the poverty 
line is 50 percent higher than that of natives. 
Even more astonishing is that the estimated 
1993 public assistance and services costs for 
immigrants was $10.42 billion. At a time when 
we are searching for ways to reform the welfare 
system in this country it would be foolish 
to let this costly trend continue. 

Under my bill, aliens would be required to 
demonstrate that they are unlikely to become 
a public charge. If they cannot do so, they will 
not be admitted to the United States unless a 
suitable sponsor gives a proper bond and 
guarantees financial responsibility for the 

alien. This is a reliable and fair way to ensure 
that those immigrants who wish to come to 
this country will not wind up on our already-
overburdened welfare rolls. 

Mr. Speaker, as Members of the U.S. Congress, 
we have an obligation to the American 
people to restore a sense of fairness and responsibility 
to our immigration laws. I believe 
that my bills take a significant step toward fulfilling 
that obligation. I urge my colleagues to 
join me.

REPEAL OF SECTION 903 

HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR. 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, the United 
States taxes the income of its citizens and 
corporations whether it is earned at home or 
abroad. The U.S. foreign tax credit provides 
relief to U.S. taxpayers from the double-taxation 
so they will not determine where a company 
invests. Nevertheless, when Congress 
adopted the section 903 of the Internal Revenue 
Code, an unfair tax advantage was given 
to companies that invest abroad. For that reason, 
I have introduced legislation to repeal 
section 903. 

Mr. Speaker, section 903 extends credibility 
to those foreign taxes imposed in lieu of foreign 
income taxes. This means that all foreign 
taxes such as foreign sales, excise, and value 
added taxes are creditable as business costs 
towards their foreign taxes paid. There is no 
constraint on the type of foreign tax that can 
be credited. This leaves domestic U.S. companies 
at a distinct disadvantage. They are only 
able to deduct taxes that are in lieu of income 
taxes. 

Mr. Speaker, section 903 was enacted in 
1942 when certain countries taxed companies 
on a different basis from our concept of net income. 
These countries were less sophisticated 
and imposed taxes on a gross income basis, 
while the United States concept of net income 
had become quite refined. In order to make up 
for the difference, Congress extended credit to 
all foreign taxes. Since 1942, however, foreign 
tax systems have become quite sophisticated. 
Thus, the scope of section 903 has been expanded 
to include a credit for taxes paid to 
foreign countries in lieu of foreign income tax. 

Mr. Speaker, creditable foreign taxes must 
be limited to income taxes and taxes of similar 
nature. This is because under present law indirect 
taxes and other taxes in lieu of taxes 
can be shifted onto either consumers or labor. 
A tax is shifted when a corporation is able to 
maintain its profits at their pre-tax level despite 
paying an income tax by raising prices. Therefore, 
these companies are receiving relief from 
a tax burden in the form of tax credits that 
they do not bear. The consumers and workers 
incur part of the burden of the tax. 

Mr. Speaker, the foreign tax credit should 
be designed to provide relief from double-taxation 
and to make sure that tax incentives do

not exist. Taxes in lieu of should instead be 
deductible to relieve only the portion of the tax 
borne by the taxpayer. Until section 903 is repealed, 
more countries may adjust their tax 
laws in order to take advantage of section 

903. In my district, thousands of jobs have 
been lost when companies moved their operations 
overseas. It is appalling to think that our 
tax system gave them incentives to do so. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to cosponsor 
this important piece of legislation.

GATT 

HON. LEE H. HAMILTON 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
insert my Washington Report for Wednesday, 
December 14, 1994 into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. 

GATT 
Congress recently approved one of the 
most important—and controversial—measures 
of 1994: the latest expansion of the 47-
year old General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade [GATT]. It is the most ambitious 
trade agreement in history. 
The agreement among 124 nations, negotiated 
over seven years, will lower tariffs 
(import taxes) by one third, reduce international 
subsidies for farm exports, 
strengthen protections for patents and inventions, 
and take steps toward regulating 
trade in services and investment. Congress 
held dozens of hearings on the negotiations 
and passed numerous measures to guide the 
Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations 
in their pursuit of U.S. trade interests. Last 
week both the House and the Senate passed 
GATT by overwhelming margins. Dozens of 
Indiana manufacturers and farm groups 
urged passage of GATT, while many other 
Hoosiers expressed concern about protecting 

U.S. interests. The intense debate on GATT 
focused on three main issues: the impact of 
GATT on American jobs, on the budget deficit, 
and on U.S. sovereignty. 
JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH 

Many people have expressed concern about 
the impact of GATT on U.S. jobs, yet the 
case for job growth under GATT is strong. 
GATT commits 124 countries to reduce tariff 
taxes for agriculture, services, and manufactured 
goods, with the global savings totaling 
$744 billion over ten years. Since the U.S. 
economy is already one of the fairest and 
most open in the world, other countries will 
be reducing their tariffs and restrictions 
much more than we will. The U.S. should be 
the biggest winner under the expanded 
GATT, and the agreement should give our 
economy a boost. 

Lower trade barriers and tariffs will save 

U.S. consumers money and also create jobs 
through more exports and new investment. 
The Council of Economic Advisors estimates 
that within a decade GATT will boost U.S. 
economic output by $100–200 billion a year. 
GATT should directly benefit many Hoosier 
workers. Indiana manufacturers will see a 
33% reduction in tariffs on their products. 
Distillers will benefit from lower tariffs on 
U.S. spirits, and copyright protections will 
outlaw counterfeit foreign products. According 
to the Indiana Farm Bureau, Hoosier 
farmers can expect an additional $1.05 billion 
in income from GATT over ten years. Overall, 
GATT could add $1,700 to the annual income 
of the average U.S. family within a 
decade. 
BUDGET CONCERNS 

Because the U.S. has agreed to reduce its 
tariffs by an average of 1.6%, certain federal 
revenues will decrease. The Congressional 
Budget Office estimates this loss will be $11.9 
billion over the next five years. To offset it, 
the package approved by Congress cuts 
spending in a number of programs, charges 
fees for certain customs services and broadcast 
licenses, and closes some tax loopholes. 

More importantly, GATT’s impact on the 
economy—new jobs and more exports— 
should create new federal income tax revenue 
that greatly exceeds any reduction in 
tariff revenue. GATT-related economic activity 
is estimated to reduce the federal deficit 
by some $60 billion over the next ten 
years. GATT is fiscally responsible. 

WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION 

At the direction of Congress in 1988, U.S. 
negotiators sought a stronger enforcement 
mechanism against unfair trade practices. 
Under the new agreement, the World Trade 
Organization [WTO] would replace the informal 
negotiating group that has existed for 
almost fifty years. In the past, a country 
with unfair trade practices could refuse to 
obey a ruling and not lose benefits. Now, unfair 
traders have to obey the rulings or face 
still consequences. 

The WTO would issue rulings on trade disputes 
concerning goods, services, and intellectual 
property. For example, Canada could 
file a complaint against Japan for unfairly 
restricting Canadian wheat imports. If the 
WTO agreed with Canada, and Japan refused 
to change its practices, Japan would have to 
pay compensation or be subject to Canadian 
trade penalties. 

SOVEREIGNTY 

Many Hoosiers believe that any international 
trade council should not infringe on 

U.S. sovereignty. I strongly agree, and I 
worked hard to include strict safeguards in 
the package to protect our sovereignty. 
First, GATT will continue to make nearly 
all decisions by consensus—there has not 
been a vote in more than thirty years. Second, 
the WTO cannot change any U.S. laws 
or policies. Only Congress and the President 
can do that, and no WTO ruling has any 
standing in U.S. courts. Third, we can withdraw 
from the WTO at any time or pass legislation 
overriding any part of GATT. With 
my support, Congress and the President also 
agreed to create a special U.S. panel to review 
WTO decisions. If this panel identifies 
three unfavorable WTO rulings, any Member 
of Congress can demand an immediate vote 
on withdrawing from the WTO. Finally, the 
United States has the world’s largest market 
and most powerful economy. Other countries 
are not likely to impose trade sanctions in 
WTO disputes for fear of getting into a trade 
war with the U.S. 

CONSEQUENCES OF REJECTION 

Failure by the U.S. to ratify the agreement 
would have meant an enormous missed opportunity 
and an abdication of our international 
leadership. The U.S. dominated the 
negotiations: how could other countries have 
confidence in us if we failed to approve an 
agreement so beneficial to our interests? 
Without this agreement, countries would 
erect new trade barriers, and protectionism 
would rise. All of our economies would suffer. 
Democratic reforms would slow, shaky 
financial markets could boost interest rates, 
and world stability—so closely tied to economic 
cooperation—could be undermined. 

Of course, GATT is not perfect. As a trade 
agreement it does not directly address important 
concerns such as child labor or political 
freedom, but GATT does increase the incentives 
for other countries to cooperate 
with us on these issues. Overall compliance 

of other countries with GATT will have to be 
closely monitored. 

CONCLUSION 

GATT should mean more secure, high-paying 
jobs for Hoosiers and a better standard of 
living. The U.S. cannot afford to pass up the 
economic benefits of GATT. The WTO should 
be a strong advocate for U.S. interests while 
protecting our sovereignty, and free and fair 
trade will continue to promote peace and 
prosperity around the globe.

INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION 
TO AMEND THE ALASKA NATIVE 
CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 
1971 

HON. DON YOUNG 

OF ALASKA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to introduce a bill to amend the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 at 
the request of Cook Inlet Region, Inc. [CIRI]. 

Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act [ANCSA] in 1971 to address 
claims to lands in Alaska by its Eskimo, Indian, 
and Aleut native people. Lands and 
other benefits transferred to Alaska Natives 
under the act were conveyed to corporations 
formed under the act. Alaska Natives enrolled 
to these corporations were issued shares in 
the corporation. CIRI is one of the corporations 
formed under ANCSA and has approximately 
6,262 Alaska Natives enrolled, each of 
whom were issued 100 shares of stock in 
CIRI, as required under ANCSA. 

ANCSA stock, unlike most corporate stock, 
cannot be sold, transferred, or pledged by the 
owners of the shares. Rather, transfers can 
only happen through inheritance, or in limited 
case, by court decree. The ANCSA provisions 
restricting the sale of stock were put in place 
to protect Native shareholders from knowledgeable 
or unscrupulous transactions, and to 
allow the corporation to grow and mature in 
order to provide long-lasting benefits to its 
shareholder. 

The drafters of ANCSA initially believed that 
a period of 20 years would be a sufficient 
amount of time for the restrictions on sale to 
remain in place. Therefore, the restrictions 
were to expire 20 years after passage of 
ANCSA on December 31, 1991. 

As 1991 approached, bringing with it the impending 
change in the alienability of Native 
stock, the Alaska Native community grew concerned 
about the effect of the potential sale of 
Native stock. The Alaska Federation of Natives, 
a statewide organization representing 
the State’s 90,000 natives, spearheaded a legislative 
initiative to address the 1991 stock 
sale issue. Many of the Native corporations, 
including CIRI, actively solicited their shareholders’ 
view on this critical matter, through 
meetings, questionnaires, polling, and formal 
votes. In 1987, 3 years prior to the 1991 re-
striction-lifting date, Congress enacted legislation 
which reformed the mechanism governing 
stock sale restrictions in a fundamental way 
under the 1987 amendments, instead of expiring 
automatically in 1991, the restrictions on 
alienability continue automatically unless and 
until the shareholders of a Native corporation 
vote to remove them. The 1987 amendments 
provide several procedural mechanisms to 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E3 

bring such a vote, including action by the 
board of directors and petitions by shareholder. 


To date, no Native corporation has sought 
to life the alienability restrictions. Fundamentally, 
this is because Native shareholders continue 
to value Native ownership of the corporations 
and Native control of the lands and 
other assets held by them. 

CIRI has conducted a number of continuing 
surveys, focus groups, and special shareholder 
meetings to ascertain the views of its 
shareholders regarding the alienation restrictions 
on CIRI stock. Two results have consistently 
stood out in these assessments. 

First, the majority of CIRI shareholders favor 
maintaining Native ownership and control of 
CIRI. These shareholders, whose numbers 
consistently register at the 70 to 80 percent 
level, see economic benefits in the continuation 
of Native ownership, and also value the 
important cultural goals, values and activities 
of their ANCSA corporation. 

Second, a significant percentage, albeit a 
minority of shareholders, favor assessing 
some, or all, of the value of their CIRI stock 
through the sale of that stock. These shareholders 
include, but, are not limited to elderly 
shareholders who have real current needs, yet 
doubt that sale of stock will be available to 
them in their lifetime: holders of small, fractional 
shares received through one or more 
cycles of inheritance; non-Natives who have 
acquired stock through inheritance but without 
attendant voting privileges; and shareholders 
who have few ties to the corporation or to 
Alaska, 25 percent of CIRI shareholders live 
outside of Alaska. 

Under current law, these two legitimate but 
conflicting concerns cannot be addressed, because 
lifting restrictions on the sale of stock is 
an all or nothing proposition. In order to allow 
the minority of shareholders to exercise their 
desire to sell some or all of their stock, the 
majority of shareholders would have to sacrifice 
their important desire to maintain Native 
control and ownership to CIRI. 

CIRI believes this conflict will eventually 
leave the interests of the majority of its shareholders 
vulnerable to political instability. In addition, 
CIRI recognizes that responding to the 
desire of those shareholders who wish to sell 
CIRI stock is a legitimate corporate responsibility. 
More importantly, CIRI believes that 
there is a way to address the needs and desires 
of both groups of shareholders, those 
who wish to sell stock and those who desire 
to maintain Native ownership of CIRI, so that 
the sale of stock will not compromise the ‘‘nativeness’’ 
of the company, and will not jeopardize 
the economic future of the company for 
those who choose not to sell. The method embodied 
in this legislation is one that other companies 
routinely use: the buying back of its 
own stock. The newly acquired stock would 
then be canceled. 

Mr. Speaker, I have discussed this bill at 
length with CIRI and I am convinced this is the 
best and only option available for their shareholders 
to voluntarily sell their stock back to 
CIRI. It is identical to that which passed the

INTRODUCTION OF HEALTH INSUR


ANCE DEDUCTION FOR SELF-EM


PLOYED BUSINESS OWNERS 

HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 

OF MASSACHUSETTS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, 
prior to December 1993, self-employed business 
owners were allowed to deduct 25 percent 
of the cost of their health insurance and 
this deduction has expired. I am introducing 
legislation that will make the cost of health insurance 
deductible for self-employed business 
owners. 

The purpose of this legislation is to restore 
and to make permanent the 25 percent deduction 
and to gradually increase the deduction to 
100 percent. The bill phases in the 100 percent 
deduction over a period of 4 years. For 
calendar years 1994 and 1995, health insurance 
would be 25 percent deductible; in 1996 
and 1997 it would become 50 percent deductible; 
and in 1996 and thereafter health insurance 
would become 100 percent deductible. 
Increasing the deduction to 100 percent would 
provide small businesses with an incentive to 
provide expanded health insurance coverage. 
Also, corporations are permitted to deduct 100 
percent of the cost of providing health care insurance. 


One of the major problems facing small 
businesses is the high cost of health insurance. 
Increasing the deduction would allow 
business owners to spend more on health 
care. This legislation provides businesses with 
an incentive to purchase health care insurance. 


Congress can immediately begin to reduce 
the cost of health care coverage by extending 
the 25-percent deduction for self-employed individuals’ 
health insurance. The high cost of 
health care insurance is one of the impediments 
to health care access. I urge you to 
support this legislation.

CAMINO REAL CORRIDOR AND 
COMMISSION 

HON. RONALD D. COLEMAN 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
re-introduce legislation to create the Camino 
Real Corridor and Commission. I introduced 
this bill during the previous session, and I continue 
to believe that the passage of this legislation 
is indispensable to the goals of facilitating 
national trade and growth in the coming 
years. 

While the passage of the North American 
Free-Trade Agreement will no doubt affect the 
entire Nation, perhaps no area will witness 
greater changes than the Southwestern region 
along the Mexican border. Not only will the 
area continue to experience the benefits of increasing 
international economic integration, 
but it will also be profoundly impacted by the 
large influx of traffic that is the necessary byproduct 
of expanding trade. The district which 
I represent, El Paso, TX, has an infrastructure 
system that will be among the hardest hit by 
the increasing levels of commerce between 
the United States and Mexico. 

El Paso is one of the most important border 
crossings in the world. Over $12 billion in 
trade passes over the El Paso-Ciudad Juarez, 
Chihuahua border each year; 18 percent of 
United States exports to and 25 percent of 
United States imports from Mexico pass 
through this trans-border metropolitan region. 
Furthermore, it is the busiest point of entry for 
commercial trucks. In light of the fact that the 
trade volume transported through this port of 
entry is projected to nearly double by the year 
2000, and that the population of the El Paso 
area is one of the fastest-growing in the Nation, 
the highways and border infrastructure of 
this area warrant our particular attention. 

But we must bear in mind that El Paso is 
only one point on a trade route that extends 
from the Mexican State of Chihuahua into the 
interior portion of the United States. A natural 
trade corridor is emerging from the Mexican 
border State of Chihuahua to Denver through 
El Paso and New Mexico. The Mexican Government 
has already demonstrated its commitment 
to the region, with the construction of a 
new highway system that extends to the State 
of Chihuahua through several of Mexico’s largest 
cities in the industrialized north—a highway 
over 600 miles long. On the U.S. side, 
the emerging corridor bears great resemblance 
to the highway systems designated by 
section 1105c of the 1991 Intermodal Surface 
Transportation Efficiency Act as ‘‘corridors of 
national significance’’. Like those highway systems, 
the highway system from El Paso to 
Denver has undergone a great increase in 
use, particularly in the form of commercial traffic, 
since the designation of the Federal Interstate 
System. This trend will be amplified in 
the next decade, as trade and population 
growth continue to soar in the region. 

Therefore, today I am re-introducing legislation 
to create the Camino Real Corridor. As I 
noted previously, the historical reference herein 
recognizes the importance of this trade 
route to the development of the Southwest. 
The Camino Real de la Tierra Adentro, the 
Royal Highway of the Interior Lands, was the 
route traveled by people from Mexico City to 
Santa Fe. The modern corridor would be 
achieved through the enhancement of the 
trade route that today connects El Paso to Albuquerque 
to Denver, and of the border arterials 
that feed into this route. The improvements 
in infrastructure along this route would 
include the use of intelligence vehicle highway 
systems where appropriate. Thus, information, 
communications, and control technologies will 
be applied to improve the efficiency of this 
surface transportation system. These changes 
would guarantee that the roads which carry 
goods between Mexico and the interior portions 
of the United States could handle the 
heavy flow of traffic that is anticipated in the 
upcoming decades. Further, Denver is at the 
crossroads to the West and Midwest, and positioned 
to develop north to Canada. 

Unfortunately, good roads alone cannot 
guarantee the efficient cross-border passage 
of people, goods, and capital. Indeed, many of 
the current delays in United States-Mexico 
trade occur at the border. So to ensure the 
smooth operation of the corridor system, I 
have also proposed the creation of the Camino 
Real Corridor Commission. This Commission 
would report to the Secretary of 
Transportation, and would be responsible for 
making recommendations to maximize effective 
utilization of the highways and border 


E4 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 1995 

crossings of the corridor. It would also ensure 
the development of more efficient trade routes. 
One year after its formation, this Commission 
would make recommendations to the Secretary 
of Transportation indicating the most 
desirable routes for East-West expansion of 
the corridor, and for possible expansion of the 
corridor to the Canadian border. 

We should not wait until our borders and 
our trade routes are completely overwhelmed 
to take decisive action. Rather, our infrastructure 
and our border enforcement agencies 
should keep pace with growing trade levels, 
and with the realities of increasing international 
interdependence. 

The Camino Real Corridor is clearly the 
best place to start, but it need not be an end 
point. This project ought to serve as a model 
for future initiatives in other major border cities. 
It will also serve as a starting point for an 
important highway network that will connect 
Mexico with the interior United States, and 
possibly with Canada. 

I recognize that we are operating in a political 
climate where it is more popular to criticize 
than to create, and much easier to 
deconstruct than to construct. But it is important 
to recognize that one of the fundamental 
roles of the Federal Government has always 
been the funding and oversight of interstate 
projects that are central to national growth and 
prosperity. The creation of the Camino Real 
Corridor is such a project, and consequently, 
it deserves support.

REPEAL THE ‘‘MOTOR VOTER’’ 
BILL 

HON. BOB STUMP 

OF ARIZONA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. STUMP. Mr. Speaker, on May 10, 1993, 
President Clinton signed into law a $200 million 
unfunded Federal mandate called ‘‘The 
National Voter Registration Act of 1993.’’ I am 
today introducing a bill to repeal it. 

This law, commonly referred to as the 
‘‘motor voter’’ bill, tramples on States rights by 
requiring them to implement a law that allows 
people to register to vote by mail, or when 
they apply for a driver’s license, or welfare. 
Proponents of the measure argued that this 
was the answer to voter apathy. They reasoned 
that by making voter registration easier, 
voter turnout would increase. However, there 
is little, if any, evidence to validate this contention. 
In fact, over the past three decades, 
voter registration requirements have grown 
easier and easier, yet voter turnout has actually 
decreased over the same time period. 

Moreover, by easing registration requirements, 
and not providing the States with the 
funds necessary to keep their registration lists 
up-to-date and clean, the motor voter bill will 
most likely increase election fraud. 

Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Congress should not 
be legislating in this area. The States know 
best how to develop voter registration programs 
in their own jurisdictions with the least 
cost and chance of fraud and abuse. It is 
senseless to undermine their voter registration 
programs by requiring them to comply with a 
nationalized costly mandate. 

Our new congressional leaders have 
pledged to make it tougher for the Federal 

Government to place unfunded Federal mandates 
on the States. The bill I am proposing 
today is in step with the pledge, and I urge my 
colleagues to support it.

NATIONAL FIREARMS POLICY 
COMMISSION ACT 

HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR. 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, during the 
103d Congress, I introduced H.R. 4423, the 
‘‘National Firearms Policy Commission Act,’’ 
legislation that will bring the President, Members 
of Congress, Justices of the Supreme 
Court, gun ownership advocacy groups, law 
enforcement groups, and private citizens together 
to exchange their views on Federal firearms 
policy so that a consensus on Federal 
policy can be reached. I rise today to reintroduce 
this legislation, and I invite all of my colleagues 
to become cosponsors of this important 
bill. 

In the 103d session alone, Congress 
passed two of the most sweeping firearms policy 
bills in the history of this country: the Brady 
bill and the assault weapons ban. From the introduction 
of those bills to the final vote, America 
came to see just how large the gap between 
both sides of the gun control debate is. 
And yet despite all the debate on these two 
pivotal pieces of legislation, it has become 
even clearer that each side’s views are only 
being further entrenched, not altered through 
pragmatic discussion that will ensure that each 
side is heard. My bill will promote that type of 
pragmatic discussion. 

Specifically, this legislation will establish a 
39-member Commission, which will include 
the following parties: the U.S. Attorney General, 
five Members of the House, five Senators, 
three Supreme Court Justices, five private 
citizens appointed by the President, five 
private citizens appointed by the Senate, five 
private citizens appointed by the House, five 
members representing gun ownership advocacy 
groups, and five representatives from law 
enforcement. The chairman of the Commission 
will have 6 months to transmit its recommendations 
to the President and Congress. 
Aside from travel expenses, members of the 
Commission will serve without pay. The Commission 
will, however, be authorized to hire 
and pay its own staff and staff from other Federal 
agencies. 

For the past 10 years, Congress has been 
caught in the middle of a tug of war between 
law enforcement and the NRA. As a result, 
Congress has been unable to develop a real 
consensus on how to address violent crime 
and firearms policy. The goal of the Commission 
I have proposed is to forge a consensus 
on these issues and present to Congress and 
the President a list of legislative initiatives that 
can be adopted with bipartisan support. 

Let us bring rational dialogue to Federal firearms 
policy. Please cosponsor this important 
legislative initiative. 

TRADE AND JOB SECURITY 

HON. LEE H. HAMILTON 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
insert my Washington Report for Wednesday, 
December 21, 1994 into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. 

TRADE AND JOB SECURITY 
America’s middle-class workers are increasingly 
frustrated and concerned about 
their economic future. They are working 
harder and longer than ever but their income 
is just not growing. Many are concerned 
about their job security and worry that their 
job could be the next to be eliminated. One 
third of those recently polled said they are 
worse off than they expected to be at this 
age, and close to two thirds said they do not 
expect their children to do as well as they 
have done. Too many individuals believe the 
American dream is simply beyond their 
reach. 
It used to be that if workers were conscientious 
and performed their jobs well they 
could expect to advance and prosper in the 
years ahead. Today, however, many workers—
both blue collar and white collar—face 
an uncertain future. They may encounter 
foreign competition, corporate downsizing, 
automation, or the increased use of computers. 
In a recent survey, three out of four 
employers said that their own employees 
fear losing their jobs. As the Secretary of 
Labor puts it, the middle class has become 
the anxious class. 

EXPANDING TRADE 

One of their biggest concerns is foreign 
competition created by the dynamic global 
marketplace. Congress and all recent Presidents 
have taken steps to expand U.S. trade 
opportunities. Since the late 1970s, several 
bilateral and multilateral agreements have 
been approved, including the Tokyo Round 
expansion of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade 
Agreement, the North America Free Trade 
Agreement, and the new GATT agreements 
that create, among other things, the World 
Trade Organization. Next might be free trade 
agreements with Chile and other countries in 
the Western Hemisphere. 

On balance, I think expanded trade is a 
plus for American workers. Trade now accounts 
for a large share of U.S. economic 
growth, and it means expanded sales for U.S. 
businesses. The recently approved expansion 
of GATT, for example, will provide stable 
rules for trade and remove restrictions that 
limit sales of our goods and services abroad. 
The Council of Economic Advisors estimates 
that GATT will boost U.S. economic output 
$100–200 billion within ten years. 

At the same time I recognize that expanded 
trade is a threat to some U.S. workers. 
Trade may generate more U.S. jobs than 
it eliminates, but it does put some Americans 
out of work. While the President talks 
about the millions of good paying jobs created 
by free trade, many middle-class workers 
believe the benefits of trade go to a few 
talented, well-educated professionals and executives 
while they fall behind. 

STEPS NEEDED 

The remedy is not to simply close our markets 
to trade. We are one of the most competitive 
countries in the world and many 

U.S. jobs are already tied to exports and 
trade. But we do need to take several steps 
to improve our ability to deal with this 
changing environment and reduce job insecurity 
for many Americans. 

January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E5 

First, we must continue to reduce the federal 
budget deficit. Keeping the deficit down 
means less borrowing by the government, 
thus freeing up funds at lower interest rates 
for businesses to invest. That should boost 
the economy and spur job creation. We need 
to make sure that the U.S. economy continues 
to generate more jobs than are lost to 
foreign competition. 

Second, we must reassess the more than 
150 federal job training and retraining programs 
to see which ones work and which 
ones don’t. Some should be expanded, others 
simply dropped. We should accelerate our efforts 
to create ‘‘reemployment centers’’ and 
put more of the resources into the hands of 
ordinary Americans rather than government 
agencies, so people can get the skills they 
need in a way that makes sense for them. We 
need a better safety net for individuals and 
communities experiencing the downside of 
open trade. 

Third, we must encourage companies to 
spend more of their profits to continually 
upgrade the skills of their workers and to retrain 
workers whose jobs have been lost 
through trade or technology. U.S. firms generally 
invest less in worker training than 
firms abroad, and what they do invest is 
more heavily concentrated on professional 
and managerial workers. Skilled workers 
and important assets, and businesses need to 
invest more in their development. 

Fourth, federal policies should help important 
industries threatened by foreign competition. 
Federal research and development 
grants, tax policy, and deregulation all can 
help strengthen important U.S. industries 
and make them more competitive in the 
global market. We also need to expand the 
federal manufacturing extension program, 
which helps small companies adopt the latest 
production techniques. 

Fifth, we must not allow other countries to 
use the open markets provided by the trade 
agreements to unfairly harm our industries. 
We must vigorously prosecute dumping and 
other unfair trade practices. If a surge of imports 
is displacing our workers, GATT allows 
us to take steps to limit those imports. At 
the same time, we must vigorously pursue 
our rights in cases where foreign practices 
restrict our exports. We must make sure 
that trade agreements mean a level playing 
field that promotes U.S. exports. 

Finally, we must have accurate data about 
the impact of more open trade on U.S. jobs. 
Many economists believe that government 
trade statistics underestimate U.S. exports 
by some 10%, for a variety of technical reasons. 
If so, estimates of jobs created by exports 
are also underestimated. We also need 
better data on identifying industries hurt by 
imports. 

CONCLUSION 

Overall, we must pursue policies which 
promote economic growth, help strengthen 

U.S. companies, continually upgrade the 
skills of our workers, and find new markets 
for our products abroad. Our number one priority 
is jobs—good and secure jobs. Our challenge 
is to promote broad participation by 
our workforce in this changing environment 
so that anxious workers can become assured, 
productive, capable Americans. Improving 
Americans’ job security must be among our 
highest priorities in the upcoming session of 
Congress. 
INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION 
CONCERNING ALASKA NATIVE 
CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 
1971 

HON. DON YOUNG 

OF ALASKA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to introduce a bill to amend the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 at 
the request of the Alaska Federation of Natives. 
This bill is the result of the work of the 
Legislative Council of the Alaska Federation of 
Natives to correct existing technical problems 
with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 
[ANCSA] and the Alaska National Interest 
Lands Conservation Act [ANILCA]. I am introducing 
an identical version of that which 
passed the House during the 103d Congress. 
It is my intention to move this bill early this 
year based on agreements reached last year. 

This bill makes a number of technical 
changes to ANCSA and ANILCA. It also 
makes a number of substantive additions 
which address issues not anticipated at the 
time of passage of ANCSA. Because of Alaska’s 
relative youth as a State of the Union and 
the unprecedented amount of Alaska-specific 
Federal legislation passed since statehood, it 
is imperative that we respond to occasional 
oversights and/or quirks in the overlapping 
laws to ensure that unintended consequences 
do not occur. This effort is designed to rectify 
such instances. 

The legislation is designed to resolve specific 
problems. To offer a flavor of the nature 
of the legislation, a few illustrations are in 
order. 

For example, the bill would make it possible 
for the Caswell and Montana Creek Native 
groups to receive approximately 11,520 acres 
of land pursuant to a February 3, 1976, agreement 
and subsequent March 26, 1992, letter 
of agreement with Cook Inlet Region Inc. 
[CIRI]. This will fulfill their land entitlement 
from CIRI under the ANCSA. 

Another provision would relieve ANCSA corporations 
of liability for hazardous wastes or 
contaminants left in, or on, ANCSA lands prior 
to their conveyance to Native corporations. It 
also directs the Secretary of the Interior to remove 
all contaminants left by the United 
States, an agent of the United States, or lessees 
prior to conveyance of these lands to the 
Native corporations. In some instances, the 
Government has conveyed lands and property 
interests to Alaska Natives which have been 
rendered valueless because of such contamination. 
It was clearly not the intention of 
ANCSA to extinguish Native claims by conveying 
contaminated property to recipients. 

The Chugach Alaska Kageet Point land selection 
provision would allow Chugach Alaska 
Native Corp. to select a specific tract of land 
at the edge of its own current boundaries. 

Mr. Speaker, I hope the spirit of cooperation 
which was reached last year will continue so 
we can move this noncontroversial piece of 
legislation early in this session. 

COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTIVE 

HEALTH AND PROMOTION ACT 

OF 1995, H.R. 23 

HON. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. GILMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce 
H.R. 23, legislation which will help 
produce a healthier nation. This measure will 
cover individuals for periodic health exams, as 
well as counseling and immunizations. 

The Comprehensive Preventive Health and 
Promotion Act of 1995 will direct the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services [HHS] to establish 
a schedule of preventive health care 
services and to provide for coverage of these 
services under private health insurance plans 
and health benefit programs of the Federal 
Government. 

More specifically, the Secretary of HHS, in 
consultation with representatives of the major 
health care groups, will establish a schedule 
of recommended preventive health care services. 
The list of preventive services will follow 
the guidelines published in the ‘‘Guide to Clinical 
Preventive Services’’ and the ‘‘Year 2000 
Health Objectives.’’ The preventive services 
will cover periodic health exams, health 
screening, counseling, immunizations, and 
health promotion. These services will be specified 
for males and females, and specific age 
groups. 

Additionally, HHS will publish and disseminate 
information on the benefits of practicing 
preventive health care, the importance of undergoing 
periodic health examinations, and the 
need to establish and maintain a family medical 
history to businesses, providers of health 
care services, and other appropriate groups 
and individuals. 

Moreover, prevention and health promotion 
workshops will be established for corporations 
and businesses, as well as for the Federal 
Government. A wellness program will be established 
to make grants over a 5-year period 
to 300 eligible employers to establish and conduct 
on-site workshops on health care promotion 
for employees. The wellness workshops 
can include: Counseling on nutrition 
and weight management, clinical sessions on 
avoiding back injury, programs on smoking 
cessation, and information on stress management. 


Finally, my legislation directs HHS to set up 
a demonstration project which will go to 50 
counties over a 5-year period to provide preventive 
health care services at health clinics. 
This program will cover preventive health care 
services for all children, and adults under a 
certain income level. If above the determined 
income level, fees will be based on a sliding 
scale. Additionally, the project will entail both 
urban and rural areas in different regions of 
our Nation to educate the public on the benefits 
of practicing preventive health care, the 
need for periodic health exams, and the need 
for establishing a medical history, as well as 
providing services. 

Mr. Speaker, we can all agree that our current 
health care system needs to be improved, 
and our Nation needs to become healthier. 
Experts have concluded that practicing preventive 
health care does work, and will 
produce a healthier nation. Although there is a 


E6 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 1995 

consensus on the benefits of practicing preventive 
health care, only approximately 20 
percent of health insurance companies offer 
coverage for periodic health exams. 

The Comprehensive Preventive Health and 
Promotion Act of 1995 has all the necessary 
ingredients that will be needed in a national 
health care plan, and will be applicable to that 
plan. 

Accordingly, to all my colleagues who share 
my concern regarding the importance of producing 
a healthier nation, I invite and urge you 
to cosponsor this measure, sending a clear 
message to our Nation’s citizens that Congress 
is taking steps to improve our Nation’s 
health care system. 

At this point I request that the full text of my 
bill be inserted in the RECORD for review by 
my colleagues: 

H.R. 23 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in

service plan contract, or health maintenance 
subscriber contract, or a multiple employer 
welfare arrangement or employee benefit 
plan (as defined under the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974) which 
provides benefits with respect to health care 
services, but does not include— 
(i) coverage only for accident, dental, vision, 
disability income, or long-term care insurance, 
or any combination thereof, 
(ii) medicare supplemental health insurance, 
(iii) coverage issued as a supplement to liability 
insurance, 
(iv) worker’s compensation or similar insurance, 
or 
(v) automobile medical-payment insurance, 
or any combination thereof.

means a carrier with respect to the issuance 
of an employer health benefit plan which 
provides coverage to one or more full-time 
employees of an entity actively engaged in 
business which, on at least 50 percent of its 
working days during the preceding year, employed 
at least 2, but fewer than 36, full-time 
employees. For purposes of determining if an 
employer is a small employer, rules similar 
to the rules of subsection (b) and (c) of section 
414 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
shall apply. 

(b) ENFORCEMENT THROUGH EXCISE TAX.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Chapter 43 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to qualified 
pension, etc., plans) is amended by adding at 
the end thereof the following new section: 
‘‘SEC. 4980C. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EMPLOYER 
HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN 
STANDARDS REGARDING PREVENTIVE 
HEALTH CARE. 

‘‘(a) IMPOSITION OF TAX.— 

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—There is hereby imposed 
a tax on the failure of a carrier or an employer 
health benefit plan to comply with 
section 3(a)(1) of the Comprehensive Preventive 
Health and Promotion Act of 199. 

‘‘(2) EXCEPTION.—Paragraph (1) shall not 
apply to a failure by a small employer carrier 
or plan in a State if the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services determines that 
the State has in effect a regulatory enforcement 
mechanism that provides adequate 
sanctions with respect to such a failure by 
such a carrier or of such a plan. 

‘‘(b) AMOUNT OF TAX.— 

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph (2), 
the tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be an 
amount not to exceed 25 percent of the 
amounts received by the carrier or under the 
plan for coverage during the period such failure 
persists. 

‘‘(2) LIMITATION IN CASE OF INDIVIDUAL FAILURES.—
In the case of a failure that only relates 
to specified individuals or employers 
(and not to the plan generally), the amount 
of the tax imposed by subsection (a) shall 
not exceed the aggregate of $100 for each day 
during which such failure persists for each 
individual to which such failure persists for 
each individual to which such failure relates. 
A rule similar to the rule of section 
4980B(b)(3) shall apply for purposes of this 
section. 

‘‘(c) LIABILITY FOR TAX.—The tax imposed 
by this section shall be paid by the carrier. 

‘‘(d) EXCEPTIONS.— 

‘‘(1) CORRECTIONS WITHIN 30 DAYS.—No tax 
shall be imposed by subsection (a) by reason 
of any failure if— 

‘‘(A) such failure was due to reasonable 
cause and not to willful neglect, and 

‘‘(B) such failure is corrected within the 30-
day period beginning on earliest date the 
carrier knew, or exercising reasonable diligence 
would have known, that such failure 
existed. 

‘‘(2) WAIVER BY SECRETARY.—In the case of 
a failure which is due to reasonable cause 
and not to willful neglect, the Secretary may 
waive part or all of the tax imposed by subsection 
(a) to the extent that payment of 
such tax would be excessive relative to the 
failure involved. 

‘‘(2) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this section, 
the terms ‘carrier’, ‘employer health 
benefit plan’, and ‘small employer carrier’ 
have the respective meanings given such 
terms in section 3(a)(2) of the Comprehensive 
Preventive Health and Promotion Act of 
1995.’’ 

(2) CLERICAL AMENDMENT.—The table of 
sections for chapter 43 of such Code is 
amended by adding at the end thereof the 
following new items:

health plan standards regarding 
preventive health 
care.’’.

CLEANING UP THE CLEAN AIR ACT 

HON. JAY KIM 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. KIM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce 
a very important piece of legislation 
which will help rectify a severely unfair application 
of the Clean Air Act. This bill, which 
was blocked by the then-majority Democrats 
in the 103d Congress, will provide my home 
State of California with the flexibility every 
other State in our Union currently enjoys. Specifically, 
this bill will direct the Environmental 
Protection Agency [EPA] to withhold the enactment 
of its Federal implementation plan 
[FIP], as ordered by the courts, until such time 
as it has an opportunity to review California’s 
State implementation plan [SIP]. 

We all want clean air—especially in California. 
Thus, my intentions are not to weaken 
clean air standards—and this legislation does 

not do so. Rather, it helps attain those standards 
within the context of full support for the 
principles of States rights. I do not believe the 
EPA, a Federal bureaucracy, has any right to 
completely dismantle those principles, even if 
the courts appear to be the real culprits in this 
game of high stakes chess. No longer can the 
Federal Government blindly push States into 
complying with laws which are not suited for 
their particular situations or problems. 

It is with that in mind that I call on my fellow 
colleagues to join in protecting the principles 
upon which this Nation was built. For those of 
my colleagues who do not represent the State 
of California, I remind them that this type of 
precedent could have equally devastating consequences 
in States such as Texas, Ohio, Virginia, 
and any others that do not meet the 
stringently set path that the big brother EPA 
dictates. Let us make it clear to all Americans 
that we, the Republican majority, will not stand 
idly by while the rights of our States are so 
easily swept aside. 

Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that committee 
and floor action can be taken expeditiously as 
this is a very time sensitive issue.

LINE-ITEM VETO LEGISLATION 

HON. BOB STUMP 

OF ARIZONA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. STUMP. Mr. Speaker, I am today introducing 
legislation to propose an amendment 
to the Constitution giving the President line-
item veto authority. This legislation is identical 
to the line-item veto bill I introduced last Congress. 


In years past, the leadership of this body 
worked hard to see that no real line-item veto 
bill passed the House. They argued that a true 
line-item veto would give too much power to 
the President. I disagreed then and I disagree 
now. 

In theory, Congress may not need the President’s 
help in deciding how best to spend the 
taxpayer’s money. However, in practice, the 
temptation to slip special interest or parochial 
spending programs into otherwise necessary 
appropriation bills has been too strong to resist. 
Allowing the President to identify and veto 
such programs would protect not only the 
budget process, but the taxpayers’ pockets. 

Mr. Speaker, the line-item veto has proven 
itself in State after State where it has been 
tried. There is no reason not to allow it at the 
Federal level.

IRS BURDEN OF PROOF 

HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR. 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, last year, I 
introduced H.R. 3261 to protect taxpayers 
from capricious behavior by the Internal Revenue 
Service. Today, I am again introducing 
this bill to ensure American taxpayers get a 
fair shake in tax court. Too often, the IRS is 
an agency out of control; too many Americans 
fear the IRS and that’s wrong. 

Mr. Speaker, my bill has three sections to 
protect Americans from IRS abuses. First, 

damages paid to the taxpayer are increased 
from $100,000, current law, to $1,000,000. 
Second, the Internal Revenue Service must 
notify the taxpayer promptly in writing upon request 
as to the specific implementing regulations 
that they are found liable for. No more 
ambiguous computer generated letters using 
code numbers. No more unprepared confrontations 
with the IRS. These two seemingly 
innocuous sections of my bill are extremely 
vital and will go a long way in rebuilding the 
American people’s faith in our Government. 

The last part of my bill is the most important: 
it shifts the burden of proof from the taxpayer 
to the IRS in civil tax cases. Under current 
law, if the IRS accuses someone of tax 
fraud, which could be an honest mistake on 
the 1040 form, he or she must prove his or 
her innocence in civil court, the IRS does not 
have to prove your guilt. An accused mass 
murderer has more rights than a taxpayer fingered 
by the IRS. Jeffrey Dahmer was considered 
innocent until proven guilty. Mom and 
Pop small business owners, however, are not 
afforded this protection. 

Mr. Speaker, during the last session, I highlighted 
the need for this legislation on the 
House floor by reading letters and cases I 
have received from people around the country. 
You may remember the case of David and 
Millie Evans from Longmont, CO. The IRS refused 
to accept their cancelled check as evidence 
of payment even though the check bore 
the IRS stamp of endorsement. Or how about 
Alex Council, who took his own life so his wife 
could collect his life insurance to pay off their 
IRS bill? Months later, a judge found him innocent 
of any wrongdoing. I have heard hundreds 
of stories of IRS abuses like these on 
radio and television talk shows. Thousands of 
Americans have written to me personally with 
their horror stories. 

Opponents argue that my bill will weaken 
IRS’s ability to prosecute legitimate tax cheats. 
This bill will not affect IRS’s ability to enforce 
tax law, it only forces them to prove allegations 
of fraud. My bill will ensure that IRS 
agents act in accordance with the standards of 
conduct required of all Department of Treasury 
employees and the Constitution of the United 
States of America where you are innocent 
until proven guilty. 

Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to cosponsor 
my new bill. It will be my No. 1 legislative 
goal for the 104th Congress. All I seek is fairness 
for the American people.

THE 1995 AGENDA 

HON. LEE H. HAMILTON 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
insert my Washington report for Wednesday, 
November 30, 1994, into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. 

THE 1995 AGENDA 
There is a deep, free-flowing discontent in 
the country today. It is difficult to pin down, 
but it seems to be a fear of the future—a 
sense of insecurity about jobs, health care, 
pensions, and the future of the family. Americans 
are anxious about their future and 
their children’s future in the rapidly changing 
economy. They are also disgusted with 
the performance of government. Hoosiers say 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E9 

to me over and over again that government 
should not try to rescue every one, that government 
should get off their backs, that they 
do not want to see their money spent on expanding 
programs when they are not getting 
enough bang for the buck now. In short, they 
want less welfare, less taxes, less spending, 
and, most of all, less government. They want 
to shake up Washington. 

AGENDA FOR 1995 
Although they oppose a big and intrusive 
government, Americans still have a long list 
of problems they want addressed. They want 
us to fix the economy, and for most of them 
that means boosting their incomes. They 
still want the health care system reformed. 
Americans are very concerned about the cost 
of health care and fear losing their insurance. 
They like the idea of universal coverage, 
and certainly want more control of 
health care costs. They do not want government 
control over health care decisions. 
They do not like the stresses put on the family, 
and want a more effective fight against 
crime. 
Americans want the size and cost of government 
reduced. They do not favor a passive 
government, but rather a government 
that helps them solve problems without 
overtaxing or overregulating. They feel that 
government does not benefit them, but benefits 
somebody else. They want a government 
that belongs to them. They surely want a reduction 
in taxes and serious welfare reform. 
Welfare reform outdistances even a tax cut 
for the middle class or health care as the top 
legislative priority of Americans. They want 
to end welfare dependency, but not end support 
for people struggling to be self-sufficient. 
Americans also want us to clean up 
politics. They do not approve of the way 
Congress operates and they think most Members 
have become disconnected from the 
lives of ordinary Americans. 
The agenda for the next Congress will likely 
revolve around several themes. First, 
shrink government. We need to sort out 
what is the reasonable role of government, 
what can be accomplished by government 
and what cannot, and what policy areas 
could be passed on to the states and private 
sector from a decentralized federal government. 
My hope is that in the next few years 
we can move toward decentralization and 
smaller institutions. Second, restore confidence 
in government. Several reforms are 
needed, including ethics reform, campaign finance 
and lobbying reform, and addressing 
the problem of negative campaigning. Policymakers 
need to govern from the center, 
and adopt a moderate, centrist approach to 
issues. Third, fix the economy. We need to 
build on recent successes in reducing the deficit, 
and pass a line-item veto and a balanced 
budget amendment. We should pass a middle-
income tax cut, provided we can find a way 
to pay for it and not add to the national 
debt. I worry about each side trying to up 
the tax cut proposal of the other side, with 
the result of a huge increase in the deficit. 
Fourth, improve personal security. We need 
to continue our efforts against crime, and 
work on scaled back health care reform and 
welfare reform. There is significant momentum 
for cutting back the welfare system, restructuring 
it, making it cost less. Fifth, 
bolster national defense. We need to shore up 
our national defense and improve readiness, 
and adopt a position of selective engagement—
not being the policeman of the world 
but intervening only when it is clearly in our 
national interest. 
DIFFICULTY OF GOVERNING IN AMERICA 
America has become a much harder place 
to govern than in the past. It has become 
larger, more diverse, more crowded. I am impressed 
with how the public’s demand for 

services collides with government’s eroding 
ability to respond. In many respects our political 
circuits today are overloaded, and it 
is difficult for elected officials to address obvious 
national problems in a deliberate, 
thoughtful, and thorough way. Interest 
groups clamor for more attention and more 
benefits and then defend them vigorously. 
With the clash of interest groups and 
ideologies, developing a consensus and putting 
together coalitions to pass legislation 
has become increasingly difficult. 

The public debate has become much more 
polarized. Interest groups are very effective 
at manipulating the voter. They understand 
that nothing rouses the faithful like a negative 
message denouncing the other side as 
evil incarnate. Polarized rhetoric and extreme 
positions arouse the faithful, and 
stimulate membership and contributions. At 
the same time, the news media seem to believe 
that the road to the truth lies in finding 
two extremes and letting them clash. 
They like to transform every discussion into 
a debate. They do not want a commentator 
interested in context, complexity, or mod-
eration—despite the fact that most Americans 
are not on the extremes but in the center. 


I am also impressed with how little confidence 
people have in the institutions of 
government. Press, television, talk radio, 
and politicians themselves enthusiastically 
join in undermining confidence in government 
today. I wonder how far this erosion in 
confidence can go and still have a functioning 
democracy. 

CONCLUSION 

Americans are demanding wholesale 
changes in Washington. They are perturbed 
by complex and disturbing trends of economic 
hardship, crime, the decline of the 
family and family values, and the erosion of 
the American dream. They are taking a long, 
hard, skeptical look at the condition of their 
government, and they do not like what they 
see—too much wasteful spending, too much 
bureaucracy, too much intrusion into their 
lives, too little in the way of results. 

Policymakers must sort out what government 
can still usefully do and what it cannot 
do. We must prove to Americans that their 
institutions of government can still achieve 
something and are worth preserving. We 
need to be advocates of good sense and effective, 
unapologetic government but also a 
government that understands its limits. We 
also need to be more honest with Americans, 
letting them know that they cannot have 
benefits without paying the cost of them.

FISHERY CONSERVATION AND 

MANAGEMENT AMENDMENTS OF 

1985 

HON. DON YOUNG 

OF ALASKA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, today 
I am introducing the Fishery Conservation and 
Management Amendments of 1995. In the last 
Congress the Merchant Marine and Fisheries 
Committee held 11 hearings in 5 different 
States and received testimony from over 100 
witnesses. These witnesses represented all 
segments of the fisheries industries and other 
interested parties including fishermen, processors, 
environmentalists, State government 
officials, and administrative agencies. Near the 
end of the 103d Congress the Fisheries Management 
Subcommittee reported a bill which 

unfortunately was not considered by the full 
Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. 

Today, I am introducing legislation to re-authorize 
and amend the Magnuson Fisheries 
Conservation and Management Act. The bill 
contains nearly identical language to the bill 
reported by the subcommittee last year. The 
major differences involve the removal of certain 
controversial provisions, inclusion of 
stronger language addressing the bycatch 
issue and the unique needs of certain rural 
Alaskan fishermen, as well as some changes 
that would have been made had the bill been 
addressed by the full committee last year. 

This legislation addresses all of the major 
concerns discussed during our series of hearings 
in the last Congress. While some may not 
totally agree with the way we address some of 
these concerns, I think this legislation takes a 
major step in continuing the management of 
our Nation’s fisheries while also addressing 
some of the problems we have encountered in 
specific areas of fisheries management. 

Mr. Speaker, there are two areas of concern 
that I feel must be addressed by this re-authorization 
legislation. We must allow the Regional 
Fishery Management Councils to address 
the issue of bycatch. The councils are in 
a unique position to create specific bycatch reduction 
measures, tailored for each fishery 
that they manage. I have also always believed 
that community development quotas [CDQs] 
are a legitimate tool of the councils for use in 
managing our fisheries resources. I have always 
believed that CDQ’s did not have to be 
specifically authorized for the councils to include 
them in their first fisheries management 
plans and the courts have now finally agreed 
with me on this point. Community development 
quotas are just one of many tools which 
can be used by the councils to address the 
needs of fishery dependent communities. We 
will continue to look at this issue as we move 
those legislation. 

Mr. Speaker, it is my intention to move 
quickly with the bill, so that we can get on with 
the sound management of our Nation’s fisheries 
resources. Our fishermen and processors 
deserve no less.

REDECLARE THE DRUG WAR 

HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, we cannot 
solve the crime and violence problems which 
plague this country without an all-out war on 
drugs. Make no mistake about it. This Republican-
controlled Congress will pay a major role 
in the war on drugs. We’ll step up to the plate 
and assume our full share of responsibility. 
But so must the administration. Our first, joint 
priority must be to restore control over the 
places where Americans live and raise their 
children. 

As a consequence of the Clinton administration’s 
half-hearted effort to fight the drug war 
we have witnessed a dramatic increase in the 
use of drugs. Unless the problem is returned 
to the front burner one of the few enduring 
legacies of the Clinton Presidency may be the 
reemergence of illegal drugs and the violent 
crime associated with drugs. 


E10 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 1995 

The American people understand that we 
cannot solve the crime and violence problem 
which plagues this country, without an all-out 
effort to resolve the drug problem. The root 
cause of violence and crime in this country is 
illegal drugs. Look at the facts. According to 
the Partnership for a Drug-Free America: 

Drug use is related to half of all violent 
crime. 

Illegal drugs play a part in half of all homicides. 
In fact, 48 percent of all men arrested 
for homicide test positive for illicit drugs at the 
time of arrest. 

Over 60 percent of prison inmates are there 
for drug related crimes. 

Illegal drug use is a factor in half of all family 
violence. Most of this violence is directed 
against women. 

Over 30 percent of all child abuse cases involve 
a parent using illegal drugs. 

The number of drug-exposed babies now 
accounts for 11 percent of all births in the 
United States. 

Over 75 percent of adolescent deaths are a 
result of drug related violence. 

An important first step in curbing drug demand 
in this country is to make the so-called 
casual users and hard core users accountable. 
The best method to accomplish this involves 
testing in the workplace. By requiring 
the testing of all Government employees and 
officials we can set the standard for the private 
sector. The bill being introduced today 
was drafted by constitutional scholars in response 
to possible court challenges. 

The findings provision states that the sale, 
possession and use of drugs pose a pervasive 
and substantial threat to the social, educational, 
and economic health of the United 
States. The impact of drug abuse if reflected 
in the violence that it causes and in the disintegration 
of families, schools, and neighborhoods. 
The effects of rampant drug use is 
amply illustrated by national violent crime statistics 
across the United States. And recent 
studies demonstrate that drug use by young 
people is on the rise. 

The legislation introduced today is a starting 
point of the action this Congress must take to 
turn around the war on drugs, including: 

A bill to require random drug testing of all 
executive, judicial, and legislative branch Government 
employees and officials. 

A bill to deny Federal benefits upon conviction 
of certain drug offenses. 

A bill to ensure quality assurance of drug 
testing programs. 

A bill to require employer notification for certain 
drug crimes. 

A bill to require mandatory drug testing for 
all Federal job applicants. 

A bill to provide the death penalty for drug 
kingpins. 

A bill to prohibit federally sponsored research 
involving the legalization of drugs. 

A bill to deny higher education assistance to 
individuals convicted of using or selling illegal 
drugs. 

These bills will increase user accountability. 
It is imperative that we put tough new laws on 
the books to hold both casual and heavy drug 
users accountable. These new laws will establish 
that involvement with illegal drugs has 
clear consequences. We must increase the 
social and legal costs of illegal drug consumption. 


Mr. Speaker, I would conclude by quoting 
the chairman of the Partnership for a Drug 

Free America, Mr. James Burke, ‘‘We cannot 
and will not make progress with crime, violence 
or other ills until we make a long-term 
commitment to addressing a common denominator 
in so many of these problems—drug 
abuse.’’

INTERSTATE CHILD SUPPORT ACT 

HON. BARBARA B. KENNELLY 

OF CONNECTICUT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mrs. KENNELLY. Mr. Speaker, during the 
next few months, there will be considerable 
debate about personal responsibility. One of 
the most important parts of this discussion will 
focus on parents’ responsibility to nurture and 
support their children. Let me emphatically 
state that this obligation rests with both parents. 
All too often, the mother is left to shoulder 
this burden alone. There are both societal 
costs and personal tragedies that could be 
averted if we can successfully change this culture 
of neglect. We must send a clear message 
that both parents are legally and morally 
bound to support their children and then be 
prepared to track down those parents unwilling 
to live up to their obligations. 

While past legislation has improved collections 
for child support, we as a Nation still 
have a long way to go. Only half of all custodial 
parents receive their full child support 
awards, leaving millions of children without 
adequate support. Congress must end this 
disgrace. 

Although the Republican Contract With 
America sets out few details on child support 
enforcement, I believe this is an issue that we 
can act on with broad bipartisan support. I am 
therefore reintroducing child support legislation 
that reflects many of the recommendations of 
the U.S. Commission on Interstate Child Support, 
on which I served. The bill would enhance 
coordination for collecting child support 
across state lines, improve Federal tracking of 
delinquent orders, institute direct wage withholding, 
withhold business and driver’s licenses 
from individuals owing child support, 
and deny Federal benefits to individuals with 
large child support arrearages. 

It is certainly worth noting that welfare reform 
cannot succeed without better child support 
enforcement. We cannot ask young, poor 
mothers to go out and get a job, only to let 
young fathers evade their responsibility. Not 
only would enhanced child support enforcement 
reimburse certain welfare costs, but in 
some cases it may prevent families from going 
on welfare in the first place. 

I ask my colleagues to join me today in 
sending a clear message that both parents 
have a responsibility to provide for their children.

FORCED BUSING MUST STOP 

HON. BILL EMERSON 

OF MISSOURI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. EMERSON. Mr. Speaker, the Clinton 
administration recently decided that over $1.3 
billion of Missouri tax dollars are not enough. 

Since 1981, taxpayers in the State of Missouri 
have watched as their money constructed an 
Olympic swimming pool, supported fencing 
teams, and financed court-ordered forced busing. 
And now, when nearly everyone in Missouri 
has come to agree that desegragation 
efforts have failed miserably, the Clinton Administration 
wants the State to do more than 
spend money, it wants the State to show results 
for students. 

Unfortunately, the administration does not 
understand what people have been saying for 
years: increased education spending does not 
automatically lead to increased learning. At 
the same time that the State of Missouri has 
been struggling to meet its court-ordered obligations 
in Kansas City and St. Louis, children 
in the rest of the State have gone without in 
their schools. Enough is enough. 

I am extremely concerned that instead of 
admitting that forced busing does not work, 
the administration wants to broaden 
desegragation efforts. In fact, the Clinton administration 
is working against Missouri’s efforts 
before the Supreme Court because it is 
worried that if the Supreme Court sides with 
the people of Missouri, it could become easier 
for dozens of other jurisdictions nationwide to 
end school desegragation cases. This is 
wrong, and once again I am introducing legislation 
to amend the U.S. Constitution and prohibit 
any governmental entity—including Federal 
courts—from compelling a child to attend 
a public school other than the public school 
nearest the student’s residence. 

While I am hopeful that the Supreme Court 
will correctly decide in favor of the State of 
Missouri and against the Clinton administration, 
this legislation is necessary to ensure 
children, parents and communities are protected 
from liberal civil rights lawyers, Federal 
courts and Washington bureaucrats. I urge my 
colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. 
If court-ordered desegragation is not currently 
happening in their districts, it is most 
likely only a matter of time before they find 
themselves in the same situation as the people 
of Missouri. This resolution will prevent this 
disastrous situation from repeating itself 
across the Nation.

INTRODUCTION OF IRA PROPOSAL 

HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 

OF MASSACHUSETTS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, 
today I am introducing the Individual Retirement 
Options Improvement Act of 1995. This 
legislation makes changes to the Internal Revenue 
Code to improve Individual Retirement 
Accounts [IRA’s]. 

The purpose of this legislation is to increase 
our national savings rate. The legislation consists 
of two major components which are to 
encourage savings by increasing the amount 
of deductible contributions which may be 
made to an individual retirement account and 
to allow homemakers to be eligible for the full 
IRA deduction. First, the legislation allows an 
individual who is an active participant to deduct 
the allowable amount and to deduct 50 
percent of the excess amount for that taxable 
year. This provision increases the deductible 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E11 

amount which individual taxpayers are currently 
allowed for IRA’s. The legislation does 
not increase the $2,000 limit. Second, the legislation 
addresses the spousal IRA issue. The 
legislation allows homemakers to make the 
same deductible IRA contribution as their 
working spouses. 

The purpose of this legislation is to increase 
our national savings rate. IRA’s are a proven 
tool to boost our savings rate. This legislation 
increases the amount that can be deductible 
in an IRA. Taxes are just deferred. The focus 
of this proposal is savings for retirement. A 
new analysis commissioned by Merrill Lynch 
on the financial wealth of American families 
shows that half of American families currently 
have below $1,000 in net financial assets. Action 
needs to be taken to improve this statistic. 

Allowing homemakers to contribute the full 
amount to an IRA corrects an inequity and 
creates an incentive for savings. Increased retirement 
savings will result in economic growth 
and help retirees become financially independent. 
We have to encourage individuals to 
save for their retirement. This legislation is a 
step in the right direction. I urge you to support 
this legislation.

THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION 
ACT OF 1995 

HON. TOBY ROTH 

OF WISCONSIN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. ROTH. Mr. Speaker, today I have introduced 
the Export Administration Act of 1995. 
The text of this bill generally reflects the provisions 
reported to the House last year by the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs, together with 
certain of the modifications recommended to 
the House last year by other committees. Title 
I of this bill originated with legislation that I introduced 
in the 103d Congress as H.R. 3412. 

As the chairman of the Subcommittee on 
International Economic Policy and Trade of 
the Committee on International Relations, I intend 
to renew the effort to reform our export 
control system and see it through to completion, 
with enactment of reform legislation. 

The legislation I have introduced today is 
the starting point for this final push to enactment. 
In essence, we are picking up where 
our committee left off last year. Prior to acting 
on this legislation, our subcommittee will consult 
with other members of our committee, 
with other committees and interested Members 
and with representatives of the President 
as well as other interested parties. Refinements 
and modifications will be made and reflected 
in a measure which will be presented 
to the subcommittee for its consideration and 
approval as soon as possible. 

My goal is simple: To reform our outdated 
export control system, help our high technology 
industries and create new American 
jobs. 

The last time Congress reformed the Export 
Administration Act was in 1979, some 15 
years ago. The last time it was amended in 
any significant way was in 1988. Therefore, 
the current law simply does not reflect the profound 
changes which have occurred during 
the past 5 years alone: the end of the Cold 
War and COCOM; the new challenge of proliferation; 
the breakup of the Soviet empire; 

the beginnings of a market economy in China; 
the diffusion worldwide of advanced computer 
and communications technology; and the advent 
of a new global trade agreement. 

Yet our export control system still operates 
under an old statute, needlessly impeding 
many high technology exports while not adequately 
focusing on proliferation threats. Testimony 
last year to our subcommittee indicated 
that some $30 billion in American exports are 
affected by this outmoded system, together 
with the thousands of jobs which would otherwise 
be created by reforming the system. 

In introducing this legislation, I welcome recommendations 
from my colleagues on how 
this bill can be further strengthened. 

I intend to continue our subcommittee’s tradition 
of approaching legislation in an effective 
bi-partisan manner and to bring to the House 
a bill that every Member can vote for and that 
the President can sign into law.

BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT 
LEGISLATION 

HON. BOB STUMP 

OF ARIZONA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. STUMP. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
today to reintroduce a balanced budget 
amendment. This amendment, if ratified by 
three-fourths of the States, will mandate that 
the President submit and Congress pass a 
balanced Federal budget. 

The last budget Congress balanced was in 
1969. Since then, both deficits and the national 
debt have soared to astronomical levels. 
We must put an end to this obscene accumulation 
of debt or face the prospect of a national 
bankruptcy. 

Mr. Speaker, there are many in this body 
who will say that the balanced budget amendment 
is not needed, or that to balance the 
budget we will have to cut vital and important 
programs to the bone. Nothing could be further 
from the truth. 

While it is true that Congress has always 
possessed the ability to balance the budget, 
the fact that it hasn’t done so in 26 years indicates 
that a balanced budget has not been 
among Congress’ top priorities. And while it is 
also true that things have changed around 
here, what has not changed is the threat our 
national debt poses to the economic futures of 
our children and grandchildren. We must assure 
them that we will do everything in our 
power to allow them to live in a debt-free nation. 


I am sensitive to the concerns expressed by 
those who fear a wholesale slaughter of vital 
and important Federal programs. To be sure, 
balancing the budget will not be without a certain 
degree of pain and sacrifice. However, it 
would not require the wholesale dismantling of 
vital programs, such as Social Security, that 
its critics allege. Indeed, balancing the Federal 
budget could only strengthen Social Security 
and other programs whose trust funds are invested 
in Government securities. 

Mr. Speaker, the people of this country 
voted for change—for a different approach to 
government. We should give it to them. I can 
think of no better starting point than to pass a 
balanced budget amendment. 

INVESTMENT IN AMERICA ACT 

HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR. 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, every session 
since coming to Congress in 1985, I have 
introduced a bill to reinstate a 10-percent domestic 
investment tax credit [ITC] for the purchase 
of domestic durable goods. I am reintroducing 
this bill today, and I invite all Members 
to become cosponsors. 

Mr. Speaker, as you know, the Ways and 
Means Committee intends to overhaul tax policy 
in the upcoming 104th session. I believe 
my 10-percent investment tax credit bill should 
be considered as a part of that new tax plan. 

The way this bill works could not be simpler. 
If an American consumer buys a domestic 
product like a new machine or computer to improve 
their business, the consumer can take a 
10-percent tax credit if that product was made 
in America. If the consumer purchases a new 
American-made automobile or truck, they can 
take a 10-percent tax credit. The tax credit 
would be worth up to $1,000. 

Investment tax credits are not new, but mine 
incorporates Buy American language to assist 
economic enhancement. I believe that repealing 
the investment tax credit in 1986 was one 
of the major reasons for the downfall in investment. 
As a result, American companies are 
competing with one hand tied behind their 
backs. Under my bill, at least 60 percent of 
the basis of the product must be attributable to 
value within the United States to take advantage 
of the credit. In other words, language 
the Commerce Department already uses to 
define an American-made product. 

The purpose of the Investment in America 
tax credit is to stimulate the economy by spurring 
consumers and businesses to purchase 
American-made goods to enhance our long-
term competitiveness. I don’t know of a simpler 
way to change our complex tax policy for 
the better. I have always argued that the social 
problems this country faces can be linked 
to the unfair and harmful trade and tax policies 
enacted by the Congress. The 104th Congress 
offers us a unique opportunity to make 
a difference in the direction this country is 
headed. 

Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to cosponsor 
my bill. As a Congress, we need to show 
the American people that we are sincere 
about making America a strong nation once 
again.

THE NEW CONGRESS 

HON. LEE H. HAMILTON 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
insert my Washington Report for Wednesday, 
November 16, 1994, into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. 

THE NEW CONGRESS 
The 104th Congress that convenes in January 
will have both the House and Senate 
under Republican control for the first time 
since 1955. That changed makeup as well as 
the current mood of the country say a lot 


E12 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 1995 

about the congressional agenda and about 
how the President will have to deal with 
Congress. 

THE NEW MAKEUP OF CONGRESS 
The shift of Congress to Republican control 
will have a major impact on the legislative 
agenda. 
I hope that one lesson for the new Congress 
is that both parties recognize they have to 
treat each other with greater respect. Power 
imposes responsibility, and it is much tougher 
to govern than make calls from the 
bleachers. I hope one result of the election is 
to make politicians think about Congress as 
an institution and what needs to be done to 
improve it. 
Members of Congress also need to get a 
firmer grasp on the difference between doing 
what is right for tomorrow and what is politically 
popular for today. We have to get a 
longer-term perspective into our politics. We 
must ask what our country is going to be 
like when we reach the twenty-first century, 
how we can keep the economy strong and 
prosperous, and how we can assure that our 
children have jobs and opportunity for personal 
fulfillment. 
THE MOOD OF THE COUNTRY 
The current mood of the country also 
shapes what issues will be tackled by the 
104th Congress. 
The mood of the country is often described 
as anti-government. My own judgement is 
that Americans primarily oppose wasteful, 
duplicative, and corrupt government. They 
are prepared to support government that delivers 
services efficiently. They are saying 
that the growth of government needs to be 
curbed and that the performance of government 
needs to be improved. In a broader 
sense, Americans think the country is losing 
its moral roots and that politicians are not 
doing anything about it. They want more attention 
to traditional values as well as an 
improved level of government performance. 
Americans are alienated from government, 
their elected representatives, and the political 
process. They feel a deepening powerlessness 
and pessimism over the future of the 
nation. As one Hoosier put it to me, ‘‘I don’t 
really feel that the people of this country 
have any control over what is going on.’’ 
There is a feeling that the country has become 
too big, too complicated, too diverse. 
Again and again, Americans say they are 
uneasy about their future and feel that they 
are not getting ahead. One principal reason 
for this is that the job market is changing in 
swift and unpredictable ways. People are no 
longer sure that even with two incomes in 
the family they can maintain their standard 
of living. Their feeling that things might get 
worse and their deep sense of insecurity are 
very difficult for a politician to deal with. 
I find Americans distressed about many aspects 
of society today: the amount of violence 
and vulgarity, the rise of illegitimacy, 
the decay of responsibility, the loss of traditional 
values. The real message is their fear 
of the future. They are deeply concerned 
about crime, job security, retirement income, 
and adequate health care. They express 
a feeling that something is eating away 
at the security of their lives. 
Americans certainly support welfare reform 
and tax cuts. They have a strong view 
that the tax burden on middle-class families 
has risen steadily in recent decades and that 
there has been a decline in real income. 
Americans are turned inward and they worry 
about their own financial difficulties. They 
have become less interested in foreign affairs 
and the problems of the poor and the minorities 
in this country. 
Congress has been dealing with many of 
the problems people want addressed—the deficit, 
jobs, welfare reform, making govern


ment leaner and more effective. We are not 
dealing with those problems satisfactorily 
from their standpoint. Often they are not 
aware of what has been done. 

Americans have become much more interested 
in local concerns. Many of them feel 
the federal government is no longer as important 
as it once was. They have redefined 
what is really important to them. The closer 
politics is to their home and their family, 
the more important it is to them. In many 
communities, I find that infrastructure improvements 
and personal security for their 
families are the dominant concerns. 

It is clear that policymakers need to sort 
out which roles should be played by federal, 
state, and local governments and which 
should be shared with the private sector. 
There is certainly a strong feeling among the 
voters that the federal government is simply 
trying to do too much. 

THE PRESIDENT’S APPROACH TO CONGRESS 
With the changes in the 104th Congress, the 
President confronts two approaches about 
how to deal with his legislative agenda. He 
can push ahead with comprehensive changes 
in health care and welfare. He knows he will 
not succeed, but he could put the blame on 
Congress for refusing to pass his programs. 
The other approach is to try to work out 
agreements with the Republicans. 
I would urge the President to proceed on a 
path of compromise. He will have to work to 
develop a spirit of bi-partisanship. That will 
not be easy. In effect, he will have to govern 
from the middle. But, of course, it takes two 
to make a deal and the Republicans will 
want their agenda to be given priority. If the 
President tries bi-partisanship and it fails, 
he will have little choice but to go on the offensive. 
My advice to the President is that he has 
to broaden his political base by governing 
from the center out, not from the left in. He 
needs to forge an alliance with the new members 
of Congress who are very close to their 
constituents and in tune with the new politics 
of the country.

INTRODUCING LEGISLATION CON


CERNING KENAI NATIVES ASSO


CIATION, INC. 

HON. DON YOUNG 

OF ALASKA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I am 
introducing legislation today to correct a significant 
inequity in Federal law with respect to 
land uses of property conveyed to the Kenai 
Natives Association, Inc. [KNA]. The legislation, 
which will mark the final outcome of a 
process begun nearly 14 years ago and which 
was the subject of a congressional hearing 
last Congress and the enactment of one interim 
law, would correct the land entitlement 
inequities of KNA by authorizing and directing 
the completion of a land exchange and acquisition 
package. The legislation will allow KNA 
for the first time to make economic use of the 
majority of lands conveyed to the corporation 
under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement 
Act of 1971. 

We began the final stage in this process by 
directing, through enactment of Public Law 
102–458, an expedited negotiation of a land 
acquisition package between the Fish and 
Wildlife Service and KNA. Over the past year, 
negotiations were completed, resulting in a 
package which is identical to the elements of 
the legislation I am introducing today. 

KNA has waited since 1982 to resolve its 
land selection problem with property which is 
within the boundaries of the Kenai National 
Wildlife Refuge. KNA has reached a tentative 
agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service with an exchange agreement on lands 
within the refuge. I believe that they have waited 
long enough for ratification of the agreement 
and believe they deserve to have this 
behind them. This legislation will authorize and 
direct the Secretary to make an offer to KNA 
to complete an exchange and acquisition of 
lands owned by KNA. 

This legislation represents an agreement 
reached during the 103d Congress. It is my intention 
to move this legislation quickly and get 
it behind us. I urge my colleagues support so 
that KNA can move forward with their agenda. 

I am pleased with the efforts by KNA, its 
former president, the late Katherine Boling, 
and board of directors as well as the Fish and 
Wildlife Service to finalize this acquisition. 
KNA and the Fish and Wildlife Service have 
set aside past differences and have resolved 
the land use disagreement which has prevented 
KNA from using most of its lands conveyed 
under ANCSA. At the same time, another 
purpose of Public Law 102–458 and, a 
Federal goal, was acquiring for public ownership 
land along the Kenai River. These missions 
would be accomplished by the legislation 
I am introducing today. 

The Service has completed all the necessary 
negotiations on land acquisitions and 
exchange components and completed the 
necessary public review and legal reviews required 
for exchanges in Alaska. I commend 
the Service for their efforts to acquire a key 
parcel of land along the Kenai River, inside 
the boundaries of the Kenai National Wildlife 
Refuge, for public use. This acquisition is the 
crucial component of this legislation. Just as 
crucial is the need to allow KNA to make economic 
use of lands conveyed to the corporation 
to settle native land claims. It is wrong 
under any sense of fairness or the law to convey 
lands to native corporations in settlement 
of recognized land claims yet at the same time 
prohibit the use of those lands. 

Mr. Speaker, we need innovative measures 
to resolve land use conflicts in Alaska. Secretary 
Babbitt has noted the need for innovative 
exchanges throughout the Nation to properly 
manage Federal lands. This legislation 
represents a fine example of an exchange 
which resolves a longstanding land dispute on 
a voluntary basis. 

I believe we can and should resolve this dispute 
on a voluntary basis. If we fail to do so, 
the result will only be ill-will, an extreme inequity 
to the Alaska Natives of KNA, litigation 
and the loss of an important opportunity to acquire 
public, riverfront lands, along the Kenai 
River. Further, there will remain a significant 
doubt that any land use conflict involving Federal 
lands in Alaska can be resolved in a cooperative 
fashion. 

Mr. Speaker, I have worked closely with the 
former chairman of the Natural Resources 
Committee, Mr. MILLER, on this matter for 
many years. I believe we have an opportunity 
to correct an inequity, acquire valuable habitat, 
and show that innovative answers to land use 
problems will work in Alaska. I am anxious to 
move forward on this legislation which resolves 
this matter on a voluntary, willing seller

THE MILITARY RECRUITER 
CAMPUS ACCESS ACT 

HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing 
the Military Recruiter Campus Access 
Act, which would deny all Federal funds 
to educational institutions that bar or impair 
military recruiting. As you know, this phenomenon 
has proliferated across the country 
in recent years. 

This has outraged me for years, Mr. Speaker. 
Simply justice demands that we not give 
taxpayer dollars to institutions which are interfering 
with the Federal Government’s constitutionally 
mandated function of raising a military. 
Further, with the defense drawdown, recruiting 
the most highly qualified candidates from 
around the country has become even more 
important. 

Last year, we began to deal with this injustice 
with the overwhelming passage of my 
amendment to the fiscal year 1995 DOD authorization 
bill which, with the support of Senator 
NICKLES, became law on October 1. That 
law, which denies any DOD funds from going 
to colleges and universities which are discriminating 
against recruiters, has already begun to 
have some positive effect. I am told by the 
Pentagon that schools across the country are 
getting the message and preparing to accommodate 
recruiters rather than lose their precious 
funding. 

But to pick up the stragglers who are still 
not complying, further action is necessary. We 
have additional leverage, Mr. Speaker. My 
amendment last year covered only DOD 
funds, which amount to roughly $3 billion annually. 
But the Federal Government provides 
an additional $8 billion annually in grant and 
contract funding to colleges and universities 
through other departments and agencies such 
as HHS, Agriculture, and the National Science 
Foundation. 

Barring military recruiters is an intrusion on 
Federal prerogatives, a slap in the face to our 
Nation’s fine military personnel, and an impediment 
to sound national security policy. We 
should draw the line on this in the 104th Congress, 
Mr. Speaker, I urge bipartisan support 
for the bill.

INTRODUCTION OF PREPAYMENT 

OF LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS 

BILL 

HON. BARBARA B. KENNELLY 

OF CONNECTICUT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mrs. KENNELLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce legislation which has had strong 
bipartisan support in the past, legislation to 
provide for the prepayment of death benefits 
on life insurance contracts for the terminally ill. 

I first introduced this legislation in the 101st 
Congress. It had over 100 bipartisan cospon


sors in the 102d Congress. I subsequently 
worked closely with the Bush administration in 
its attempt to accomplish this important goal 
by regulation. The regulations, however, were 
not final when the Clinton administration took 
office and have not been finalized. The Clinton 
administration included this provision in the 
President’s Health Care plan and it was subsequently 
included in both the Ways and 
Means Committee and Mitchell Health Care 
bills. A version of this legislation is also included 
in the Republican contract. 

This legislation would allow individuals who 
are certified by a physician to have a terminal 
illness or injury which can reasonably be expected 
to result in death within 12 months, to 
receive the proceeds of their life insurance 
contracts on a tax free basis. 

I believe that access to these assets will 
make the lives of the terminally ill significantly 
easier with little cost to the Federal Government. 


Under current law. life insurance proceeds 
payable on death are generally tax free. This 
legislation, therefore, should have only a minor 
revenue impact in that the only change would 
be one of timing—tax free receipt of life insurance 
proceeds one year earlier than otherwise 
would be the case. 

In addition, access to these assets is critical 
to those many terminally ill individuals, who 
have no health insurance. To the extent that 
these individuals tap their life insurance policies 
to pay their final health care costs,. Federal 
dollars will be saved.

ENGLISH IS OUR COMMON THREAD 

HON. BILL EMERSON 

OF MISSOURI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. EMERSON. Mr. Speaker, many times 
before I have taken to the floor to speak about 
the importance of the English language. For 
decades, English has been the de facto language 
of the United States. In recent years, 
19 States have designated English as their official 
language. Support for these efforts has 
been overwhelming. I strongly believe that 
English should be the official language of the 
United States Government. I have been a persistent 
sponsor of such legislation, and I will 
again today introduce the Language of Government 
Act. 

At the same time, however, I want to recognize 
the important contributions of other languages 
through a sense-of-the-Congress resolution. 
In an increasingly global world, foreign 
languages are key to international communication. 
I strongly encourage those who already 
speak English to learn foreign languages. 

As a nation of immigrants, America is comprised 
of people of all races, nationalities, and 
languages. These differences make our Nation 
the wonderful place it is. While being different, 
all of these people can find a common means 
of communication in the English language. 
English is the common thread that connects 
every citizen in our great Nation. 

MAKING THE POSTAL SERVICE 
MORE COMPETITIVE 

HON. PHILIP M. CRANE 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, remember that 
lame old excuse, ‘‘the check is in the mail.’’ In 
days gone by, those who heard it hoped and 
prayed it was true. For if it was, they knew 
that they would soon be getting their money. 

Not so today. As far too many people have 
found out, putting the check in the mail gives 
neither the sender nor the would-be recipient 
any assurance whatsoever that it will actually 
arrive at its intended destination. Or that it will 
get there in time to avoid late charges or black 
marks on one’s credit rating. 

Over and over this past year, we heard stories 
about mail being dumped, burned or 
stashed by mail carriers or hidden away in 
warehouses by postal managers not wanting 
to admit how far behind their delivery efforts 
had fallen. At least a half dozen of these instances 
occurred in the Chicago area alone. 

On top of that, reports of slow mail delivery 
have been too numerous to mention. As a result, 
people have lost confidence in the Postal 
Service and remedies such as a new $7 million 
logo or a 3-cent increase in the cost of 
first class postage have done nothing to restore 
it. 

To be fair, the U.S. Postal Service [USPS] 
has made repeated efforts in recent months to 
improve the quality and timeliness of its service. 
But this is not the first time questions 
have been raised about the USPS’s performance 
or that attempts to improve it have been 
made. To the contrary, there has been enough 
past efforts, the Postal Reorganization Act of 
1970 being the most prominent, to suggest 
that a whole new approach is needed. 

Generally speaking, most USPS employees 
are conscientious, hard working individuals 
who want to do a good job. For the most part, 
the problem is not so much with them as it is 
with the system in which they operate. Put 
simply, that system lacks the incentives necessary 
to bring about the gains in productivity 
and customer service that are essential if the 
USPS is to live up to the public’s expectations. 
For one thing, the USPS is insulated against 
competition in the delivery of first class mail 
which means customers need not be won over 
but can be taken for granted. For another, it 
is subsidized by the Federal Government, 
which means there is less pressure to be efficient. 
For a third, it does not have the bottom 
line incentives—such as the profit motive and 
profit-sharing arrangements—which make 
many private companies so productive. 

A quick look at the parcel delivery business 
bears out this assessment. Thirty years ago, 
most all parcels were delivered by the Postal 
Service. Today, competitors like FED-EX, 
UPS, and DHL handle a vast majority of packages 
shipped around the country, despite the 
built-in advantages enjoyed by the USPS. 
Also, the growing movement towards corporate 
competition in, or the privatization of, 
postal services in other countries reinforces 
that hypothesis. New Zealand, for instance, 
converted its postal service from a government 
department to a state owned but decontrolled 
corporation in the late 1980’s and has 


E14 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 1995 

watched it flourish ever since. Last year, Holland 
partially privatized its postal service and 
Germany is doing the same starting this 
month. Also, there has been considerable discussion 
in Great Britain about the possibility of 
privatizing parts of the Royal Mail and 
Parcelforce, a move favored by a number of 
its top managers. 

In this country, the objection to privatization 
has been that it would result—allegedly—in 
cream skimming by USPS competitors which 
would leave the USPS with the financially 
troublesome prospect of being left with only 
rural and bulk mail to deliver. However, the 
logic behind such an assumption not only 
does a disservice to the capabilities of USPS 
employees but it overlooks the significance of 
the telecommunications revolution now underway. 
What with the growing popularity of FAX 
machines, modems, internet, E-mail and the 
like, the truth of the matter is that the USPS 
is more likely to be left with rural and bulk mail 
to deliver if it doesn’t go private than if it does. 
Only by keeping up with the times and the 
competition, which can best be done by operating 
in the same way as the competition, can 
be USPS hope to thrive in the future. 

Understandably, many USPS employees, 
fearing for their jobs, have certain reservations 
about going that route. Since change often 
breeds uncertainty and uncertainty is unsettling, 
such a reaction is only natural. However, 
change also brings opportunity and that would 
certainly be true if the USPS were to be converted 
into a private corporation. And it would 
be especially true if that corporation were to 
be an employee owned one. Not only would 
the new entity be able to explore new markets 
and develop new ways of doing business, 
both of which could benefit postal workers, but 
making it employee owned would give workers 
more control over their futures as well as a 
share of the profits. 

For all these reasons, I have decided to introduce 
once again legislation that would convert 
the U.S. Postal Service into a totally private, 
employee-owned corporation. As was 
the case with my previous bills to this effect, 
this measure calls for this transition to be implemented 
over a 5 year period, after which 
the USPS’s current monopoly over the delivery 
of first class mail would end. However, 
there is one difference between this bill and 
my previous legislation. To make the prospects 
for the success of this new private sector 
corporation even more likely and attractive, 
the measure I am introducing today calls for 
the cost-free transfer of the assets held by the 
USPS to that corporation. Now only will that 
make the transition to private status easier to 
arrange, but it will speed the day when American 
taxpayers will no longer have to subsidize 
an operation that has been losing money as 
well as the mail. 

Given the clear need for more than just 
minor adjustments to our postal delivery system, 
I hope my colleagues will carefully consider 
this legislation and then give it their support 
by signing on as co-sponsors. If America 
is to be truly competitive in the forthcoming 
era of computers and telecommunications, we 
simply cannot afford a correspondence delivery 
system that is neither prompt nor reliable. 
Instead, we need a system that is state of the 
art and the best way to get it is make use of, 
by making the USPS a part of, the private 
sector. 

ENDING THE FOREIGN AID 
PIPELINE MESS 

HON. TOBY ROTH 

OF WISCONSIN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. ROTH. Mr. Speaker, today I have introduced 
legislation to bring to an end a multibillion-
dollar problem with our foreign aid programs: 
the so-called foreign aid pipeline. The 
pipeline consists of funds appropriated in prior 
years, up to a decade ago, but which are not 
expended and just sit in accounts waiting for 
some bureaucrat to dream up a way to spend 
it. 

Responding to my request for an investigation 
in 1991, the General Accounting Office reported 
that nearly $9 billion has been sitting in 
the pipeline, for up to 10 years. GAO recommended 
that such unneeded funds be canceled 
after 2 years, with a couple of specific 
exceptions. 

In 1991, the House adopted my amendment 
to cut off this pipeline, but the underlying bill 
was not enacted. Again in 1993, a version of 
my amendment was incorporated into the Foreign 
Affairs Committee’s foreign aid reform 
bill, but that bill also was not enacted. 

Today, I am renewing my initiative to cut off 
this multibillion waste of taxpayers’ funds. 
GAO estimated that about half of the funds in 
the pipeline could be recovered by enacting 
my proposal, as much as $4.5 billion. My bill 
was drafted after consulting with experts at the 
GAO. 

At a time when Congress is debating reductions 
in programs for Americans, foreign aid 
should be cut first. The place to start cutting 
is in the foreign aid pipeline, because it has already 
been determined to be a source of 
waste. 

As the new Congress proceeds to considering 
legislation to make spending savings, I 
intend to seek action on this bill and end this 
misuse of taxpayers’ money.

USE OF UNDERUTILIZED BUILD


INGS IN ECONOMICALLY DE


PRESSED AREAS 

HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR. 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to reintroduce legislation that I sponsored in 
the 103d Congress that would require the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration to 
take advantage of abandoned and underutilized 
buildings and grounds in economically 
depressed areas of the country when selecting 
new site facilities. I invite all Members to cosponsor 
this legislation. 

I believe that in this age of reinvestment in 
our large cities, programs such as Enterprise 
Zone and HUD grants offer economically depressed 
communities the opportunity to pick 
themselves up and forge ahead with their recovery. 
I also believe, however, that Federal 
agencies, such as NASA, should look at those 
same communities when looking to expand 
their facilities. Much like a major sports team, 
NASA expansion into an economically depressed 
area would boost the area’s financial 

status, self-esteem, and morale. Often these 
last two simply cannot be fixed with a simple 
Government-sponsored grant. 

My legislation would also allow older buildings 
and underused facilities in decaying cities 
the chance to be fully utilized, thereby furthering 
the economic and cosmetic recovery of 
those cities. And because those facilities 
would already be in place, NASA would not 
have to spend a fortune on constructing all 
new buildings and support infrastructure. 

Mr. Speaker, NASA’s operations should not 
just be something we see pictures of on television. 
I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this 
legislation so that all Americans can take advantage 
of this country’s space program.

THE 103D CONGRESS 

HON. LEE H. HAMILTON 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
insert my Washington Report for Wednesday, 
October 19, 1994, into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. 

THE 103D CONGRESS 
The 103rd Congress promised to govern. In 
the end, despite significant achievements, it 
was unable to deliver on much of the legislative 
program. But it should not be judged 
solely on the numerous measures which were 
defeated in the closing weeks. Among them 
were the bills dealing with health care, campaign 
finance, lobbying disclosure, telecommunications, 
and toxic waste clean-up. 
There is no doubt it was a bad ending to the 
Congress. 
But the 103rd Congress really did quite a 
lot. It was reasonably productive even 
through extraordinarily contentious. In the 
end I think it was a respectable Congress, 
not spectacular but at least average. 
MEASURES PASSED 
Important legislation passed by the 103rd 
Congress included deficit reduction, the 
North American Free Trade Agreement, family 
and medical leave, ‘‘motor voter’’ registration, 
national service corps, Hatch Act 
revisions, the crime bill, interstate branch 
banking, Goals 2000 education reform, and 
deep cuts in the federal workforce. GATT 
may be added to this list during a special 
post-election session. It is easy to imagine 
another 8 to 12 pieces of major legislation 
that could have been passed near the end but 
were not. In judging the Congress it is important 
to think in terms of not only what it 
did but also what groundwork it laid. My 
guess is that basic agreements were reached 
in several areas in preparation for passage 
next year. That includes a telecommunications 
bill and superfund reform. 
The central achievement of the 103rd Congress 
was passage last year of one of the 
largest deficit reduction packages in history—
reducing the projected deficits over 
five years by some $430 billion. The deficit 
will fall three years in a row—the first time 
that has happened since the Truman Administration. 
This has helped boost the economy—
raising the overall growth rate, boosting 
productivity, and reducing the unemployment 
rate. Some 4.6 million new jobs 
have been created since January 1993, compared 
to 2.4 million over the previous four 
years. Passage of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement abolishing trade barriers 
between the United States, Mexico, and Canada 
has led to a sharp increase in U.S. exports 
to our NAFTA partners. 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E15 

Among the other achievements of the 103rd 
Congress were several education initiatives, 
including renewal of elementary and secondary 
education aid and expansion of Head 
Start, the Goals 2000 reform to set achievement 
standards, a school-to-work transition 
program, and an overhaul of the college student 
loan program. Two separate banking 
laws passed, one the remove restrictions on 
bank branches across state lines and another 
to put money for economic development into 
distressed areas via community development 
banks. The new crime package means more 
police on the street, more prisons, and 
tougher punishment for federal crimes. 

The reinventing government effort had 
some distinct successes; procurement reform 
to streamline government buying of goods 
and services and to allow more products to 
be purchased off the shelf, and buyouts to 
cut the federal payroll by almost 280,000 jobs 
over six years. Government reorganization 
advanced with the creation of a separate Social 
Security Administration and reorganization 
of the Agriculture Department. Congress 
renewed the independent counsel to investigate 
allegations against high ranking 
government officials. The most significant 
piece of environmental legislation passed 
was the California Desert Protection Act 
creating the largest wilderness area outside 
Alaska. 

DISAPPOINTMENTS 

A Congress, of course, is always measured 
against expectations. Looking just at what 
the 103rd Congress achieved, quite a lot was 
done. But looking at it against expectations 
and opportunities, it does not measure up 
very well. One standard by which Congress 
clearly failed was in gaining public confidence. 


As I wrote earlier, this Congress was a reform 
Congress and we learned once again 
that those who seek reform and change run 
into many obstacles and risk failure. 

I was disappointed that congressional reform, 
which included modest proposals for 
change made by the bi-partisan committee I 
co-chaired, died in both houses. These reform 
proposals will certainly be on the agenda for 
the 104th Congress. 

The most significant failure of the Congress 
was on health care reform. It died when 
consensus failed to develop among supporters 
of various plans. Welfare reform did 
not get out of committee. A campaign finance 
reform plan with voluntary spending 
limits and curbs on special interest money 
was killed by filibuster, as was a bill to ban 
lawmakers from accepting any gifts from 
lobbyists. 

I was disappointed that welfare reform was 
not enacted, but encouraged that in 1995 it 
will be high on the agenda of the 104th Congress. 
I was also disappointed that we could 
not strengthen the Clean Water Act and the 
Safe Drinking Water Act. 

It is especially difficult to move on reform 
when public confidence in government is 
waning and suspicion of its every act is rising. 
The public sees Congress as a do-nothing 
assembly of quarrelsome partisans more attuned 
to the special interests than to the 
voters. The large number of filibusters in the 
Senate certainly slowed the agenda. 

Many members of Congress believe the 
news media contributed to the very tough 
environment within which we do our work. 
The media tend to be more destructive than 
constructive, criticizing even those who are 
striving to make things better. One of my 
colleagues said that nothing about government 
is done as incompetently as the reporting 
of it. That may be an overstatement, but 
it is frustrating to see the failures of Congress 
celebrated while the very real successes 
are ignored. 

CONCLUSION 

Overall the 103rd Congress came out of the 
starting gate fast but it collapsed at the finish 
line. Some of the critics say that this 
was perhaps the worst Congress in 50 years. 
I simply do not agree. Those critics were too 
focused on the final days of the Congress and 
have not looked at the overall record. Certainly 
the final record could and should, 
have been better, but the 103rd Congress did 
manage to put together a list of significant 
accomplishments.

INTRODUCTION OF CAPITAL GAINS 
TAX PROPOSAL 

HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 

OF MASSACHUSETTS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, 
today I am introducing legislation, the Middle 
Class Income Tax Relief Act of 1995, which 
provides a capital gains tax cut for working 
class Americans. This legislation provides a 
lifetime capital gains bank of $200,000. Any 
taxpayer throughout the person’s lifetime 
would have a capital gains bank of $200,000. 
Under this legislation, a taxpayer could exclude 
up to 50 percent of the gain on the sale 
of a capital asset, up to the limit in the maximum 
tax rate of 19.8 percent. 

The benefit of lifetime capital gains tax bank 
would phase out as a taxpayer’s income increases 
above $200,000. Under this legislation 
individuals who sold stocks saved for retirement 
or a second home, or elderly individuals, 
who have a large gain in the sale of their 
principal residence, would benefit. The proposal 
includes a 3-year holding period for the 
capital asset. Short-term stock speculators 
would not be able to qualify for the benefit. 

In addition, the bill allows taxpayers to index 
the cost of real estate for inflation. An inflation-
induced gain is not a capital gain and should 
not be subject to tax. 

Lately, there has been much said about the 
necessity and benefits of a capital gain tax 
cut. A capital gains tax cut is a valid measure, 
but a capital gains tax needs to be economically 
feasible and to benefit the middle-class. 
A capital gains tax cut needs to be responsible. 
I believe the Middle Income Tax Relief 
Act of 1995 is an appropriate capital gains tax 
cut. 

Mr. Speaker, I insert a summary for the 
RECORD. 

SUMMARY OF MIDDLE INCOME TAX RELIEF ACT 

OF 1995 

Individuals would have a lifetime capital 
gains ‘‘bank’’. 

Bank limit would be $200,000 per person. 

All individuals would be entitled to the 
$200,000 bank: for example each spouse of a 
married couple would each have a separate 
limit. 

Any individual who sold a qualified asset 
could exclude up to 50% of the gain on the 
sale, up to the $200,000 limit. 

Qualified assets would include all capital 
assets under the present law, except collectibles. 


Under the bill, the maximum tax rate on 
capital gains income would be 19.8% (i.e. 1/2 
of the maximum 39.6% rate). 

The full benefit would be available in any 
year that a taxpayer had adjusted gross income 
in excess of $200,000. 

In the case of a sale or exchange of real 
property, taxpayers would be able to index 

their basis in the asset to the rate of inflation. 
Thus, no tax on inflation-induced gains. 

Example: taxpayer buys a house for $100,000 
and sells it 9 years later for $200,000. Inflation 
was 5% per year over the 9-year period. 
Basis for measuring gain is $145,000 so gain is 
$55,000. 

A 3-year holding period would apply so 
that the deduction would not be available to 
any taxpayer who held the asset for less than 
3 years.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ANAKTU-
VUK PASS LAND EXCHANGE AND 
WILDERNESS REDESIGNATION 
ACT OF 1994 

HON. DON YOUNG 

OF ALASKA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased today to introduce the Anaktuvuk 
Pass Land Exchange and Wilderness Redesignation 
Act of 1994. When enacted, this legislation 
will ratify an agreement to settle a longstanding 
and difficult dispute between the National 
Park Service and Alaska Native landowners 
over the use of all-terrain vehicles—or 
ATV’s for access for subsistence purposes in 
Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. 


The residents of Anaktuvuk Pass and the 
National Park Service have had a longstanding 
dispute over the use by village residents, 
of certain ATV’s for substance purposes 
on national park and wilderness lands 
adjacent to the village. In an effort to resolve 
this conflict, Arctic Slope Regional Corp.—the 
regional corporation established by the Inupiat 
Eskimo people of Alaska’s North Slope under 
the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act [ANCSA], Nunamuit Corp.—the 
Anaktuvuk Pass ANCSA Village Corp.—the 
city of Anaktuvuk Pass and the National Park 
Service have entered into an innovative agreement 
both guaranteeing dispersed ATV access 
on specific tracts of park land and limiting 
development of Native land in the area. 
The agreement will limit the types of ATV’s allowed 
and will also lead to enhanced recreational 
opportunities by improving public access 
across Native lands. 

The village of Anaktuvuk Pass is located on 
the North Slope of Alaska in the remote 
Brooks Mountain Range, completely within the 
boundary of and surrounded by the Gates of 
the Arctic National Park and Preserve. Village 
residents have long relied upon the use of 
ATV’s for summer access to subsistence resources, 
primarily caribou, on certain of these 
nearby park, and park wilderness lands. As 
there are no rivers near the community for 
motorboat access to park lands, ATC’s provide 
the primary means by which to reach and 
transport game in the summer. The only alternative 
to ATV use is to walk which is not feasible 
in these remote areas. Snowmobiles are 
the primary mode of transportation for subsistence 
activities in the winter. 

With the passage of the Alaska National Interest 
Lands Conservation Act [ANILCA] in 
1980, Congress expressly reserved the rights 
of rural Alaska residents to continued, reasonable 
access to subsistence resources on public 
lands, by providing in section 811(a) of that 
act, ‘‘rural residents engaged in subsistence 


E16 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 1995 

uses shall have reasonable access to subsistence 
resources on public lands.’’ Section 
811(b) of ANILCA provides further that ‘‘the 
Secretary shall permit on the public lands appropriate 
use for subsistence purposes of 
snowmobiles, motorboats, and other means of 
surface transportation traditionally employed 
for such purposes by local residents, subject 
to reasonable regulation.’’ The National Park 
Service and the Native landowners disagree 
about whether ATV’s are other means of surface 
transportation traditionally employed for 
subsistence purposes in Gates of the Arctic 
National Park and Preserve. But there is no 
dispute that ATV’s are necessary for the summertime 
subsistence activities of the residents 
of Anaktuvuk Pass. 

Following several years of discussions, the 
Native landowners and the National Park 
Service have reached an agreement which will 
finally resolve the ATV controversy on the 
public lands surrounding Anaktuvuk Pass. In 
April 1992, the Park Service issued a final legislative 
environmental impact statement embracing 
the proposed agreement, and in November 
1992, the Secretary of the Interior endorsed 
the agreement in a Record of Decision. 
The parties executed the agreement on 
December 17, 1992. 

The parties have since executed two technical 
amendments to the original agreement. 

The agreement involves an exchange of 
land and interests in lands between the Native 
landowners and the Park Service. Specifically, 
the Federal Government will convey in fee approximately 
30,642 acres of park land to Arctic 
Slop Regional Corp. and Nunamuit Corp. On 
the Federal land conveyed to the Native corporations, 
the National Park Service will reserve 
surface and subsurface access and development 
rights as well as broad public access 
easements. In addition, certain non-
wilderness areas of federally owned park land 
will be opened to dispersed ATV use. In return, 
the Native landowners will convey to the 
Federal Government approximately 38,840 
acres in fee for inclusion in both the national 
park and national wilderness systems. Native 
landowners will also convey to the Park Service 
additional surface and subsurface development 
rights on 86,307 acres as well as a series 
of conservation, scenic, and public access 
easements on other Native-owned lands within 
the boundaries of Gates of the Arctic National 
Park and Preserve. Finally, the city of 
Anaktuvuk Pass will convey a city lot to the 
National Park Service for administrative purposes. 


Congressional ratification of this agreement 
will be required in order to remove 73,993 
acres of Federal land from the National Wilderness 
Preservation System, as well as to 
designate approximately 56,825 acres of other 
park and presently Native-owned lands as 
new national wilderness. If ratified by Congress, 
the agreement will expressly authorize 
dispersed ATV use on certain lands within the 
park boundary. Without congressional approval, 
the agreement will become null and 
void, and none of the conveyances or creation 
of easements proposed by the agreement will 
occur. 

It is intended that this agreement will resolve 
the longstanding dispute over subsistence 
use of ATV’s only on public lands in and 
around Anaktuvuk Pass. It is important to note 
that neither this agreement nor the accompanying 
Federal legislation will diminish, or 

otherwise affect in any way, anyone’s rights 
and privileges to access public lands in Alaska 
for subsistence purposes. This agreement 
does not conform or deny that ATV access to 
public lands for subsistence use is a statutorily 
protected traditional access right under 
ANILCA, and consequently, this agreement 
does not purport to resolve this issue. 

As discussed previously, this legislation 
would remove 73,993 acres of wilderness from 
the park and designate 56,825 acres of new 
wilderness. Consistent with agreements 
reached during the 103d session, 13,168 
acres of wilderness will be designated along 
the Nigu River, adjacent to the park, hence, a 
no-net-loss, no-net-gain of wilderness in the 
area.

BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT 
AND LINE-ITEM VETO 

HON. BILL EMERSON 

OF MISSOURI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. EMERSON. Mr. Speaker, I am introducing 
two bills today to amend the Constitution 
to provide some budgetary common 
sense—one will require a balanced Federal 
budget; the other will provide line-item veto 
power for the President. 

I have long been a staunch supporter of a 
balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
I have cosponsored the balanced budget 
amendment since I came to Congress, but 
until recently, the amendment was blocked by 
its opponents. 

In 1992, the balanced budget amendment 
fell just nine votes short of the two-thirds majority 
needed for passage. In the 103d Congress, 
I was disappointed to see that both the 
House and the Senate rejected the balanced 
budget amendment. Some Members of the 
Congress continue to oppose the balanced 
budget amendment, claiming that Congress 
needs fiscal discipline now instead of in the future. 
I agree with part of that statement wholeheartedly: 
Congress does need fiscal discipline 
now. It should be obvious to all, however, 
that with deficits for 30 of the last 31 
years, Congress simply has not had that discipline. 


I will continue to push for passage of the 
balanced budget amendment. A constitutional 
amendment is no substitute for direct action 
on the part of Congress. However, we have 
seen time and time again that Congress does 
not have the ability to provide that action, and 
we need this enforcement mechanism. While I 
share individuals’ concerns about social security 
and other vital programs, I believe Congress 
needs this fiscal tool to ensure budget 
discipline. It is time to just say no—and mean 
it—to the tax-and-spend policies that have gotten 
the Federal Government into this mess to 
begin with. 

My rationale for introducing a line-item veto 
resolution is similar. As long as Congress continues 
to send the President jam-packed, all-
encompassing spending bills, the President 
must often choose between signing unnecessary 
spending into law on one hand and shutting 
down the Federal Government on the 
other. A General Accounting Office [GAO] report 
estimated that if the President had line-
item veto authority from 1984 through 1989, 

the savings would have ranged anywhere from 
$7 billion to $17 billion per year. 

In the 103d Congress, the House passed an 
expedited rescission bill which would force an 
up-or-down vote on a presidential rescissions 
package. I voted for this bill—it’s a far cry from 
the true line-item veto, but it is a step in the 
right direction. We need to encourage fiscal 
responsibility in the Congress. 

I urge support and passage of both of these 
important fiscal accountability bills early in the 
104th Congress. The time is right for this legislation 
to finally come to fruition.

LIMIT CONGRESSIONAL TERMS 

HON. BOB STUMP 

OF ARIZONA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. STUMP. Mr. Speaker, last November, 
citizens across the country sent a strong message 
to the Congress that they will no longer 
tolerate business-as-usual on Capitol Hill. This 
resulted in a new Congress that has already 
begun to demonstrate that it will deliver the reforms 
Americans have asked for and justly deserve. 
I am proud to be a part of this new, reform-
minded body. 

One of the reforms that is foremost on the 
minds of Americans is congressional term limits. 
They are tired, and rightly so, of career 
politicians who are more concerned with their 
reelection campaigns than advancing a legislative 
agenda that is in the Nation’s best interests. 


Under the current system of unlimited 2-
year terms, no sooner are lawmakers elected 
to office before they are gearing up for the 
next campaign. This is no way to promote 
good government, and only contributes to the 
malfunctioning legislative process. Moreover, it 
is fiscally unsound. There is compelling evidence 
that the longer Congressmen stay in 
Washington, the more likely they are to support 
big spending programs, regardless of the 
public desire for budget cuts. 

In an effort to reverse this damaging trend, 
I am today introducing a resolution proposing 
that our Constitution be amended to limit 
Members of Congress to three 4-year terms. 
Under the system of limited terms I am offering, 
we would have a body of noncareer legislators 
who know that their stay in Washington 
is temporary. They would not be constantly 
dogged by reelection concerns and would be 
able to devote more time and attention to their 
legislative responsibilities and make the tough 
budget-cutting decisions that are desperately 
needed. This would go a long way toward restoring 
integrity and fiscal responsibility to the 
Congress. 

Mr. Speaker, when the Constitution was 
drafted, the Framers did not contemplate people 
making a career of politics, and history 
shows that they anticipated a good deal of 
turnover in Congress. I, therefore, urge my 
colleagues to join me in this effort to return the 
House to the body of citizen legislators that 
our Founding Fathers envisioned.

NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL 

WEATHER INFORMATION SYS


TEMS ACT IMPROVEMENTS 

HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR. 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, last year I introduced 
legislation H.R. 1016, which would 
amend the National Agriculture Weather Information 
Systems Act of 1990 to improve the 
collection and distribution of weather information 
to assist agricultural producers. Today, I 
am again introducing this bill, and I urge all 
Members to cosponsor this important legislation. 


The 1990 farm bill established the National 
Agricultural Weather Information System under 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture to meet the 
weather and climate information needs of agricultural 
producers. I believe that the program 
is vital because it collects and organizes 
weather information from universities, State 
programs, Federal agencies and the private 
weather consulting sector. Moreover, it provides 
funding for weather research programs. 

However, it provides for the establishment 
of only 10 State agricultural weather information 
systems that are responsible for disseminating 
information to agricultural producers in 
those States. That leaves a large portion of 
this Nation’s agricultural producers without any 
assistance. 

Mr. Speaker, my legislation fills the gaps left 
by present law by requiring the Secretary of 
Agriculture to enter into an agreement with the 
Secretary of Commerce to use Weather Service 
offices and Weather Service forecast offices 
to collect, organize, and distribute information 
aimed at meeting the short-term and 
long-term weather and climate information 
needs of agricultural producers. Each field office 
of the National Weather Service will be responsible 
for collecting and organizing information 
that will impact the region that it covers. 


H.R. 1016 will provide agricultural producers 
throughout the Nation with comprehensive and 
timely information. Weather information is central 
to agricultural producers across the Nation 
because variations in weather conditions can 
cause huge losses in production. My legislation 
will reduce the risk of profit loss. 
Once again, Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members 
to cosponsor this important legislation.

INTRODUCTION OF THE STATE 

MARITIME ACADEMY LICENSING 

RELIEF ACT 

HON. JACK FIELDS 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. FIELDS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to introduce today a bill to provide relief 
to the young men and women who attend 
our State maritime academies: Texas A&M 
University at Galveston, the California Maritime 
Academy, the Great Lakes Regional Maritime 
Academy, the Maine Maritime Academy, 
the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, and 
the New York Maritime Academy. 

These academies educate and train licensed 
officers for service during war and 

peace in the maritime industry, the Navy, the 
Coast Guard, and the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration. Unlike students 
enrolled at the national service academies, cadets 
at our six State maritime academies pay 
their own tuition and fees for their education, 
including training cruises and naval science 
courses. In addition, their academic year lasts 
11 months, which deprives them of the opportunity 
for summer employment. In order to get 
a maritime job, graduates have to take and 
pass examinations for a license as an engine 
or deck officer. 

Regrettably, in 1990, the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act—Public Law 101–508—removed 
longstanding prohibitions against the 
collection of fees or charges for these examinations 
and licenses. While I oppose any fee 
or charge for the issuance of a maritime license, 
I am particularly distressed that there 
are no exemptions from these fees, and that 
they even apply to cadets graduating from our 
State maritime academies. In response to that 
act, the Coast Guard has imposed a number 
of new fees requiring these fine young men 
and women to pay up to $500 to obtain their 
licenses and merchant mariner documents. 

Mr. Speaker, State maritime academy cadets, 
who normally take a licensing examination 
within 3 months of graduation, do not 
have the financial resources to pay these fees. 
They have just completed 4 years of college, 
have spent thousands of dollars on college expenses, 
and have yet to earn a penny in their 
chosen profession. The fees place a heavy 
burden on cadets at a time when they can 
least afford it. These fees are a disincentive to 
those contemplating a career in the U.S. maritime 
industry and they are patently unfair, in 
that other transportation professionals, like airline 
pilots and railroad engineers, are not required 
to pay licensing or examination fees. 

These fees will do little to reduce our Federal 
deficit; they will cause tremendous pain 
for our State maritime academy graduates; 
and they will further strain the U.S. merchant 
marine industry, which is struggling for its survival. 


Superintendents at the State academies 
strongly recommend that the user fees for licenses 
be repealed for all cadets taking an 
entry level examination. These superintendents 
have previously testified during congressional 
hearings that ‘‘it is unconscionable to 
mandate to young men and women who pay 
for an education which clearly supports our 
national security to take and pass a licensing 
exam, and then charge them a fee to take it. 
In essence, the user fee is a graduation tax 
which is exorbitant in relation to an entry level 
cadet’s income history.’’ 

While my preference would be to either repeal 
these onerous fees or waive them for 
first-time recipients, unfortunately, the Congressional 
Budget Office has indicated that either 
approach would create a pay-as-you-go 
[PAYGO] budget problem. Since I am not interested 
in increasing anyone’s tax burden, I 
have decided to solve this problem in a different 
way. 

Under my bill, our six State maritime academies 
would each receive a portion of a 
$300,000 authorization to pay any Cost Guard 
user fees associated with the cost of a cadet 
obtaining an original license and merchant 
mariner document. Furthermore, this reimbursement 
system would only be activated 
when Congress appropriates the additional 

money required to satisfy this purpose. Until 
that occurs, State maritime cadets will have to 
pay their own fees. In this way, Congress can 
ease the financial burden on these maritime 
cadets without forcing their academies to reduce 
funding for vital training or educational 
programs. 

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join 
me in support of the State Maritime Academy 
Licensing Relief Act.

JOB TRAINING 

HON. LEE H. HAMILTON 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
insert my Washington Report for Wednesday, 
January 4, 1995 into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. 

JOB TRAINING 
An important challenge for the nation is to 
equip American workers with the skills and 
training necessary to find jobs in today’s 
labor force. In talking with employers in Indiana, 
I am constantly impressed with the 
mismatch between the skills Hoosiers have 
and the skills managers require. Many workers 
have skills, but not the right skills that 
high technology companies require to compete 
globally. The problem is how you move 
a work force suited to one type of economy 
into a world that demands different skills. 

PRIVATE SECTOR TRAINING 

The private sector has taken the lead on 
training and retraining the work force. Such 
efforts vary from firm to firm, but tend to 
predominate in larger companies. Corporate 
restructuring has reassigned responsibility 
from upper management to workers and supervisors, 
increasing the need for management 
and team-based skills at these levels. 
Companies have recognized that survival in 
the global marketplace requires a flexible 
work force with diverse skills and adaptability 
to new work routines and environments. 
On average, employers spend about 
2% of their payroll on training. 

The skills that are needed in the workplace 
are fairly well agreed upon. Workers need 
the ability to develop work schedules, budget 
money and assign staff. They require interpersonal 
skills. They need to know how to 
use computers to gather and process information. 
They must understand how their 
own work fits into the work around them so 
that they can solve problems. They also need 
to deal with new technologies in an 
everchanging workplace. 

None of these skills replaces the needed 
proficiency in the basics: reading, writing 
and arithmetic. Without those basic skills, 
the other skills would be of little value. The 
important thing is that the education system 
produce learners, not knowers. Workers 
need to demonstrate a mastery of skills 
more than the accumulation of a body of 
knowledge. 

FEDERAL PROGRAMS 

The federal government runs a number of 
training programs to help complement private 
sector efforts, but many of those programs 
have had a mixed record of success. 
The federal government spent about $25 billion 
last year on more than 150 employment 
and training programs administered by 14 
agencies. Many of these programs are small 
and receive limited funding, and most are 
managed in cooperation with state governments. 
In Indiana, for example, the Indiana 


E18 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 1995 

Department of Workplace Development runs 
many retraining programs through local private 
industry councils. 

Federal education and training programs 
concentrate on two types of persons. Disadvantaged 
workers lack the basic skills to 
function in the labor force or to acquire education 
and training. Programs for these persons 
concentrate on providing skills and education 
that will enable them to participate 
in the work force and become self-sufficient. 
Some programs provide remedial training; 
others, adult literacy and vocational training. 


Dislocated workers have the skills to participate 
in the work force, but have become 
temporarily unemployed. These workers may 
require retraining to find new jobs. Workers 
who become dislocated through federal policies, 
such as trade agreements, environmental 
regulation or defense downsizing are 
eligible for federally funded job training. 

REFORMS 
Congress has already taken some steps to 
improve the current system. It has funded 
local ‘‘one stop’’ career centers where workers 
can obtain information on training programs 
and employment opportunities. It has 
also created School-to-Work transition programs 
that will assist young persons in making 
the transition from school to full-time 
employment. 
However, more dramatic reforms are likely 
to be considered this year. We need to consolidate 
our present array of federal job 
training programs in a manner that enhances 
worker participation and productivity. 
These programs should be structured 
to make information and resources more 
available to the intended recipients. One approach 
would be to consolidate existing programs 
into a single federal program and give 
state governments more flexibility in administering 
retraining efforts. A second approach 
involves providing ‘‘skill scholarships’’, 
student loans, and tax credits to 
those who are in need of training and education. 
Financial resources would be placed 
directly in the hands of those who seek to 
improve their skills. 
CONCLUSION 
Most studies show that the benefits of federal 
retraining efforts are modest, especially 
in the programs for severely disadvantaged 
workers. It has become very clear that you 
cannot make up for the deficits of a lifetime 
in a few months of training. We may get better 
results from programs with one or two 
years of intense training. 
I am inclined to think that the main focus 
of our efforts should be on mainstream 
young people who are not going on to four 
year college. The approach would direct such 
youth into community colleges and technical 
programs to upgrade their basic skills 
and to learn other skills needed in growing 
areas. Our country does a lot for people who 
go to college. We do considerably less for 
people who do not. They are the forgotten 
half. They are also largely the people who 
build homes, fix appliances, repair roads, answer 
telephones and work in factories. 
Of course, the great flaw in the training 
programs is simple: many trainees cannot 
find jobs. One approach to alleviate this program 
may be for government to provide 
training funds to employers who have jobs 
but cannot find suitable workers. This approach 
sidesteps expensive and fruitless job 
searches. Employers, under this approach, 
would guarantee jobs to those who complete 
training successfully. 
The nation’s challenge is to create a system 
of worker training that will train a 
highly skilled and educated work force, 
boost our nation’s productivity, and meet 
the economic challenges from abroad. Our 

society must adopt a philosophy of life-long 
learning and training for workers. Without 
well-trained workers, this country will become 
a second-rate economy.

INTRODUCTION OF THE EQUAL 
REMEDIES ACT 

HON. BARBARA B. KENNELLY 

OF CONNECTICUT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mrs. KENNELLY. Mr. Speaker, today I am 
introducing legislation to correct a serious inequity 
in civil rights legislation, created by the 
passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. While 
that bill represented significant progress in the 
ongoing battle to overcome discrimination, it 
also created a two-tiered system of justice. 

Under the current law, victims of intentional 
racial discrimination are entitled to unlimited 
damages. However, victims of discrimination 
based on disability, sex or religion can receive 
damages only up to a statutory maximum. 
Just as I strongly support the right to seek unlimited 
damages for racial discrimination, I 
also support this redress for victims of other 
types of discrimination as well. 

That is why I am introducing the Equal 
Remedies Act of 1995. This bill would eliminate 
caps on damages set by the Civil Rights 
Act of 1991 and send the strong message that 
discrimination of any kind cannot be tolerated 
by our society. It is time to make all victims of 
discrimination equal under the law—second-
class remedies have no place in anti-discrimination 
law. 

I urge all my colleagues to support this important 
legislation.

CAPITAL GAINS—CREATING JOBS 
AND TREASURY REVENUE 

HON. PHILIP M. CRANE 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, when I first ran 
for Congress in a 1969 special election, the 
overriding theme of my candidacy at that time 
and the theme of my candidacy ever since, 
centered on fiscal responsibility—less spending 
and lower taxes. Although I was not initially 
able to serve on a committee directly 
dealing with tax or budget issues, in the 94th 
Congress, 1975–1976, I was honored with an 
appointment to the Committee on Ways and 
Means, the committee with jurisdiction over all 
tax matters that came before Congress. I have 
served on that committee ever since. 

In the years prior to my service in Congress, 
it had become clear to me that lower taxes 
stimulate economic growth, and this was certainly 
the case with regard to the taxation of 
capital gains. From the day I began serving in 
Congress I have pushed to reduce the rate of 
tax on capital. In the time I have served on the 
committee, we have reduced the capital gains 
rate twice, only to see the rate hiked back up 
through the enactment of the Tax Reform Act 
of 1986. In 1989, we came close to again 
bringing the rate back down, actually passing 
a reduction in the House, only to see the legislation 
die in the Senate. Now, with a new 

Republican majority in Congress and the Republican 
Contract With America, we have another 
opportunity to reduce the capital gains 
rate. 

Over the years I have sponsored, cosponsored, 
and supported many different capital 
gains proposals. Indeed, I am an original cosponsor 
of the contract’s capital gains proposal 
offered by my long-time colleague and 
good friend, the new chairman of the Ways 
and Means Committee, BILL ARCHER. In addition, 
to cosponsoring Chairman ARCHER’s legislation, 
however, I wanted to again introduce 
my own legislation to this Congress, not only 
to highlight my long-standing commitment to 
this issue, but to raise the matter of the appropriate 
rate of taxation for capital gains. 

In the next months, the Ways and Means 
Committee will be holding a series of hearings 
that will include debate and discussion of a 
capital gains rate reduction. We will discuss 
indexation of capital gains—something I believe 
is absolutely critical—the period of time 
which capital must be held to qualify, and we 
will discuss the rate at which capital gains 
ought to be taxed. 

Frankly, I would love to see capital gains 
taxes eliminated altogether. Moreover, I believe 
any reduction in the rate will be beneficial 
to all Americans. However, if your intention 
is to greatly stimulate capital investment 
while at the same time maximize revenues to 
the Treasury, experts suggest that the capital 
gains rate should be set somewhat between 
12–15 percent. The legislation I am introducing 
today would provide for a maximum 
capital gains rate of 15 percent for all brackets 
except for those in the lowest bracket, where 
the rate would be 7.5 percent. 

I would be remiss in closing this statement 
without making some additional comments 
with regard to the benefits of reducing the 
capital gains rate. First, all Americans will benefit 
from a reduction in capital gains tax, not 
just the rich. It is flat out wrong to state that 
only rich people will benefit from such a tax 
cut. Indeed, the last time we seriously debated 
the issue in 1989, Treasury Department statistics 
showed that almost 75 percent of those 
families/individuals filing tax returns which reported 
capital gains had incomes of less than 
$50,000, hardly the rich. 

Moreover, when the capital gains rate is reduced, 
not only does money flow more freely 
between capital investments but more money 
is invested in capital. Both of these consequences 
are highly beneficial, and the net 
result of more investment is more jobs. The 
small businessman who is taking a risk starting 
a new business will find it easier to attract 
investors to share that risk because the penalty 
for success has been reduced. Moreover, 
because a larger pool of money will become 
available for capital investment due to a reduced 
capital gains tax rate, the cost of that 
capital to businesses will go down. 

Another point that must be mentioned concerns 
how the change in the capital gains rate 
affects revenues to the Treasury—not a small 
issue in our dire budgetary circumstances. 
Critics of capital gains rate reductions have always 
tried to suggest that a reduction in the 
capital gains rate will mean a reduction in revenue 
to the Treasury. Nothing could be further 
from the truth. In reality, the past two times we 
have reduced the capital gains rate, revenues 
to the Treasury attributed to capital gains have 
actually increased. This happens because of 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E19 

the consequences I just mentioned. When the 
rate is lower, more money flows to capital and 
between capital assets. Thus, you have more 
capital gain transactions and it is the transaction 
which triggers the tax. Moreover, the 
economic growth generated by more available 
and cheaper capital creates jobs, which 
means more taxpayers. 

The vast majority of major industrialized 
countries in this world already know these 
benefits and their capital gains rates are significantly 
lower than the current rate in the 
United States. It is time that the United States 
got smart and caught up with the rest of the 
world. I look forward to a productive debate on 
the capital gains issue in the Ways and Means 
Committee and hope that our committee’s 
capital gains initiative, in whatever final form it 
takes, passes both the House and the Senate 
and is signed into law by the President.

ROCKLAND COUNTY MEDIAN 
INCOME BILL, H.R. 21 

HON. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. GILMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce 
H.R. 21, legislation to correct the median 
income calculation for Rockland County, NY. 

Currently, Rockland County’s median income 
is calculated by the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development [HUD] as 
part of the primary metropolitan statistical area 
[PMSA], which includes all of the income data 
for New York City. For this reason, HUD lists 
Rockland County’s median income for a family 
of four as $40,500. The 1990 census shows 
that the county’s true median income to be 
$60,479, a difference of approximately 
$20,000. 

Since HUD’s income levels are used in calculating 
eligibility for almost all State and Federal 
housing programs, these inaccurate statistics 
severely limit the access of Rockland 
County residents to many beneficial programs. 
Income caps for the State of New York mortgage 
agency, Fanny Mae/Freddie Mac, HUD’s 
section 8, and a myriad of other beneficial programs 
are artificially low, thus most of Rockland’s 
residents, financial institutions, sellers, 
and home builders are at a severe disadvantage 
compared to their counterparts in neighboring 
counties, whose statistics accurately reflect 
their population. 

During the 103d Congress I was successful 
in gaining the inclusion of this important bill’s 
language in H.R. 3838, the Housing and Community 
Development Act. Unfortunately, 
though this legislation was approved by the 
House of Representatives the Senate chose 
not to act. 

Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support 
this median income bill as well as the 104th 
Congress’ attempt to enact a major housing 
bill. 

At this point in the RECORD, I request that 
the full text of my bill be inserted in the 
RECORD: 

H.R. 21 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DETERMINATION OF INCOME LIMITS. 

That section 3(b)(2) of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2)) is 
amended— 

(1) in the 4th sentence— 
(A) by striking ‘‘County’’ and inserting 
‘‘and Rockland Counties’’; and 
(B) by inserting ‘‘each’’ before ‘‘such county’’; 
and 
(2) in the last sentence— 
(A) by striking ‘‘County’’ the 1st place it 
appears and inserting ‘‘or Rockland Counties’’; 
and 
(B) by striking ‘‘County’’ the 2d place it 
appears and inserting ‘‘and Rockland Counties’’.

The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 
shall issue regulations implementing 
the amendments made by section 1 not later 
than the expiration of the 90-day period beginning

Act. The regulations may not take effect

HEALTH INSURANCE EQUITY ACT 
OF 1995 

HON. BLANCHE LAMBERT LINCOLN 

OF ARIZONA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
re-introduce a bill that will make health insurance 
premiums more affordable for farmers 
and self-employed individuals. The Health Insurance 
Equity Act of 1995 simply changes 
the tax code to permanently provide the self-
employed with a 100-percent tax deduction for 
costs incurred while purchasing health insurance. 
This legislation will also be retroactive to 
the previous tax year beginning January 1, 
1994, when the 25-percent deduction expired. 
Let me be clear, this legislation gives the self-
employed the 100-percent deduction now, and 
extends it to last year. 

It is time to face the facts about purchasing 
health coverage today. Many of the 37 million 
uninsured are small business owners. Health 
care costs averaged $3,160 per person in 
1992, with current increases projected to run 
in double digits through the end of the century. 
Prescription drug costs in many cases have 
risen more than 60 percent since 1985. My 
constituents are asking for relief. 

This bill achieves our goals of health care 
cost reduction and better access for the uninsured 
while reducing costs for those currently 
insured through lowering fees passed onto 
consumers from hospitals for care of the uninsured. 
Adoption of this proposal may even encourage 
employers to purchase better health 
care plans for their employees. 

Our actions must show our constituents that 
we understand the problems they are facing. 
This legislation achieves 100-percent deductibility 
immediately without any phasein. Tax relief 
and tax fairness are what this legislation is 
all about, and tax relief and tax fairness are 
what the Health Insurance Equity Act of 1995 
is promoting. While this legislation is not the 
final solution to our health care ills, it is a necessary 
first step in providing assistance to the 
small businessmen and farmers who are the 
economic backbone of my district, my State, 
and our economy. 

DOD ASSISTANCE IN BORDER 
PROTECTION FUNCTION 

HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR. 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to reintroduce legislation that would authorize 
the Secretary of Defense to assign up to 
10,000 full-time Department of Defense [DOD] 
personnel to assist the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service [INS] and the U.S. Customs 
Service in performing their border protection 
functions. This legislation is identical to H.R. 
1017, which I introduced in the 103d Congress. 
I am urging my colleagues to become 
co-sponsors of this legislation. 

The Border Patrol has the strength of only 
3,800, yet its mission is to guard the two longest 
borders of one of the largest countries of 
the world. Reports indicate that, at any given 
time, only 800 patrolmen are available to protect 
our 2,000-mile southern border. 

The people of this country have shown that 
they are becoming increasingly impatient with 
Congress’s inaction toward illegal immigration. 
In California alone, voters in November approved 
a State referendum that would discontinue 
nearly all State social benefits for illegal 
immigrants. While there is heated debate 
on both sides of this issue concerning its constitutional 
and moral grounds, the problem 
would not even exist if a stronger Border Patrol 
existed to monitor illegal crossings. Yet 
Congress has failed to provide funding necessary 
to enlarge the Border Patrol. Until Congress 
can find the money, this military option 
is the best short-term way to address this 
shortage of Border Patrol personnel. Until our 
borders are fully protected, illegal immigrants, 
drug traffickers, and possible terrorists will 
have an open invitation to cross into the 
United States undetected. 

DOD personnel are already involved in 
some border protection work. Yet, in terms of 
numbers, their involvement is virtually insignificant. 
My new bill would permit the Secretary 
of Defense to beef up the border with DOD 
personnel so that our borders are fully protected. 


We have hundreds of thousands of U.S. 
troops deployed throughout the world protecting 
European, Asian, and Latin American 
nations. At the same time, we have approximately 
three million illegal aliens crossing our 
border annually, carrying drugs into our Nation 
and taking jobs away from Americans that 
need them. If the DOD can bestow hundreds 
of thousands of U.S. troops on foreign nations 
for their defense, it should be able to spare 
about 10,000 military personnel to protect our 
Nation. 

Once again, I urge all Members to become 
cosponsors of this important legislation.

VOLUNTARY SCHOOL PRAYER 

HON. BILL EMERSON 

OF MISSOURI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. EMERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
introduce a constitutional amendment to allow 


E20 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 1995 

for voluntary school prayer. The Founding Fathers 
intended religion to provide a moral anchor 
for our democracy. Wouldn’t they be puzzled 
to return to modern-day America and find, 
among elite circles in academia and the 
media, a scorn for the public expression of religious 
values. I find it ironic that while taxpayer’s 
dollars are being used by bureaucrats 
to distribute condoms in our public schools 
across America, our children are prohibited 
from reading the Bible or offering voluntary 
prayer in public schools. This sends a powerful 
message to our children—and it is the 
wrong message. 

One of the many liberties our forefathers 
founded this great Nation upon was freedom 
of religion; a freedom to pray to the God we 
want, when we want, and where we want. Unfortunately, 
this freedom has been eroded by 
the Supreme Court over the last few decades. 
I firmly believe that no one should be forced 
to pray, especially if a certain prayer is contrary 
to an individual’s beliefs. But, there can 
be no question that every American citizen 
has the right to pray voluntarily whenever and 
wherever he or she chooses, and that includes 
children in public schools. This is protected 
under the first amendment; ‘‘Congress 
shall make no law respecting an establishment 
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise 
thereof.’’ It is that second part that I ask you 
to pay special attention to today. 

As President Reagan so eloquently stated in 
1982, ‘‘the First Amendment of the Constitution 
was not written to protect the people of 
this country from religious values; it was written 
to protect religious values from government 
tyranny.’’

SOURCE TAX LEGISLATION 

HON. BOB STUMP 

OF ARIZONA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. STUMP. Mr. Speaker, today I reintroduce 
legislation to prohibit State governments 
from taxing the pension income of people who 
reside in other States. 

The so-called source tax has become a 
major cause of anger and concern among retirees 
in Arizona and other States. Many of 
these retirees are being forced to pay income 
tax to States in which they no longer live, nor 
have lived for many years. 

In my opinion, the authority of California and 
other source tax States to tax Arizona residents 
merely because those residents may at 
one time have lived in those States and were 
covered by a pension plan, is dubious at best. 
The legislation I am introducing today would 
make clear that one State cannot tax the pensions 
of people who live in another. It is my 
belief and the belief of my constituents, that if 
source tax States need to raise revenue, they 
should do so from their own residents—not 
from people who cannot respond at the ballot 
box. 

REFORMING THE HOUSE 

HON. LEE H. HAMILTON 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
insert my Washington Report for Wednesday, 
December 28, 1994 into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. 

REFORMING THE HOUSE 
In early January, the House of Representatives 
will consider and likely pass the most 
significant reforms of its internal operations 
in decades. These changes were proposed by 
the new leadership, but many are drawn 
from the reform plan of last session’s Joint 
Committee on the Organization of Congress. 
More generally, the reforms continue a 
tradition of institutional renewal, dating 
from the mid-1970s, which aims to open up 
congressional deliberations, increase the authority 
of party leaders, and make the House 
leadership more accountable to rank-and-file 
Members of Congress and the public. My 
sense is that most of the new reforms are 
constructive, and will lead to meaningful improvements 
in the way business is conducted 
in the House. 

JOINT COMMITTEE REFORMS 

Many of the reforms in this package were 
derived from the work of the Joint Committee 
on the Organization of Congress, a bicameral 
and bipartisan panel which I co-
chaired. The Joint Committee made its recommendations 
for reform in November 1993, 
and last year the House did pass one of its 
major recommendations—requiring Congress 
to live under the same laws it applies to the 
private sector. 

Unfortunately, the remainder of the Joint 
Committee’s reform plan was not considered 
by the full House during the 103rd Congress. 
But the new House leadership has adopted or 
built on many of the key reform recommendations: 
First, again require the application 
of private sector laws to Congress. 
It is critical that Members of Congress follow 
the laws they pass for private citizens. 
Second, streamline the bloated congressional 
committee system, by reducing the total 
number of committees and restricting the 
number of committee assignments Members 
can have. The leadership also adopted a 
Joint Committee proposal to significantly 
reduce the number of subcommittees. Third, 
cut congressional staff. The leadership has 
proposed a one-third reduction in committee 
staff. It recommended no reduction in Members’ 
personal staff or in large congressional 
support agencies such as the General Accounting 
Office. The Joint Committee recommended 
a reduction in the entire legislative 
branch of up to 12%. Fourth, open up 
Congress to enhanced public scrutiny by publishing 
committee attendance and roll call 
votes, requiring that the Congressional 
Record be a verbatim account of congressional 
proceedings, and requiring that special 
interest projects included in spending 
bills be publicized, thus providing additional 
barriers to wasteful spending. 

ADDITIONAL REFORMS 

The new leadership has also proposed 
changes that were not included in the Joint 
Committee package, some of which are constructive, 
others of which are problematic. 
For example, to streamline the House it has 
proposed that three standing committees be 
abolished. The Joint Committee adopted a 
more flexible, ‘‘attrition’’ approach to committee 
abolition, providing incentives for 
Members to leave less important committees 
through strict assignment limitations and a 

requirement that committees losing one half 
of their members be considered for abolition. 
The basic approach of the leadership proposal 
should modestly improve the committee 
system, but it does not address the 
fundamental problem of several committees 
having huge jurisdictions. 

Drawing on the proposals of an earlier reform 
commission, the leadership would create 
a new chief administrative officer for the 
House who would be responsible for managing 
its non-legislative functions. I support 
this attempt to reduce patronage. But the 
leadership has made the chief administrative 
officer a partisan position, appointed and supervised 
by the Speaker. Instead, the administrative 
functions of Congress should be 
handled in a bipartisan fashion, with the 
chief administrative officer reporting to 
leaders from both parties. 

Another proposal would require a three-
fifths ‘‘supermajority’’ in the House to increase 
income tax rates. However, almost all 
substantive issues in the House are now settled 
by majority rule, and it is unclear why 
a three-fifths vote is appropriate for revenue 
matters but not for other legislation. If such 
supermajorities proliferate in the House, the 
result would be more legislative gridlock in 
Washington. In addition, the constitutionality 
of this proposal is in question. 

REFORM OMISSIONS 

From my viewpoint, a number of important 
reform recommendations in the Joint 
Committee plan are not included in the proposals 
made by the new leadership. I intend 
to work for the passage of these reforms during 
the 104th Congress. Among the omitted 
recommendations are proposals to: First, include 
private citizens in the ethics process in 
a meaningful way. The Joint Committee proposed 
that private citizens investigate ethics 
complaints against Members of the House, 
but major ethics reforms are not included in 
the package under consideration. 

Second, publicize the special interest tax 
breaks included in revenue bills and the 
budget resolution. My sense is that special 
interest loopholes should be treated the 
same as special interest spending projects. 
Such items should not be hidden from the 
public in huge bills. Third, streamline the 
budget process by shifting if from an annual 
to a biennial cycle, reducing redundant decisions 
and allowing more time for oversight. 

CONCLUSION 

The new House leadership has made a good 
start toward the passage of meaningful congressional 
reform. Their efforts have been 
assisted by the work of prior reform commissions, 
as well as the public demand for 
change and the transition to a new leadership 
with less invested in the institutional 
status quo. I intend to introduce and push 
for additional reforms aimed at making the 
House more efficient and publicly accountable. 
Reform is an on-going process. And reform 
is no panacea—many difficult issues are 
on the agenda. But sustained and meaningful 
institutional change is crucial for the restoration 
of public confidence in Congress.

INTRODUCTION OF POLICE AND 

FIREFIGHTERS TAX CLARIFICA


TION 

HON. BARBARA B. KENNELLY 

OF CONNECTICUT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mrs. KENNELLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce legislation that is of vital interest 
to police and firefighters in Connecticut. 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E21 

This legislation would simply clear up a situation 
where erroneous State law has caused 
benefits that were intended to be treated as 
workmen’s compensation to be brought into 
income on audit. In several States, including 
Connecticut, the State law providing these 
benefits for police and firefighters included an 
irrebuttable presumption that heart and hypertension 
conditions were the result of hazardous 
work conditions. 

In Connecticut the State law has been corrected 
so that while there is a presumption 
that such conditions are the result of hazardous 
work, the State or municipality involved 
could require medical proof. This change satisfies 
the IRS definition of workmen’s compensation. 
Therefore, all this legislation would 
do is exempt from income those payments received 
by these individuals as a result of faulty 
State law but only for the past 3 years—1989, 
1990 and 1991. From January 1, 1992 forward 
those already receiving these benefits would 
have to meet the standard IRS test. 

The importance of this legislation is that 
these individuals believed that they followed 
State law. The cities and towns involved believed 
that they followed State law and therefore 
all parties involved believed that these 
benefits were not subject to tax. However, the 
IRS currently has an audit project ongoing in 
Connecticut and has deemed these benefits 
taxable. All this legislation says is that all parties 
involved made a good faith effort to comply 
with what they thought the law was. The 
State was in error. That error has been rectified 
but those individuals on disability should 
not be required to pay 3 years back taxes plus 
interest and penalties. 

This legislation has passed the House previously. 
It was included in H.R. 11, the Revenue 
Act of 1992 which was subsequently vetoed 
by President Bush. I hope that the 104th 
Congress can act expeditiously on this important 
legislation.

BASE AND CANAL RIGHTS IN 
PANAMA POST 2000 

HON. PHILIP M. CRANE 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. CRANE. Mr. Speaker, 80 years ago, the 
United States completed construction of one 
of the engineering marvels of its or any age, 
a multilock, 51-mile-long interoceanic ship 
canal across the Isthmus of Panama. Since 
then, this manmade waterway has served the 
maritime nations of the world almost without 
interruption, enabling them to ship their goods 
from the Atlantic to the Pacific and vice versa 
much faster and cheaper than would have otherwise 
been possible. Even with the advent of 
the supertanker and large container ships, the 
Panama Canal remains a vital link in world 
commerce through which 15 percent of America’s 
trade, and 5 percent of the world’s, 
passes. In fact, a number of ships today— 
Panamax vessels they are called—are being 
built to specifications that will enable them to 
just clear the canal when fully loaded. 

Credit for this outstanding operating record 
should go not only to those who have run the 
canal all these years but also to those who 
have provided security for it. For the 63 years 
prior to the signing of the Panama Canal Trea


ty of 1977 and during the 17 years since, the 
Armed Forces of the United States have stood 
watch over the canal from a series of military 
bases located in a 10-mile-wide strip of territory 
adjacent to the canal. From those bases, 
they have been in a position to deal effectively 
not only with immediate threats to the canal 
itself, but also with other problems that could 
have eroded hemispheric peace and security if 
left untended. An excellent example of the two 
combined came just a few weeks ago when 
Cuban refugees sent to Panama pending a 
determination of their status went on a rampage 
that had to be quelled by United States 
military personnel. 

The collapse of communism and the rise of 
the supertanker notwithstanding, there is good 
reason to believe that a smoothly operating, 
properly protected canal will be even more 
significant to the United States, Panama, Latin 
America and the rest of the world in the future. 
Several good reasons in fact. The conclusion 
of the NAFTA and the GATT agreements, not 
to mention the recent decision by the Summit 
of the Americas Conference in Miami to strive 
for an inter-American free trade zone by the 
year 2005, signal clearly a reduction in tariff 
and nontariff barriers throughout the region 
and the world. As they fall, the shipment of 
goods will inevitably rise as will the utility of 
the only vessel shortcut from the Atlantic to 
the Pacific and back. That being the case, the 
strategic significance of the Panama Canal, as 
one of the world’s great maritime chokepoints, 
will continue to grow, a fact that will not be 
lost on terrorist groups or renegade nations 
determined to achieve their objectives by 
whatever means necessary. With the weapons 
they have, or can acquire, either might exert, 
or try to exert, leverage if there is even the 
slightest perception that the Canal is open to 
mischief as well as commerce. 

So long as United States military personnel 
can be stationed in Panama and respond to 
any attacks on, or threats against, the canal, 
no such perception should exist. But, under 
the terms of the Panama Canal Treaty of 
1977, which is still in effect, the United States 
is scheduled to remove all its military personnel 
from Panama and turn over their bases 
to Panama by December 31, 1999. After that 
date, Panama will have the sole responsibility 
for not only operating but also defending the 
canal, a big task for a small nation. Unless, of 
course, an agreement is reached between the 
United States and Panama that will first, allow 
the United States to lease its military bases in 
Panama past the turn of the century, second, 
permit United States military forces to operate 
out of those bases, and third, enable the 
United States to guarantee the regular operation 
of the canal. 

The successful negotiation of such an 
agreement would be of particular benefit to 
Panama, as well as being of considerable assistance 
to the United States and the rest of 
the hemisphere. At present, some 6,000 jobs 
and $200–600 million in additional income for 
Panama are tied directly to the United States 
military establishment in what was formerly 
known as the Canal Zone. Remove that establishment 
and most of that money and those 
jobs will disappear, as will the prospect of 
lease payments that would otherwise result 
from the continued American use of its bases 
in the zone. Also lost would be an opportunity 
for Panama to forgo the cost of a military establishment, 
something it could safely do if the 

agreement provided that the United States 
would view an attack upon Panama in the 
same light as an attack upon itself. Compromised 
as well would be the possibility of a 
broader business understanding, under which 
the United States might lease the canal as 
well as its current military bases in exchange 
for such considerations as additional lease 
and/or dividend payments, trade concessions 
and/or an acceleration of prior U.S. treaty 
commitments. In short, Panama has even 
more to gain, relatively speaking, from a base 
rights/canal defense arrangement than does 
either the United States or its hemispheric 
neighbors, which may explain why public opinion 
polls taken there the past 2 years have 
consistently shown that at least two-thirds of 
those polled favor such an arrangement. 

Significantly, strong support for a 21st century 
base rights/canal defense agreement also 
exists in the United States. In fact, a nationwide 
poll taken last March demonstrated a 
level of support nearly as high in this country 
as has been evidenced in Panama. That being 
the case, one would think that serious negotiations 
to reach such an agreement would have 
gotten underway by now, especially since the 
time by which it should take effect is fast approaching. 
But, instead of moving forward to 
start these negotiations, governments in both 
the United States and Panama have been 
more inclined to hold back, preferring the 
other to take the lead. Understandable as that 
may be from the standpoint of national pride, 
the problem is time is of the essence if an 
agreement is to be reached before the impending 
United States withdrawal of its remaining 
military forces from Panama is, for all 
practical purposes, irreversible. Under terms of 
the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty, the United 
States departure from Panama must be complete 
by December 31, 1999 which means 
that, absent an understanding well before 
then, we must proceed with the systematic removal 
of our military forces and equipment before 
that time. Put simply, any further delay in 
opening negotiations, however well intended, 
not only dims their prospects but also the 
prospects for the continued safe and dependable 
operation of the canal itself. 

Under those circumstances, it seems to me 
that Congress is in a particularly good position—
a unique position in fact—to address 
their problem and help get these important negotiations 
started. If it were to pass a resolution 
advising the President to enter into such 
negotiations, then the question of whether the 
President or the Government of Panama 
should be the first to call for talks would be 
moot. Neither would be in the position of having 
initiated the request for negotiations, 
meaning that the latter should then be able to 
proceed with dispatch. Inaction by Congress, 
on the other hand, promises no such advantages. 
At best, it is likely to mean opportunity 
delayed or diminished. At worst, it could result 
in opportunity denied. 

Not wishing to share responsibility for either 
outcome, I am introducing today a sense-of-
Congress resolution calling upon the President 
to enter into negotiations for a base rights/ 
canal defense agreement with Panama. Specifically, 
the resolution calls for an agreement 
that would allow our military forces to be stationed 
in Panama after the turn of the century 
and would give those forces the right to act 
independently in order to guarantee the security 
and assure the regular operation of the

Panama Canal. In almost every respect, this 
resolution is identical to House Concurrent 
Resolution 17, which I introduced in the 103d 
Congress and which was cosponsored by no 
less than 85 of my colleagues. The only significant 
differences is that the passage of time 
has made its enactment all the more imperative. 
That being the case, I urge my colleagues 
join me as soon as possible as cosponsors 
of this resolution. Without being too 
specific, it provides the direction necessary to 
bring about a canal security arrangement that 
is not only needed but in the best interests of 
all concerned.

TRIBUTE TO JANET PARKER BECK 

HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to Janet Parker Beck—an award-
winning journalist for the San Mateo Times, 
book author, devoted mother, and caring 
wife—who passed away last month after an 
11-week battle with cancer. Having been a 
friend and admirer of Ms. Beck for many 
years, I know that her untimely death at the 
young age of 41 is a tremendous loss for her 
family, the San Mateo County community, and 
our country. 

Ms. Beck was born and raised in San Mateo 
and began her journalism career at Crestmoor 
High School in San Bruno. After graduating 
from college—having served as editor for student 
publications at Skyline Community College 
and San Jose State University—she was 
hired by the Times. During her career at the 
newspaper, Ms. Beck covered medical issues 
and legal affairs, including a dozen death-penalty 
cases and more than 40 murder trials. Her 
writing was widely respected by both the subjects 
of her stories and her readers for its intellectual 
contents, integrity, compassion, and 
ability to convey complex situations in a simple 
manner. She also used her writing talents 
to author the book, ‘‘Too good to Be True: The 
Story of Denise Redlick’s Murder,’’ which sold 
70,000 copies. 

Ms. Beck earned over 50 awards for her 
journalistic achievements. Among the many 
accolades she received, Ms. Beck was named 
the California Press Women’s Communicator 
of Achievement for 1994 and the National 
Federation of Press Women’s first-runner-up 
for Communicator of Achievement for 1994. 
She also received the National Federation of 
Press Women’s first place news writing award 
in 1986, 1987, and 1988. It was with a great 
source of pride that her award-filled career 
was capped off by being chosen to take her 
well earned place in the San Mateo County 
Women’s Hall of Fame. 

In addition to her considerable professional 
accomplishments, Ms. Beck took tremendous 
pleasure from her family, especially her husband 
of 16 years, Jim, and their five-year-old 
daughter, Mandy. Her desk was a well-known 
gallery for her daughter Mandy’s artwork and 
photographs, while Jim was her constant companion 
since they met at a YMCA dance in 
1970. 

Mr. Speaker, Janet Parker Beck was one of

INTRODUCTION OF THE MERCHANT 
MARINERS FAIRNESS ACT OF 1995 

HON. JACK FIELDS 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. FIELDS of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honor for me to reintroduce, along with our 
distinguished colleague LANE EVANS, on this 
first day of the new 104th Congress, the Merchant 
Mariners Fairness Act. 

During the last Congress, this bill received 
extensive consideration but, regrettably, it was 
not enacted into law. In fact, it was cosponsored 
by 241 Members and it was adopted by 
the House of Representatives on three separate 
occasions. 

The bill I am reintroducing today is the product 
of that careful consideration. It has been 
endorsed by many diverse groups, including 
the largest American Legion post in the United 
States, the Disabled American Veterans, and 
the AFL–CIO. It deserves the support of every 
Member of the House of Representatives. 

Mr. Speaker, by way of background, my colleagues 
should know that during World War II, 
some 17.9 million men and women were inducted 
into our Armed Forces. Of that figure, 

6.3 million volunteered and the remaining 11.6 
million were drafted. Of this total, some 6.4 
million or 35.8 percent were rejected for active 
duty because of various physical or mental 
disabilities. 
Furthermore, it is interesting to note that of 
the nearly 12 million Americans who served in 
active duty status, 73 percent served overseas 
and, of these, 38.8 percent had rear echelon 
assignments. I have presented these figures 
only to illustrate that millions of uniformed men 
and women never served outside of the 
United States. In no way does this denigrate 
or negate their vital service to this country. It 
simply means that these individuals were 
needed here in the United States to train 
those who did go overseas. 

Furthermore, some 270,000 men volunteered 
for service in the U.S. merchant marine. 
Many of these men joined the merchant 
marine because they had physical impairities, 
such as poor eyesight, or because they were 
too young to serve in the Army, Navy, or Marine 
Corps. Many of them could have avoided 
service but instead they chose to serve their 
country by enlisting in the U.S. merchant marine. 


Of the 270,000 that volunteered, 37 died as 
prisoners of war, 6,507 were killed in action 
and 4,780 are missing and presumed dead. In 
addition, some 733 U.S. merchant ships were 
destroyed. In fact, the casualty rate for the 
merchant marine was only one-tenth of 1 percent 
lower than the Marine Corps, which had 
the highest casualty rate of any branch of 
service during the war. 

In order to man our growing merchant fleet 
during World War II, the U.S. Maritime Com


mission established various training camps 
around the country under the direct supervision 
of the Coast Guard. After completing 
basic training, which included both small arms 
and cannon proficiency, a seaman became an 
active member of the U.S. merchant marine. 

These seamen helped deliver troops and 
war material to every Allied invasion site from 
Guadalcanal to Omaha Beach. They also 
transported troops back home to the United 
States and, when that task was completed, 
they carried food and medicine to millions of 
the world’s starving people. 

Mr. Speaker, it has been 49 years since the 
end of World War II. Nevertheless, there are 
still some Americans who served in that war 
who have not received the honors, benefits, or 
rights they deserve. H.R. 44 will correct that 
injustice by providing veterans status to some 
2,500 merchant mariners who have become 
the forgotten patriots of World War II. 

Unlike their brothers in uniform, America’s 
merchant seamen came home to no ticker-
tape parades or celebrations. Little, if anything, 
was said about the contributions they 
made to defeating the Axis powers or to preserving 
the freedoms that all Europeans and 
all Americans cherish. Worse, these merchant 
seamen came home to none of the veterans 
benefits enjoyed by other Americans who 
served their country during the World War II 
period. 

In 1987, after years of litigation and delay, 

U.S. District Judge Louis S. Oberdorfer ruled 
that previous decisions by the Air Force rejecting 
veterans status for World War II merchant 
seamen were ‘‘arbitrary and capricious and 
not supported * * * by substantial evidence.’’ 
Despite the results of this landmark court 
case, then Air Force Secretary Edward Aldridge 
unilaterally decided that World War II 
ended on August 15, 1945, for those who 
served in the U.S. merchant marine. 

Mr. Speaker, clearly, that was a most unfair 
and unsupportable decision. By establishing 
this date, the Secretary made a determination 
that has no basis in law. The August 15, 1945, 
date does not appear anywhere in the Federal 
court decision mandating veterans status and, 
according to the Air Force, there is no documentation, 
no precedent, and no justification 
for choosing V–J Day. 

Let me briefly describe why the August 15, 
1945, date is wrong and why these 2,500 
Americans have earned the right to be given 
veterans status. 

First, the Federal War Shipping Administration 
[WSA] was in control of all ship movements 
far beyond the date of August 15, 1945. 
In fact, the WSA did not go out of existence 
until August 31, 1946. Until that time, merchant 
mariners traveled under sealed orders 
on ships which were under the direct military 
control of the U.S. Navy. 

During the hearings on this legislation, we 
learned that at least 13 U.S. merchant vessels 
were damaged or sunk after August 15, 
1945—a greater number than were lost at 
Pearl Harbor. One of them was the S/S Jesse 
Billingsley, which was hit by a mine off the 
coast of Trieste, Yugoslavia, on November 19, 
1945. One U.S. merchant mariner lost his life 
in that explosion. 

In addition, we must remember that for the 

U.S. merchant marine, the war did not end on 

January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E23 

August 15, 1945. Defense shipping actually increased 
after that date to 1,200 sailings in December 
1945, as compared to the World War 
II monthly peak of 800. 

Second, while the Japanese indicated their 
desire to surrender on August 15, 1945, the 
situation facing the U.S. merchant marine did 
not radically change on that date. In fact, I 
have a copy of a telegram sent on August 15, 
1945, by the U.S. Naval Pacific Command 
which states that ‘‘for all merchant vessels in 
the Pacific Ocean areas, Japan has surrendered. 
Pending further orders, all existing instructions 
regarding defense, security, and 
control of merchant shipping are to remain in 
force. Merchant ships at sea, whether in convoy 
or sailing independently, are to continue 
their voyages.’’ 

Third, it wasn’t until December 31, 1946, 
that President Harry Truman declared in a 
press conference that he was issuing Proclamation 
2714, which states that ‘‘although a 
state of war still exists, it is at this time possible 
to declare, and I find it in the public interest 
to declare, that hostilities have terminated.’’ 


And, finally and most importantly, all of our 
Federal laws that affect those who served during 
the World War II period use the date December 
31, 1946. 

There is no arbitrary cutoff date for the Male 
Civilian Ferry Pilots, the Wake Island Defenders, 
the Guam Combat Patrol, or the Women’s 
Army Auxiliary Corps and there shouldn’t be 
any for our Nation’s merchant mariners. 

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 44 will correct Secretary 
Aldridge’s unfair decision by eliminating the 
unsupportable date of August 15, 1945. It is a 
fair solution to this problem because it treats 
all those who served during the World War II 
period in exactly the same manner. If an individual 
was in a Navy boot camp or Army basic 
training on December 31, 1946, then they 
have been considered a World War II veteran 
for the past 49 years. 

While the 2,500 Americans affected by H.R. 
44 would be eligible for a variety of veterans 
benefits, in reality the only benefits they are 
likely to obtain are recognition, the right to 
have a flag on their coffin, and a headstone. 

After all, education benefits have long since 
expired, people in their late-60’s do not buy 
new homes, and all of these individuals are already 
eligible for Medicare benefits. In short, it 
is highly unlikely that any of these individuals 
will ever obtain care at a VA hospital. In fact, 
we know that 76,000 merchant mariners have 
been given veterans status because of the 
1988 decision and, of that number, only a 
handful have received VA hospital benefits. 

Mr. Speaker, it is for this reason that the 
Congressional Budget Office has estimated 
that H.R. 44 would result in negligible outlays 
to the Federal Government in fiscal year 1995. 

I have been contacted by hundreds of people 
affected by Secretary Aldridge’s unfair decision. 
Each of these Americans share the 
common characteristic of love of country and 
the commitment to serve during one of the 
most difficult periods in our Nation’s history. 

Because of their young age or physical impairments, 
most of these men could have simply 
chosen to avoid service during World War 

II. However, they chose not to do so, and we 
must not, even at this late hour, forget them. 
Mr. Speaker, it is essential that we resolve 
this problem legislatively because the Department 
of the Air Force seems unwilling to correct 
it administratively. 

Finally, I would like to acknowledge the outstanding 
leadership of Congressman LANE 
EVANS. We have stood together on this legislation 
for a number of years and LANE EVANS 
is a champion for our Nation’s veterans. 

I urge the House of Representatives to 
move H.R. 44 so that we can finally provide 
these Americans with the recognition which 
they have long deserved. In my 15 years in 
Congress, I have never seen an issue, which 
affects so few people, attract the support of so 
many Americans. It is time we finally enacted 
this important legislation into law. These men 
have waited a lifetime to tell their grandchildren 
that they are World War II veterans.

SOCIAL SECURITY EARNING TEST 
REPEAL 

HON. BOB STUMP 

OF ARIZONA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. STUMP. Mr. Speaker, I am reintroducing 
legislation today to repeal the Social 
Security earnings test. As many of my colleagues 
know, the earnings test is one of the 
most unfair features of the Social Security 
law—limiting what Social Security recipients 
may earn and subjecting such recipients to 
what amounts to effective marginal tax rates 
of 50 percent or higher. 

The earnings test affects only recipients 
who must work. Those who rely upon investment 
income to supplement their Social Security 
are not affected. Only those who choose 
or are forced to return to the work force face 
reduction or loss of their benefits. 

Mr. Speaker, the work ethic should not end 
at age 62. Older people who wish to remain 
self sufficient through their own labors should 
not have to face a loss of their benefits. Nor 
should the Nation face the loss of the immeasurable 
talent and experience older workers 
bring to the work force. It is past time to repeal 
the Social Security earnings test. 

f 

FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY TAX EQUITY 
ACT 

HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR. 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, last year I introduced 
H.R. 1374, the Foreign Subsidiary 
Tax Equity Act, to discourage domestic corporations 
from establishing foreign manufacturing 
subsidiaries in order to avoid Federal 
taxes. Today, I am reintroducing this bill. 
American manufacturers for too long have 
abused the good faith of the American workers 
by developing manufacturing processes in 
this country before moving production facilities 
overseas and handing out pink slips back 
home. Despite the fact that America possesses 
the most productive and talented labor 
force in the world, many United States manufacturers, 
lured by cheap labor costs and tax 
holidays, have closed down plants and moved 
operations to countries like Mexico, Taiwan, 
and South Korea. 

Under my bill, foreign subsidiaries of U.S. 
companies that ship a significant portion of 

their products into the United States would be 
taxed as if that subsidiary were located in the 
United States. Simply, the intent of my bill is 
to discourage tax-motivated foreign investment 
while protecting the jobs of your constituents. 

Mr. Speaker, my bill is similar to legislation 
proposed by President Nixon in 1973, but the 
issue has been controversial since the inception 
of the corporate income tax in 1909. In 
1962, President John F. Kennedy proposed 
repeal the deferral of overseas investment in 
developed countries, but Congress did nothing. 


My bill would forbid foreign subsidiaries of 

U.S. companies from relocating manufacturing 
jobs in countries that provide tax holidays and 
other tax breaks and shipping a significant 
portion of their products into the United States. 
A current tax loophole allows these companies 
to avoid being taxed as if that subsidiary were 
located in the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, in addition to losing millions of 
dollars in income taxes due to this anomaly in 
our tax code, the United States is losing a 
major portion of its manufacturing base. Once 
the manufacturing base is gone, it will be very 
difficult to get back. Germany and Japan have 
clearly taken the lead in maintaining a strong 
and viable manufacturing sector as their 
economies have continued to outperform ours. 
Overall, maintaining a productive manufacturing 
base is the lifeline to a modern, high income, 
competitive economy. 

I have always believed the root of America’s 
social decay is the ill advised trade and tax 
policies Congress has advocated for the past 
25 years. Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to 
take a closer look at the problem of runaway 
manufacturing plants and co-sponsor this important 
legislation. My bill would be the first 
step in putting an end to this practice and 
make these companies pay their fair share.

FARM PRICES 

HON. LEE H. HAMILTON 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
insert my Washington Report for Wednesday, 
November 9, 1994, into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. 

FARM PRICES 
The United States is in the middle of the 
greatest harvest ever. The corn crop could be 
50% higher than last year, and soybean production 
will exceed the historic 1979 crop 
with excellent weather across the farm belt. 
The yields this year are simply phenomenal, 
as farmers continue to astound us with their 
productive capacity. 
The downside to this record production is 
lower prices. Steps are being taken, and others 
are under consideration, to help the 
farmer. In the long run, exports are the remedy, 
as consumers around the world demand 
high-quality American agricultural products. 
Ultimately, net farm income is projected 
to grow from $43 billion in 1993 to as 
much as $51 billion this year. 

PRICES 

Corn prices declined from a nationwide average 
of $2.61 per bushel in June to $2.09 per 
bushel in September. Some local elevators 
are currently reporting prices of less than 


E24 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 1995 

$2.00 per bushel. Prices normally decline at 
harvest time, but they are unusually low 
this year because of the record 1994 crop, projected 
at 9.6 billion bushels. The U.S. Department 
of Agriculture (USDA) has been criticized 
in some corners for setting the 1994 
Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) at zero 
percent. 

Soybean prices have also declined, from an 
average of $6.72 per bushel in June to $5.31 
per bushel in September—and less than $5.00 
per bushel at some local elevators. This decrease 
was fueled by the highest-ever national 
soybean yields, producing a record 
crop of between 2.3 billion and 2.5 billion 
bushels. Demand is expected to increase next 
year from greater exports and more livestock 
feeding, but not enough to compensate 
for the record crop. Low soybean prices are 
particularly damaging for Hoosier farmers 
because Indiana is the only major soybean 
state where the crop is projected to be lower 
than 1993. 

OPTIONS FOR RAISING PRICES 
I have urged the Department of Agriculture 
to consider a number of options to 
boost corn and soybean prices. Possibilities 
include: 
Increase corn ARP: USDA recently announced 
a preliminary 1995 corn Acreage Reduction 
Program of 7.5% below the established 
base. This would take land out of production 
and improve corn prices for the coming 
year. 
Raise corn support loan rate: Some farm 
groups have called for an increase in the 1994 
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loan 
rate from the current. $1.89/bushel to as high 
as $2.40/bushel. They claim this would have a 
direct impact on prices in the near future. 
USDA is considering an increase in the loan 
rate for 1995. 
Allow 1994 corn crop entry into Farmer— 
Owned Reserve: The President has allowed 
farmers to place 1994 corn in the Reserve 
when their CCC loans mature after 9 months. 
It is unclear what impact this would have on 
short-term prices. 
Soybeans on ‘‘flex’’ acres: If USDA determines 
that the price of soybeans next year 
will be below 105% of the loan level, it can 
prohibit program participants from planting 
soybeans on their optional flex acres. This 
would reduce production and increase prices. 
Export Enhancement Program (EEP): EEP 
has been used in the past to help export soybean 
oil. If world prices continue to fall, 
USDA could increase EEP support of soybean 
oil to maintain America’s competitive 
position. 
Ethanol and other alternative products: As 
of January 1, about 30% of the U.S. gasoline 
market will be required to use ethanol in reformulated 
gasoline. Over time, corn prices 
may rise as much as 20 cents per bushel because 
of this rule. Congress is also examining 
ways to encourage the use of soy ink and 
other non-food uses for American agricultural 
products. 
THE 1995 FARM BILL 
The effectiveness of these measures to support 
prices will also be addressed in the 1995 
farm bill. Government commodity support 
programs must be reauthorized next year. 
The 1990 farm act made farm programs more 
market-oriented, giving farmers more flexibility 
in choosing which crops to plant. A 
provision known as the Madigan amendment 
gave the Secretary of Agriculture more flexibility 
in setting loan rates and set-asides to 
maintain competitiveness in world markets. 
I expect this trend towards market flexibility 
to continue in the 1995 farm bill. Program 
flexibility puts more decisions in the 
hands of farmers rather than government bureaucrats, 
but it can also lead to greater 
price fluctuations for farmers. 

The farm bill should also address the hidden 
costs of farming. First, participating in 
crop support programs should be less complicated. 
The paperwork for program participation 
should not be a burden to farmers. 
Second, government regulations should be 
flexible at the local level. It is not possible 
to set detailed and comprehensive guidelines 
from the top, and major regulations should 
be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, using 
risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis. 

Some of the biggest issues in the 1995 farm 
bill will be environmental issues, including 
wetlands policy, and renewing the Conservation 
Reserve Program (CRP). Current wetlands 
policy that restricts farming on wetlands 
makes no distinction between wetlands 
that are environmentally important and 
those that are not. I am supportive of efforts 
to narrow the definition of wetlands. 

CRP has been successful at boosting prices 
and preserving valuable resources. Because 
of our terrain, the average Southern Indiana 
farmer receives even more in CRP payments 
than in deficiency payments, and I support 
the full reauthorization of CRP. In addition, 
the 1995 farm bill should make CRP flexible 
enough to distinguish between more and less 
environmentally important lands. The program 
should remain completely voluntary. 

CONCLUSION 

I recognize the great risks in the farming 
business. The risks involved in farming are 
greater than in most industries, and Congress 
should continue to provide some stability 
to agriculture and assure that farmers 
can maintain a decent living and have a reasonable 
return on their investments. The 
1995 farm bill is an opportunity to improve 
farm support programs and reduce the regulatory 
burden on farmers.

ENGLISH LANGUAGE TAX CREDIT 

HON. BILL EMERSON 

OF MISSOURI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. EMERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
introduce an important piece of legislation that 
I believe to be an integral part of the official 
English movement. As you may know, I am 
the author of H.R. 123, the Language of Government 
Act which seeks to make English the 
official language of the United States Government. 
This legislation is the perfect complement 
to the Language of Government Act. 
It recognizes the need for a highly skilled labor 
force and provides a tax credit to employers 
for the cost of providing English language instruction 
to their limited-English-proficient employees. 


Many Americans lack the language skills 
and literacy necessary to take full advantage 
of roles as responsible citizens and productive 
workers. While many employers acknowledge 
the need to educate their workers and have 
demonstrated an interest in establishing on-
site training programs for their employees, the 
high cost of doing so often prevents them from 
taking any concrete action. This legislation will 
provide them with an incentive to offer this 
crucial instruction to their employees and 
make the workplace a friendlier, and less 
daunting environment for non-English-proficient 
employees. 

NATIONAL SECURITY 

REVITALIZATION ACT 

HON. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. GILMAN. Mr. Speaker, on the opening 
day of this historic Congress, I take great 
pleasure in introducing the National Security 
Revitalization Act which implements the foreign 
affairs and the national defense provisions 
in the Contract With America. 

It is a great honor and privilege for me to 
serve as the chairman of the newly named 
International Relations Committee and I intend 
to ensure that our highest priority will be the 
consideration of this important and long overdue 
legislation which will ensure that we maintain 
a strong defense capability around the 
world and imposes serious limitations on the 
subordination of American troops to foreign 
command in United Nations peacekeeping operations. 


In addition, the bill will strengthen critically 
important regional institutions, such as the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and will ensure 
that our participation in any future U.N. 
mission directly serves our national interests. 

Together with my good friend and colleague, 
FLOYD SPENCE, the chairman of the 
National Security Committee, we will bring the 
National Security Revitalization Act back to the 
House floor to restore American credibility 
around the world and to ensure that Congress 
plays an enhanced role in the foreign policy 
making process. 

In the second session of the 103d Congress, 
Republican members of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee laid a solid foundation for the 
attainment of these objectives by championing 
key provisions in the Foreign Relations Act for 
fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995 and the 
NATO Participation Act which I introduced in 
March of last year. 

Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join me 
in cosponsoring this vitally important legislation.

INTRODUCTION OF RAPID DEPLOY-
MENT FORCE LEGISLATION 

HON. BARBARA B. KENNELLY 

OF CONNECTICUT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mrs. KENNELLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce legislation to establish a Rapid 
Deployment Force as an added resource of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This force 
would be temporarily deployed by the FBI, to 
assist local authorities in investigating an increasing 
of crime in a particular municipality, 
due to an increase of drug or gang related activity. 
The Rapid Deployment Force would represent 
a partnership between the Federal, 
State, and local crime fighting entities. 

This past weekend in my hometown of Hartford, 
CT, a rash of crime broke out leaving 
four dead, another critically wounded, and 
three others injured from gunshot wounds. 
This final criminal outbreak of 1994 brought 
the number of homicides in the city to 58, an 
increase of over 400 percent in the past 2 
years. As the spread of drugs, and the city’s 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E25 

gang problem continues to grow, the need for 
additional resources is evident. I am thankful 
that the recently enacted crime bill is bringing 
more cops on the beat into our Nation’s cities 
and towns. I commend the Attorney General 
and the Department of Justice for their work in 
ensuring the rapid appropriation of funds for 
the Cops on the Beat Program. 

However, it is not enough to just deploy 
more police officers on the street. A Federal 
Rapid Response team would bring with it resources 
and expertise that State and local 
governments cannot be expected to supply. I 
believe that a Rapid Deployment Force is essential 
in investigating and combating crime in 
towns and cities when drug and gang related 
activities escalate. And I urge my colleagues 
to support this important crime fighting legislation.

THE STUTTGART FISH FARMING 
EXPERIMENTAL LABORATORY 

HON. BLANCHE LAMBERT LINCOLN 

OF ARIZONA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
introduce legislation to transfer the Stuttgart 
Fish Farming Experimental Laboratory to the 
Department of Agriculture. 

The lab was established in 1958 under the 
Interior Department and charged with conducting 
research and experimentation to solve 
problems relating to the commercial production 
of warmwater fish. Located in the heart of 
the Nation’s catfish and baitfish production region, 
the lab and its staff have become nationally 
renowned for their work on behalf of the 
aquaculture industry. 

In the years since the laboratory was established 
aquaculture has progressed rapidly, becoming 
the fastest growing segment of U.S. 
agriculture, accounting for nearly 300,000 domestic 
jobs. My home State is the largest producer 
of commercial baitfish and the second 
largest producer of catifsh—accounting for 
nearly $100 billion in annual revenue. 

Mr. Speaker this simple bill will transfer the 
laboratory from the Interior Department to 
USDA. I believe that this move makes sense 
because the people who do business with this 
laboratory are farmers, and are best served by 
USDA. The bill also changes the laboratory’s 
name to the Stuttgart National Aquaculture 
Research Center to better reflect the excellent 
work that the lab produces. I look forward to 
passage of this legislation.

TRIBUTE TO SADIE HARVEY ODOM 

HON. THOMAS C. SAWYER 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. SAWYER. Mr. Speaker, every so often 
in life, if we are fortunate enough, someone 
comes along whose grace and wisdom enriches 
our own experience. Someone whose 
capacity to serve others inspires us to move 
beyond the limits we impose on ourselves, 
even as we wonder if we can ever match such 
a gift for giving. 

Sadie Harvey Odom, a 41-year resident of 
Akron, OH, was such a human being. Every 

person whose life she touched—from her family, 
to her friends, to the broader community in 
which she lived—marveled at her generosity 
of spirit, force of intellect, and strength of character. 


Born in Atlanta in 1924, Sadie Harvey completed 
high school at the age of 15. She went 
on to graduate cum laude 4 years later from 
Morris Brown College, where she was a 
founding member of the school’s Alpha Kappa 
Alpha sorority chapter. She had hoped to 
study medicine at the University of Georgia, 
but was denied admission because the school 
would not educate African-Americans. Always 
determined to forge ahead, Sadie Harvey 
worked in the aeronautical engineering lab at 
a U.S. Air Force base in Hampton, VA, during 
World War II. Upon returning to Atlanta after 
the war, she met and married Vernon Odom, 
with whom she would share the next 47 years 
of her life. The Odoms moved to Akron in 
1953, intending to stay only for 3 years. Instead, 
they spent the rest of their lives together 
in Akron, raising a family and devoting 
themselves to community service and the betterment 
of African-Americans. 

Vernon Odom headed the Akron Urban 
League and the Akron Community Service 
Center for nearly three decades. His beloved 
wife, Sadie, was beside him every step of the 
way. She was a guiding force behind local 
Urban League programs and volunteered with 
many other civic organizations, including the 
American Cancer Society, the United Negro 
College Fund, and the NAACP. 

Even as she gave selflessly of her time and 
herself in support of her community, Mrs. 
Odom raised a superb family of her own and 
worked as a medical technologist at St. Thomas 
Hospital. She applied her biology training to 
her volunteer work, as well, helping to test Akron’s 
schoolchildren for sickle cell anemia and 
elderly residents for diabetes. 

Mr. Speaker, there are many people in this 
world who live full, honest, and caring lives. 
And then there are the Sadie Odoms, whose 
integrity and selflessness leave a mark that is 
indelible. 

Sadie Harvey Odom passed away on October 
20, 1994, after a long illness. An entire 
community mourns as it contemplates this 
loss. But we also share the gratitude that 
comes from knowing a person with a heart of 
grace and a soul of love—from knowing Sadie 
Odom.

THE DEFENSE BUDGET AND 
MILITARY READINESS 

HON. LEE H. HAMILTON 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
insert my Washington Report for Wednesday, 
November 23, 1994, into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. 

THE DEFENSE BUDGET AND MILITARY 
READINESS 

The commitment of U.S. forces to Haiti 
and Kuwait has raised concerns about the 
‘‘thinning out’’ of the U.S. military since the 
end of the Cold War. Defense spending has 
declined by 11% since the 1989 peak of $303 
billion, following a decade of massive increases. 
The defense budget edged up this 
year to $264 billion, and is projected to stay 

near current levels over the next four years. 
The question now is whether defense spending 
is sufficient to meet the new and emerging 
threats to our interests here and abroad. 

NEW GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT 

There is no doubt that the United States is 
more secure today than it was when thousands 
of Soviet nuclear warheads targeted 
American cities. Today there is no comparable 
direct military threat to the United 
States. The U.S. is the strongest military 
power in the world today, and has the best 
trained and equipped fighting force. 

Yet, the world remains a dangerous place. 
The collapse of the Soviet empire has resulted 
in increasing instability in many 
parts of the world. Despite the desire of 
Americans to pay more attention to solving 
our own problems, we continue to have global 
interests that we must defend. Much of 
the world is threatened with chaos—full of 
civil wars, escalating ethnic and religious 
conflicts, and massive surges of refugees. 
Such instability can hurt the U.S. economy, 
limit our access to vital resources, including 
oil, and produce an international environment 
hostile to our interests and values. 

The post Cold-War world is not peaceful, 
but the U.S. cannot afford to intervene everywhere. 
The challenge today is to identify 
the interests we are prepared to defend by 
force and ensure that our armed forces have 
the tools they need to do the job we ask of 
them. This challenge becomes even more 
critical as we plan for an uncertain future, 
since defense budget decisions we make 
today will determine the kind of armed 
forces we will have several years down the 
road. 

THREAT-BASED DEFENSE 
Our defense spending should be based on 
threats to our national security. During the 
Cold War, the threat was the Soviet Union, 
and our spending on defense was designed to 
meet that threat. Our task is to reorient our 
defense to respond to new threats in the 
post-Cold War world. Those threats include: 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons and 
other weapons of mass destruction; the 
threat of large-scale aggression by major regional 
powers such as Iraq; the threats to democracy 
and reform movements in the 
former Soviet Union, particularly Russia; 
and economic dangers to our security if we 
fail to build a competitive and growing economy 
here at home. The bottom line is that it 
will cost the U.S. less to respond to these 
new threats than it cost us to meet the Soviet 
threat. 
The Pentagon has developed a defense plan 
that responds to the changed international 
environment. The so-called bottom-up review 
concludes that the U.S. must maintain 
a force capable of fighting and winning two 
nearly simultaneous regional wars, such as 
another Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and a North 
Korean invasion of South Korea. The Administration 
says that it has fully budgeted for 
its planned force structure, but that changes 
in inflation rates could change future funding 
needs. Others argue the budget crunch 
will be more severe as new procurement programs 
swell funding requirements. The Pentagon 
acknowledges it cannot fund all the 
new weapons programs now in development, 
and is assessing which programs to fund and 
which to cancel. 

READINESS 

After the end of the Vietnam War in the 
mid-1970s, rapid cuts in the defense budget 
and the loss of skilled personnel eroded the 

U.S. military’s combat readiness. Some critics 
say that we are now facing a similar 
problem of a ‘‘hollow military.’’ They say 
the costs of operations in Somalia, Rwanda 
and now in Haiti are placing an excessive 

E26 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 1995 

burden on the defense budget. They say these 
costs detract from our ability to respond effectively 
to more serious potential threats 
from Iraq and North Korea. Some even suggest 
the U.S. no longer has the capability to 
face down another Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 

While I believe the combat readiness of our 
armed forces needs improvement, I think 
comments about a ‘‘hollow military’’ are 
overstated. Military operations abroad have 
led to low readiness ratings in three of the 
Army’s 12 divisions and placed strains on 
other elements of the force, such as airlift. 
These trends must be promptly reversed. 
Even so, we still have by far the best-
equipped and best-trained military in the 
world. The transition to a more mobile force 
is involving painful adjustments in personnel, 
base closings and cancellations of 
new weapons systems. Yet, a recent report 
authored by a former Army Chief of Staff 
concluded that readiness is acceptable in 
most areas. 

Improving the readiness of U.S. forces 
should be the top budget priority for defense 
spending. Congress, with my support, has 
taken several steps this year toward this objective. 
These steps include: protecting military 
pay raises to ensure retention of high 
quality personnel; increasing overall spending 
on operations and maintenance, the key 
Pentagon account for readiness; increasing 
spending on airlift and sealift capabilities, 
which allow our forces to respond quickly to 
overseas threats in the Persian Gulf and 
elsewhere; boosting training support for battalion-
sized units; promoting ‘‘interservice’’ 
cooperation in combat and other missions, as 
evidenced by the joint Army-Navy effort in 
Haiti; and enhancing battlefield weapons 
systems. I will continue to support efforts to 
maintain our readiness. I think the military’s 
humanitarian and peacekeeping operations 
must not be permitted to bleed the 
Pentagon’s budget. 

CONCLUSION 

The U.S. must be careful about picking and 
choosing its military missions, so that U.S. 
forces do not become overextended. We cannot 
and should not commit U.S. forces to 
every trouble spot in the world. The key test 
is whether U.S. interests are threatened. 
Maintaining the readiness and morale of our 
military requires that we identify the interests 
we are prepared to defend by force, while 
using other means, including coalitions with 
our friends and allies, to deal with lesser 
threats to the U.S. national interest. A combat 
ready American military is essential to 
our national security.

RETIRED DISABLED LAW EN


FORCEMENT OFFICERS’ COUN


SELING NETWORK 

HON. JAMES A. TRAFICANT, JR. 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to reintroduce an important piece of legislation 
that I sponsored in the 103d Congress that 
would establish a national retired disabled law 
enforcement officers’ counseling network, and 
I urge my colleagues to become cosponsors. 

We call on police officers in emergencies. 
We trust them with our lives, families, and 
homes. Day in and day out most of us take 
them for granted to ensure our safety. Yet few 
of us truly appreciate the overwhelming stress, 
both mental and physical, that they endure in 
order to serve us. But there has never been 

a national proposal to give disabled retired police 
officers the psychological counseling they 
may need. Until now. 

Too often, retired disabled police officers 
suffer from depression, feelings of isolation, 
uncertainty of their futures, and worsening 
medical conditions. With appropriate counseling, 
many of these officers will learn to 
cope with their new lives and some will be 
able to obtain meaningful employment. 

My legislation would establish up to eight officer 
counseling centers throughout the United 
States to provide counseling to retired disabled 
officers and members of their immediate 
families. Any retired disabled Federal, State, 
county, city law enforcement officer, or special 
agent would be eligible to participate in this innovative 
and necessary program. 

I ask all Members to help those who have 
helped us. Please cosponsor this important 
legislative initiative.

THE RESCISSION OF CORPS OF 
ENGINEERS USER FEES 

HON. BILL EMERSON 

OF MISSOURI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. EMERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
introduce legislation to prevent the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers from collecting so-called 
user fees at certain facilities maintained and 
operated by the Corps. Specifically, this bill 
will repeal section 5001, Title V, of the Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 [OBRA] 
which authorized the Secretary of the Army to 
establish and collect fees for the use of developed 
recreation sites and facilities. 

These fees have been part of budget fiction 
for years. The White House has always proposed 
these onerous taxes and Congress has 
always rejected them. Unfortunately, these 
fees became a reality with the passage of 
OBRA. Furthermore, there are no guarantees 
that the revenue from these fees will be used 
by the Corps of Engineers for the maintenance 
of its facilities. I believe that with these 
fees going into general revenue—not the 
Corps budget—people who want to enjoy the 
great outdoors actually will end up paying 
twice, once as a taxpayer and once as a user 
of Corps facilities. 

While these fees, ranging from $3 per vehicle 
to $25 for a yearly pass, may not seem 
like a lot, the fact of the matter is that the 
American public has already paid once for 
these facilities and their continued upkeep. 
This, in my opinion, is double-dipping by the 
Federal Government. My legislation would 
seek to rescind the fee now required as outlined 
in OBRA for the use of public recreation 
areas at certain lakes and reservoirs under the 
jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers. 

It’s also important to note that the cost of installing 
boxes at the collection sites, in some 
instances, can exceed $25,000 depending on 
the location of the facility. So we are using operating 
and maintenance funds from the Corps 
to build the collection boxes in order to hit up 
the public for more funds that won’t necessarily 
go to the Corps. It’s reprehensible that 
an agency like the Corps of Engineers will 
spend its own funds so that it can collect 
money for the general treasury. 

This fee structure, as modest as it may be, 
sets a dire precedent. Americans who want to 

go boating, camping, or swimming should not 
be singled out to foot the bill for more Federal 
spending. Tourism and other recreational activities 
throughout the country could be negatively 
impacted with these fees. Folks simply 
do not want to pay over and over again for 
something that is already paid for; nor should 
they.

REFORM OF THE MINING LAW OF 
1872 

HON. NICK J. RAHALL II 

OF WEST VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing 
into the 104th Congress legislation to 
reform the mining law of 1872. Joining me in 
sponsoring this measure are GEORGE MILLER 
of California, CHRISTOPHER SHAYS of Connecticut, 
BRUCE VENTO of Minnesota, NEIL 
ABERCROMBIE of Hawaii, PETER DEFAZIO of Oregon 
and JERRY KLECZKA of Wisconsin. 

This bill, the Mineral Exploration and Development 
Act of 1995, is identical to the version 
of H.R. 322 which passed the House during 
the last Congress on November 18, 1993, by 
a bipartisan vote of 316 to 108. In fact, our 
new Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia 
[NEWT GINGRICH], voted for this bill at that 
time. Unfortunately, last year the House-Senate 
conference committee on mining law reform 
was unable to reach an agreement. 

Today, with the introduction of this measure, 
we begin where that historical debate left off. 
In my view, the advent of a new Congress 
with a Republican majority does not change 
the fundamental and bipartisan support that 
continues to be displayed for reforming the 
mining law of 1872. Indeed, the fiscal austerity 
being advanced by the Republican leadership 
may very well enhance our prospects for gaining 
enactment of this legislation, which has 
enjoyed the support of the National Taxpayers 
Union, during this Congress. 

Mr. Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues, 
many of whom may be new to this 
issue, in order to explain this measure perhaps 
it is best to briefly go back to the year 
1872. At the time, Ulysses S. Grant resided in 
the White House. Union troops still occupied 
the South. The invention of the telephone and 
Custer’s stand at the Little Bighorn were still 4 
years away. And in 1872 Congress passed a 
law that allowed people to go onto public 
lands in the West, stake mining claims, and, if 
any gold or silver were found, produce it for 
free. 

In an effort to promote the settlement of the 
West, Congress said that these folks could 
also buy the land from the Federal Government 
for $2.50 an acre. 

That was 1872. This is 1995, Yet, today, the 
mining law of 1872 is still in force. 

In 1995, however, for the most part it is not 
the lone prospector of old, pick in hand, accompanied 
by his trusty pack mule, who is 
staking those mining claims. It is large corporations, 
many of them foreign controlled, 
who are mining gold owned by the people of 
the United States for free, and snapping up 
valuable Federal land at fast-food hamburger 
prices. 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E27 

Remaining as the last vestige of frontier-era 
legislation, the mining law of 1872 played a 
role in the development of the West. But it 
also left a staggering legacy of poisoned 
streams, abandoned waste dumps, and 
maimed landscapes. 

Obviously, at the public’s expense, the 
western mining interests have had a good 
thing going all of these years. But the question 
has to be asked: Is it right to continue to allow 
this speculation with Federal lands, not to require 
that the lands be reclaimed, and to permit 
the public’s mineral wealth to be mined for 
free? 

Today, anybody can still go onto Federal 
lands in States like Nevada and Montana and 
stake any number of mining claims, each 
averaging about 20 acres. In order to maintain 
the mining claim, until very recently all that 
was required was that the claimholder spend 
$100 per year to the benefit of the claim. In 
the event hardrock minerals such as gold or 
silver are found on the claim, they are mined 
for free. There are no requirements that a production 
royalty be paid to the Federal Government. 


It is incredible, but true, that an estimated 

1.8 billion dollars’ worth of hardrock minerals 
are annually mined from Federal lands in the 
Western States in this fashion. Yet, the Federal 
Government does not collect one penny 
in royalty from any of this mineral production. 
Under the mining law of 1872, claimholders 
can also choose to purchase the Federal land 
being claimed. They can do this by first showing 
that the lands have valuable minerals, and 
then by paying the Federal Government a 
mere $2.50 or $5.00 an acre depending on 
the type of claim. This is called obtaining a 
mining claim patent. Perhaps a good feature 
in 1872, when the Nation was trying to settle 
the West. But today there is hardly a need to 
promote the additional settlement of L.A., San 
Francisco, or Denver. 

Recently, for example, a mining company 
received preliminary approval to obtain 25 of 
these patents covering about 2,000 acres of 
public land in Montana. This company will pay 
the Federal Government little more than 
$10,000 for land estimated to contain 32 billion 
dollars’ worth of platinum and palladium. 

Moreover, once the mining claim is patented, 
nothing in this so-called mining law 
says that it has to be actually mined. The land 
is now in private ownership. People are free to 
build condos or ski slopes on it. 

For example, a couple of years ago the Arizona 
Republic carried a story about a gentleman 
who paid the Federal Government 
$155 for 61 acres’ worth of mining claims. 
Today, these mining claims are the site of a 
Hilton hotel. This gentleman now estimates 
that his share of the resort is worth about $6 
million. 

Claimholders can also mine these Federal 
lands with minimal reclamation requirements. 
The only Federal requirement is that when operating 
on these lands they do not cause ‘‘unnecessary 
or undue degradation.’’ What does 
this term mean? It means that they can do 
whatever they want as long as it’s pretty much 
what all of the other miners are doing. And 
who will pay the bill for this abuse? Check 
over the Superfund National Priority List and 
you will learn the answer. 

I might add that the issue of mining law reform 
does not deal with coal, or that matter, oil 

and gas. These energy minerals, if located on 
Federal lands, are leased by the Government, 
and a royalty is charged. Further, mining law 
reform does not deal with private lands. The 
scope of the mining law of 1872 is limited to 
hardrock minerals such as gold, silver, lead, 
and zinc on Federal lands in the Western 
States. That is also the scope of this reform 
bill. 

In brief, the legislation we are introducing 
today would prohibit the continued give-away 
of public lands. It would require that mining 
claims be diligently developed. It would impose 
a royalty on the production of valuable 
minerals extracted from Federal lands. And, it 
would require industry to comply with some 
basic reclamation standards. 

Again, this legislation is identical to the bill 
which passed the House last year by a bipartisan 
3-to-1 margin. 

Mr. Speaker, I receive many calls in my office 
on the issue of mining law reform. When 
people learn that today, in 1995, gold and silver 
is still mined off public lands for free, they 
are, naturally, incredulous. The question is 
often asked: How come Congress has not 
done anything to reform the mining law yet? 

Frankly, as the Member who commenced 
this current effort to reform the mining law 
back in 1987, I, too, am incredulous that this 
law continues in force in a manner basically 
unchanged from its 1872 origins. Historically, 
the western hardrock mining industry has 
been successful in blocking any and all congressional 
reform initiatives. Lately, however, I 
have noticed an increasing sentiment within 
the more progressive element of the industry 
to settle this matter once and for all. Perhaps 
1995 will be the year in which the voice of this 
element of the industry will become the dominating 
voice of the industry overall. 

For the benefit of my colleagues, following I 
offer a brief history on the effort to reform the 
mining law of 1872: 

HISTORY OF MINING LAW REFORM 

The genesis of mining law reform dates 
back to 1879, seven years after the enactment 
of the Mining Law of 1872. At that time, Congress 
created the first major Public Land 
Commission to investigate land policy in the 
West. One of its major recommendations included 
a thorough rewrite of the 1872 law 
which even then was believed by many to undermine 
efficient mineral development. 

Several decades later, in 1908, President 
Roosevelt created the National Conservation 
Commission to study Federal land policy in 
the West, and it, too, made a number of recommendations 
for reform of the Mining Law. 
Again, in 1921, a committee appointed by the 
Director of the Bureau of Mines recommended 
a series of reforms, developed in 
concert with mining industry representatives 
interested in improving the mechanics 
of the law. These recommendations were embodied 
in legislation introduced in both 
houses of Congress and hearings were held in 
1922, however, no action was taken at that 
time. 

Following this effort, the next call for reform 
came at the onset of World War II, 
when then Secretary of the Interior Harold 
Ickes endorsed a leasing system for hardrock 
mining. In 1949, the Hoover Commission on 
Organization of the Executive Branch of the 
Government, like the first Public Land Commission, 
recommended a series of changes to 
the Mining Law. This effort was succeeded 
by the President’s Materials Policy Commis


sion (the Paley Commission) in 1952 which 
also recommended revisions, including placing 
hardrock minerals under a leasing system. 
Once again, the criticism centered on 
inefficiencies in mineral development caused 
by the law. 

Between 1964 and 1977 Congress went 
through another period of debate on mining 
law reform. The debate became more complex 
during that time as issues related to 
abuse and the need for environmental protections 
were added to the mix. The Public 
Land Law Review Commission, created by 
Congress in 1964, made the Mining Law a 
prominent issue on its agenda. Following 
issuance of the Commission’s report in 1970, 
Congress debated the issue until 1977, when 
efforts to reform the mining law collapsed. 

After a decade-long hiatus, on June 23, 
1987, what was then known as the Subcommittee 
on Mining and Natural Resources 
held an oversight hearing on the Mining Law 
of 1872, initiating the current round of Congressional 
debate on reform. Subsequently, 
the Subcommittee held a number of hearings 
on specific issue areas related to hardrock 
mining on public lands, such as: hardrock 
mine reclamation and bonding requirements, 
abandoned mine land problems, mining 
claims on Stock Raising Homestead Act 
lands, uncommon varieties of hardrock minerals, 
regulation of hardrock mining wastes, 
and oil shale claims. On September 6, 1990, 
the Subcommittee on Mining and Natural 
Resources conducted a hearing on the first 
reform measure introduced into the House in 
over a decade, H.R. 3866, sponsored by then 
Subcommittee Chairman Rahall. This hearing 
was augmented by several reports produced 
by the U.S. General Accounting Office 
at the Subcommittee’s request: An Assessment 
of Hardrock Mining Damage (1988); The 
Mining Law Needs Revision (1989); Unauthorized 
Activities Occurring on Hardrock Mining 
Claims (1990); Patenting of Mining 
Claims Complies with Law (Oregon Dunes) 
(1990); and, Increased Attention Being Given 
to Cyanide Operations (1991). 

At the commencement of the 102nd Congress, 
on February 6, 1991, H.R. 918 was introduced 
by Rep. Nick Rahall. During the first 
session of that Congress, the Subcommittee 
on Mining and Natural Resources held four 
field hearings on the bill in Denver, Colorado 
(April 12, 1991); Reno, Nevada (April 13, 1991); 
Sante Fe, New Mexico (May 3, 1991); and 
Fairbanks, Alaska (May 25, 1991). Two additional 
days of hearings were held on the bill 
in Washington, D.C. on June 18, 1991, and 
June 20, 1991. On June 24, 1992, H.R. 918 was 
favorably considered by what was then 
known as the Committee on Interior and Insular 
Affairs which reported the bill with 
amendments by a roll call vote of 26 to 19. 
The House began floor consideration of the 
bill, but did not complete action on the 
measure prior to the adjournment of the 
102nd Congress. 

At the beginning of the 103rd Congress, on 
January 5, 1993, Rep. Rahall introduced H.R. 
322, which closely mirrored the version of 

H.R. 918 previously considered on the House 
Floor. On March 11, 1993, the Subcommittee 
on Energy and Mineral Resources held a 
hearing on the bill and on October 28, 1993, 
the Subcommittee favorably reported the 
bill as amended. On November 3, 1993, the 
Committee on Natural Resources favorably 
reported the bill as amended by a vote of 28 
to 14. H.R. 322 was passed by the House on 
November 18, 1993, by a vote of 316 to 108. Unfortunately, 
during the 103rd Congress a 
House-Senate conference committee on mining 
law reform was unable to reach an agreement. 

E28 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 1995 

ANTITRUST AND COMMUNICATIONS 
REFORM ACT OF 1995 

HON. EDWARD J. MARKEY 

OF MASSACHUSETTS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as 
an original cosponsor of legislation introduced 
today which proposes to update our Nation’s 
communications laws for the information age. 

Introduced by my colleague JOHN DINGELL, 
this legislation embodies measures—H.R. 
3626 and H.R. 3636—which were approved in 
overwhelming fashion by the House in the previous 
Congress. Together, these bills represented 
the Nation’s roadmap for the information 
superhighway. I want to commend my 
distinguished colleague, Mr. DINGELL, for 
quickly bringing these issues to the attention 
of the House by introducing this legislation on 
the opening day of the 104th Congress. 

Although approved by impressive margins in 
the House, the Senate was unable to complete 
work on a similar measure due to a 
number of factors, including the lack of sufficient 
days remaining in the legislative calendar. 


Titles III, IV, V, and VI of the bill introduced 
today consist of the language of H.R. 3636, 
which I introduced in the 103d Congress with 
Representative JACK FIELDS. Working closely 
in bipartisan fashion with our other subcommittee 
colleagues, we were able to propose 
radical changes and needed reforms to 
our Nation’s communications laws. This bill 
passed the House by a vote of 423 to 4 last 
year. 

It is my hope to again work closely with 
now-Chairman FIELDS and other committee 
members, in a nonpartisan way, to repeat our 
legislative success in the new Congress. 

The purpose of this legislation is to help 
consumers by promoting a national communications 
and information infrastructure. This 
legislation seeks to accomplish that goal by 
encouraging the deployment of advanced 
communications services and technologies 
through competition, by safeguarding ratepayers 
and competitors from potential anticompetitive 
abuses, by preserving and enhancing 
universal service, and by addressing 
longstanding legal and regulatory issues 
posed by the Modification of Final Judgment 
[MFJ], which broke up Ma Bell a decade ago. 

The bill will preserve and enhance the goal 
of providing to all Americans high-quality 
phone service at just and reasonable rates. 
This goal of universal service is one of the 
proudest achievements of our Nation during 
the 20th century, and this legislation will ensure 
it endures beyond the year 2000. 

Second, the legislation will promote and accelerate 
competition to the cable television industry 
by permitting telephone companies to 
compete in offering video programming. Specifically, 
the bill would rescind the statutory 
ban on telephone company ownership and delivery 
of video programming. Telephone companies 
would be permitted, through a separate 
subsidiary, to provide video programming to 
their subscribers so long as they establish an 
open system to permit others to use their 
video platforms. But they must enter the business 
the old fashioned way: by building a new 
system and not just through buying up an existing 
system. 

In addition, the legislation will promote competition 
in the local telephone market. This 
market is one of the last monopoly markets in 
the entire telecommunications universe. We all 
have witnessed how the long distance market 
and the telecommunications equipment market 
has benefited tremendously from competition. 
Just 10 years ago, you had one choice in long 
distance—AT&T—and one choice for a 
phone—black rotary dialed. 

Through Federal policies, hundreds of 
equipment makers and long distance companies 
now exist, providing rigorous competition. 
We can see those same benefits in the local 
telephone market, and thereby benefit consumers 
by giving them more choice at lower 
prices. 

Moreover, the legislation addresses issues 
related to the breakup of AT&T. The bill lays 
the foundation to resolve issues with respect 
to the line of business restrictions placed upon 
the Bell operating companies at the time of 
the breakup. It sets the stage for determining 
how and when a Bell company may participate 
in the long distance marketplace. 

In addition, this legislation stipulates the 
terms and conditions for Bell company participation 
in the information services, alarm, and 
equipment manufacturing markets. This legislation 
will effectively take these issues out of 
the courts and will provide a blueprint to the 
Federal Communications Commission, the Department 
of Justice, and State regulators as to 
how to move the industry toward greater competition 
while protecting consumers and competitors 
from the potential for monopoly 
abuses. This bill will also provide a modicum 
of certainty to participants in the marketplace, 
allowing CEO’s, investors, and entrepreneurs 
to effectively plan for the future. 

Again, I want to commend Mr. DINGELL for 
introducing this legislation. I look forward to 
working with him, Mr. FIELDS, Mr. BLILEY, and 
other committee colleagues, on legislation to 
overhaul the 1934 Communications Act for the 
1990’s.

TRIBUTE TO JOE PATERNO AND 
THE NITTANY LIONS 

HON. WILLIAM F. CLINGER, JR. 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. CLINGER. Mr. Speaker, on this historic 
first day of the 104th Congress, I would like to 
publicly extend my warmest congratulations to 
Joe Paterno and the Nittany Lions of Penn 
State on their Rose Bowl victory. 

As the winner of the Big Ten Conference, 
the Nittany Lions went to Pasadena to meet a 
worthy adversary, and the Oregon Ducks 
proved to be just that. In the end, however, 
Penn State triumphed, 38 to 20, after displaying 
fine teamwork and unrelenting determination. 


With this Rose Bowl victory, Joe Paterno 
passes Bear Bryant as the coach with the 
most bowl game victories to his credit. This 
win completes the fifth undefeated season in 
his 29 years of coaching at Penn State. 

The Associated Press and CNN/USA Today 
have awarded the national championship to 
another undefeated team, but in my mind 
Penn State has earned the right to be called 
a national champion. 

While my colleagues from Nebraska may 
disagree with my assessment of Penn State’s 
ranking, the only way to settle, once and for 
all, the question of which team is the national 
champion can only be decided in a head-to-
head competition. As USA Today indicated in 
a cover story headline yesterday, without a 
match between these two undefeated teams, 
the question of which team is better is still 
open to debate. 

One thing is certain, Pennsylvanians and 
Penn State alumni across the country can 
take pride in the performance of this team and 
the football program at Penn State. With many 
of the players returning next year, we may see 
this open question settled after all.

PROGRESS ON THE ECONOMY 

HON. LEE H. HAMILTON 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. HAMILTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
insert my Washington Report for Wednesday, 
October 26, 1994, into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. 

PROGRESS ON THE ECONOMY 
One of the top concerns of Hoosiers remains 
the economy and the economic outlook. 
Hoosiers are concerned about the budget 
deficit, our international competitiveness, 
and especially jobs and job security. At the 
same time, most recognize that progress is 
being made and that the economy is doing 
better now than it has for years. Over the 
last two years we have made major progress 
on the budget deficit. That in turn has given 
a significant boost to the economy. We need 
to build on these successes and continue the 
basic policies that have helped turn things 
around. Certainly there is still much room 
for improvement in the economy, but there 
is little evidence that our economic policy 
needs a major change in direction. 

PROGRESS ON THE ECONOMY 

In January 1993, both the federal deficit 
and federal spending as a share of the economy 
were spiraling upward, while the economy 
was in the slowest recovery of the postwar 
era. The President and Congress passed 
the deficit reduction package last year 
which led to a dramatic drop in the deficit, 
and also has sparked a steady, sustainable 
economic recovery. Critics were saying that 
the package would cause a recession and 
higher unemployment. It has had just the 
opposite effect, boosting the economy in several 
key ways. 

Deficit reduction: The $430 billion deficit 
reduction package means that the deficit 
will decline for three years in a row—the 
first time that has happened since the Truman 
Administration. We are finally getting 
a handle on the deficit—bringing it down 
from $290 billion in 1992 to a projected $160 
billion next year. That will make the deficit 
as a share of the economy the lowest since 
1979, and one of the lowest of all the major 
industrialized countries. 

By 1998 the national debt will be $650 billion 
lower than was projected before the passage 
of the deficit reduction plan. (Two-
thirds of this comes directly from the deficit 
reduction package, the rest from the 
strengthened economy.) That’s $10,800 of reduced 
federal debt for each family of four in 
Indiana. We need to continue these deficit 
reduction efforts rather than reverse course. 

Growth: The U.S. economy is growing at a 
solid, sustainable pace. The rate of economic 


January 4, 1995 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E29 

growth, which averaged 1.5% in the Bush Administration, 
has more than doubled to 3.3% 
in the Clinton Administration. The U.S. 
economy is growing faster than any other 
major industrialized country. Our projected 
growth rate of around 3% is about where we 
want it—much slower and it would lead to 
rising unemployment, much faster and it 
would reignite inflation. 

Unemployment: The unemployment rate 
has come down from 7.1% in January 1993 to 
5.9% today. Some 4.6 million new jobs have 
been created since January 1993, compared to 

2.4 million over the previous four years. 92% 
of these jobs have been in the private sector, 
compared to 54% during the Bush Administration. 
American job growth this year will 
exceed job growth of all the other major industrialized 
countries combined. 
In Indiana, the unemployment rate has 
dropped from 5.9% in January 1993 to 5.1%. 
The number of Hoosier jobs has grown by 
155,000 in the last two years, after declining 
by almost 100,000 in the three previous years. 

This is solid progress on the jobs front, and 
we need to continue the deficit reduction 
lower interest rates, and strong economic 
growth that have helped bring it about. 

Productivity: Higher productivity is key to 
an increased standard of living for American 
workers. Productivity has increased at an 
annual rate of 2.2% since the beginning of 
1993—a significant improvement over the 
record of the 1980s. The lower interest rates 
resulting from deficit reduction have boosted 
investment and productivity. 

Inflation: It has been a significant accomplishment 
that we have done so well in 
boosting economic growth and lowering unemployment 
without reigniting inflation. Inflation 
since January 1993 has averaged 
2.8%—the lowest level in 30 years. 

Income growth: Income growth is one aspect 
of the recovery that remains disappointing. 
Median family income has not 
kept up with inflation in recent years. It 
grew slightly last year, but after adjusting 
for inflation actually declined by about 1%. 
This is a slight improvement over the previous 
four years, but still disappointing. 
Family incomes in Indiana did not decline 
like the rest of the country, but they did not 
grow either. 

This has made many people skeptical 
about overall progress on the economy since 
they have not felt it much in their paychecks. 
Although most workers saw a modest 
increase in their total compensation— 
wages plus benefits—during the past decade, 
it was much less than in earlier decades and 
most of the increase recently has gone for 
higher employee health insurance premiums. 
So workers have not seen much increase in 
their paychecks. Making real progress on 
takehome pay will require continued strong 
economic growth, increased investment, as 

well as meaningful health care reform that 
reins in escalating health care costs. 

Trade deficit: A second disappointment is 
the trade deficit. Since the mid-1970s, the 

U.S. has been importing more goods and 
services than it has exported. The trade deficit 
in goods and services, which peaked at 
$150 billion in 1987, fell to $30 billion in 1991. 
Since then, severe recessions in Europe and 
Japan have reduced their ability to buy U.S. 
products, driving our trade deficit up to the 
$80–90 billion range. This should turn around 
as Europe and Japan recover. 
CONCLUSION 

Certainly we need to continue to focus on 
improving our country’s economic future, 
but we have made significant progress in 
shoring up the economy during the past two 
years. An independent study recently found 
that the U.S. now has the world’s most competitive 
economy, overtaking Japan for the 
first time since 1985. Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan said earlier this year 
that because of the deficit reduction effort, 
‘‘. . . the foundations of the economic expansion 
are looking increasingly well-entrenched’’. 
We need to continue the policies 
that have made the difference—meaningful 
deficit reduction, moderate interest rates, 
and an emphasis on productive investment. 
These policies are working and we should 
stick with them.

TRIBUTE TO THE DWIGHT 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 

HON. THOMAS W. EWING 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. EWING. Mr. Speaker, as we convene 
the 104th Congress, and welcome each of the 
new Members to this assembly of the people, 
I am reminded not only of our duty to preserve, 
protect, and uphold the U.S. Constitution, 
but of the vital role an educated citizenry 
plays in the effective governing of our country. 
As Members of Congress we have a responsibility 
to promote civic education and to recognize 
those who excell in their studies. 

This is why I am proud to enter into the permanent 
RECORD of the 104th Congress the 
names of the following distinguished students 
from Dwight Elementary School in the 15th 
District of Illinois who have been awarded a 
Certificate of Achievement from the Center of 
Civic Education, for their study of the history 
and principles of the Constitution of the United 
States of America. The honorees are: Joseph 
Brassard, Robert Breese, Timothy Brown, Lori 

Eggenberger, Nathan Hoegger, Pamela 
Maeder, Bryan Neville, Anita Nourie, Curtis 
Price, Falynne Price, Amber Riegel, Dennis 
Robisky, Andrea Scott, Jennifer Small, Jason 
Spandet, Joey Stevenson, Kathleen Stewart, 
Joann Weller, and Rhea Ann Wilson. 

Who knows, Mr. Speaker? Some of these 
students may serve in the U.S. House of Representatives 
one day. Most important, however, 
is that these students help to educate 
other citizens about the importance of public 
participation and the virtues of good government. 


Mr. Speaker, I offer my congratulations to 
these fine students.

PROTECT LIFE: NOW AND 
FOREVER 

HON. BILL EMERSON 

OF MISSOURI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Wednesday, January 4, 1995 

Mr. EMERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
introduce legislation which will begin the process 
of amending the Constitution to protect 
human life in all its stages. 

Over the past 2 years, the administration 
has touted its pro-abortion policies. In fact, 
States across the Nation are being notified 
that they breaking the law if they continue to 
refuse to provide abortions under the Medicaid 
Program. This must stop, and an amendment 
to the Constitution will do just that. 

The U.S. Congress has been quick to defend 
the interests of the poor and the homeless, 
who have no effective advocate for their 
cause—and indeed those are worthy efforts. 
Yet Congress has, for too long, ignored the 
most silent voice of all, that of an unborn child. 

The U.S. legal system is firmly based on 
morals. Is it right or wrong to steal? Is it right 
or wrong to hurt another person? Is it right or 
wrong to drive an automobile carelessly, thus 
endangering the lives of others? The answer 
to all of these questions is, of course, it is 
wrong. 

The fact remains that abortion is the taking 
of an innocent human life—a killing that is 
morally wrong. The solution is to amend the 
Constitution and clarify that basic human 
rights extend to all—including the unborn. 

I urge my colleagues in the House to put 
this scandalous chapter in our Nation’s history 
to an end by starting the process which would 
amend the Constitution to protect all life.

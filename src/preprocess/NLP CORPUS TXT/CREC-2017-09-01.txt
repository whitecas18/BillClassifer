United States 
of America PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATES OF THE 115th 
CONGRESS, FIRST SESSION 

Vol. 163 WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 2017 No. 141 

House of Representatives 

The House met at 1 p.m. and was

DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 

The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before 
the House the following communication 
from the Speaker: 

WASHINGTON, DC,

PRAYER 

Rabbi Arnold E. Resnicoff, Retired 
Chaplain, U.S. Navy, Washington, D.C., 
offered the following prayer: 

God, author of liberty, we pray, reflect, 
meditate in different ways, but 
sing ‘‘My Country, ‘Tis of Thee,’’ for 
unalienable rights, our Nation’s backbone, 
come from You. 

Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness— 
pursuing justice too—doors opened; 
walls and ceilings shattered; freedom 
shining through. 

Today, in 1939, Hitler invades Poland. 
War spreads: liberty, life denied beyond 
a chosen few. 

Humanity itself rejected with the 
Nazi stamp: ‘‘life—unworthy of life.’’ 

We fought, died for freedom’s cause. 

Lincoln taught: remember those who 
fought, gave their all, by continuing 
their unfinished work with increased 
devotion to their cause. Then they 
don’t die in vain. 

Neo-Nazis, racists, bigots, would 
quench the flame of freedom’s holy 
light. 

We pray for, rescue Harvey’s victims, 
but hatred’s storm clouds gather, 
threaten all. 

Help us reaffirm our vision—brighter, 
more inclusive than before: every 

human life created equal, holy, none 
less human than our own. 

And may we say, amen.

EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS 

IN RECOGNITION OF THE SACRAMENTO 
JAPANESE AMERICAN 
CITIZENS LEAGUE SCHOLARSHIP 
AWARD RECIPIENTS 

HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, September 1, 2017 

Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize this year’s Sacramento Japanese 
American Citizens League’s (JACL) high 
school scholarship recipients. As the members 
of the Sacramento JACL, the student’s and 
their families gather to celebrate, I ask all of 
my colleagues to join me in recognizing these 
deserving young men and women. 

Each year, the JACL provides scholarships 
to a select group of high school students who 
have demonstrated outstanding academic excellence 
and achievement, as well as community 
service and a desire to pursue higher education. 
This year, five outstanding students will 
receive scholarships provided by dedicated 
members of JACL, VFW Post 8985, and the 
community. This year, Kiyomi A. Sun is receiving 
the Harry and Kinu Masaki Memorial 
Scholarship and the Nisei VFW Post 8985 
Scholarship. Allie T. Umemoto is receiving the 
Kiyoto and Rika Kawakami Memorial Scholarship, 
and the Noboru and Akiko May Shirai 
Memorial Scholarship. Kyle W. W. Kawakami 
is receiving the Fumio Jesse and Kiyoko 
Miyao Memorial Scholarship and The Nikkei 
Singles Club Scholarship. Cody M. Kurahara 
the Harry and Kinu Masaki Memorial Scholarship 
and the Nisei VFW Post 8985 Scholarship. 
And last but not least, Nozomi M. 
Schmoock is receiving the Sacramento JACL 
Chapter Scholarship. 

The Sacramento Japanese American Citizens 
League is dedicated to protecting communities 
affected by bigotry and injustice as 
well as advancing the civil rights of all Americans. 
It also helps to guide the Japanese 
American community to further social and economic 
equality. I trust that the students being 
recognized will carry this tradition forward to 
protect and help fight for the civil rights of all 
of our citizens and remain engaged in their 
communities. 

Mr. Speaker, as these students are being 
honored by the Japanese American Citizens 
League members, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in wishing them success in their future en

IN HONOR OF SERGEANT ERIC 
SOSSOMAN’S SERVICE TO OUR 
COMMUNITY WITH THE 

CABARRUS COUNTY SHERIFF’S 
DEPARTMENT 

HON. RICHARD HUDSON 

OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, September 1, 2017 

Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Sergeant Eric Sossoman for his 28 

years of service with the Cabarrus County 
Sheriff’s Department in North Carolina’s Eighth 
Congressional District. 

Growing up in Cabarrus County, Sergeant 
Sossoman always had a profound sense of 
duty to his hometown. In 1989, he began his 
career at the Sheriff’s Department, starting in 
communications the very day Hurricane Hugo 
ripped through our state. Since then, Sergeant 
Sossoman has held many positions with the 
Sheriff’s Department, including the Civil Division 
where he became the Department’s first 
Social Services officer, the Crime Prevention 
Division, Recruitment and Retention Division 
and as a member of the SWAT team. 

Throughout his career, Sergeant Sossoman 
has exhibited unwavering commitment to our 
community and we are fortunate to have had 
him as a leader for all these years. Some of 
the many notable accomplishments during his 
career include bringing back the Crime Stoppers 
program, which was so successful that 
he was named the President of the North 
Carolina Association of Crime Stoppers, and 
coordinating the county’s annual Law Day, 
which honors fallen officers from Cabarrus 
County, the state and nationwide. 

It is my hope that Sergeant Sossoman will 
enjoy his retirement and remain a role model 
for all those he helped over the years. 

Mr. Speaker, please join me today in honoring 
the career of Sergeant Eric Sossoman 
for his service to our community. We all wish 
him well as he begins the next chapter of his 
life in retirement.

HONORING THE 40TH ANNIVER


SARY OF SERVICE BY REV


EREND DR. AMOS C. BROWN 

HON. NANCY PELOSI 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, September 1, 2017 

Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise with pride 
today to join my beloved city in recognizing 
the 40th Anniversary of Reverend Dr. Amos C. 
Brown as the pastor of the Third Baptist 
Church of San Francisco and honoring his lifetime 
of moral leadership, political activism and 
spiritual guidance. 

Born and raised in Jackson, Mississippi, 
Reverend Brown’s history of activism and his 
deep involvement in the civil rights movement 
began at an early age. He was only a teenager 
when he assumed leadership of his local 
NAACP chapter and was driven cross-country 
to San Francisco by activist Medgar Evers to 
meet the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. 
Later, Brown attended Morehouse College 
where he was hand-selected by King as one 
of his eight students, inspiring him to seek a 
lifetime of service on behalf of civil rights and 
social justice. He was arrested together with 
Dr. King during a lunch counter sit-in Atlanta 
department store, and became one of the 
fearless Freedom Riders in 1961. 

Brown received both a Mastery of Divinity 
from Crozer Theological Seminary and a Doc


tor of Ministry from United Theological Seminary. 
Our city was fortunate to welcome the 
Pastor and his beloved wife Jane Smith Brown 
in 1976, when they made San Francisco their 
home and the Third Baptist Church their place 
of worship and leadership. 

Brown’s vision of the church as a holy place 
of prayer, and also a place of civic engagement 
and social action, transformed the Third 
Baptist Church into a congregation at the forefront 
of the fight for civil rights. His unwavering 
belief in future generations drove the church to 
establish a summer school program, an after-
school academic enrichment program, ‘‘Back 
on Track’’, and the Charles A. Tindley Academy 
of Music. 

Brown’s influence also extended beyond his 
local community when the church sponsored 
80 children from Tanzania to receive heart 
surgery in the United States, and his congregation 
sponsored more African refugees 
than any other local congregation in the nation. 
This global reach and visionary leadership 
was recognized when Brown was appointed 
as a delegate to the 2001 United Nations 
Conference on Race and Intolerance in 
Durban, South Africa, representing the National 
Board of the NAACP. 

Closer to home, Brown was awarded the 
Martin Luther King Jr. Ministerial Award for 
outstanding leadership and contributions to the 
Black Church in America and he was inducted 
into the International Hall of Fame of the King 
International Chapel at Morehouse College. 
He has served as the president of the NAACP 
Branch in San Francisco, as a San Francisco 
Community College Trustee and as a San 
Francisco County Supervisor. 

A passionate fighter and voice for the most 
vulnerable in our community, Reverend Amos 
Brown has served as a source of change, 
strength and faith for 40 years. I congratulate 
him, along with his wife Jane and his children 
Amos C. Brown Jr., David Josephus and 
Kizzie Marie, on this milestone celebration and 
extend my best wishes as he continues to 
lead and inspire our community.

HONORING THE CRANE FAMILY 

HON. MIKE THOMPSON 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, September 1, 2017 

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Richard, Cindy and Jennifer 
Crane for receiving the annual Leadership 
in Agriculture Award from the Santa Rosa 
Metro Chamber. 

Richard Hope Crane arrived in California in 
1849 as part of the great California Gold 
Rush. A few years later, the family settled in 
Santa Rosa. They built Crane Melon Barn on 
Petaluma Hill Road in 1868. The Barn is made 
entirely of redwood and has survived several 
major earthquakes with no damage. Richard’s 
son, Oliver, developed and began selling 
Crane Melons out of the Barn in the 1920’s.

E1152 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks September 1, 2017 

Today, the Crane family owns and operates 
Crane Canyon Ranch, The Crane Melon Barn 
and Crane Vineyard. In addition to their famous 
Crane Melons, the family ranch sells 
watermelons, heirloom tomatoes, Crane Melon 
Honey, organic Sonoma County walnuts and 
metal sculptures by Richard. Crane Vineyard 
is a four-acre pinot noir vineyard on the ranch. 
Rick and Jennifer are fifth and sixth generation 
Sonoma County farmers. 

The Crane family are active members of our 
community, with members serving on the 
Sonoma County Fair Board, Harvest Fair 
Board, Farm Bureau, 4–H Foundation Board 
and Farm Trails. 

The Santa Rosa Metro Chamber has recognized 
long-standing leadership in the community 
and successful maintenance of agricultural 
enterprises with its Leadership in Agriculture 
Award for over forty years. The Crane family 
is very deserving of this award. They work 
hard to develop excellent produce, serve our 
community, and maintain the great tradition of 
family farming in Sonoma County. 

Mr. Speaker, the Crane family has been 
farming in Sonoma County for six generations. 
They are leaders in sustainable farming and 
contribute honorably to our community. I am 
proud to have such a hardworking family living 
in our District. It is fitting and proper that we 
honor them here today.

EXPRESSING SOLIDARITY WITH 

THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS AF


FECTED BY HURRICANE HARVEY 

HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, September 1, 2017 

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
report to the House on Hurricane Harvey, the 
historic storm that has devastated the Gulf 
Coast and my city of Houston, Texas. 

As a senior member and a resident of the 
city of Houston, I was there and witnessed the 
devastation that the storm wrought. 

Hurricane Harvey has declared war on 
America’s Gulf Coast, and as Americans, we 
must respond. 

We will need emergency supplemental appropriations 
for Southeast Texas, and the 
Houston metroplex, to provide support to local, 
state, and federal government agencies in assisting 
with flood remediation, recovery, victim 
services, and reconstruction following the catastrophic 
damage caused by historic flooding. 

So far, Harvey has dumped an estimated 11 
trillion gallons of water in the Houston area. 

The relentless rain has inundated homes, 
decimated area roadways and turned neighborhoods 
into unrecognizable lakes. 

Large portions of the Bayou City have been 
overwhelmed by rainfall amounts that occur 
only once in every thousand years. 

To comprehend the level of destruction, the 
volume of water that has fallen could fill the 
Astrodome more than 24 thousand times over 
and power Niagara Falls for 15 days. 

The disastrous events this week have been 
punctuated by the tragic loss of life. 

In Houston, at least 44 people have lost 
their lives, including veteran police officer Sgt. 
Steve Perez, 60, who had worked for 34 years 
with the Houston Police Department. 

Sgt. Perez was trying to serve and protect 
others when he was swept away by the rising 
waters. 

Sgt. Perez, who worked in the traffic enforcement 
division, left home around 4 a.m. 
Sunday to drive to his duty station downtown 
but could not find a path because flooding 
caused by tropical storm Harvey had made 
many roads impassable. 

A family of six attempting to flee their home 
perished when their vehicle was swept into 
Greens Bayou. 

Samuel ‘‘Sammy’’ Saldivar was driving eastbound 
on Green River Road near John Ralston 
Road Sunday when rising water in 
Greens Bayou overcame the van. 

Sammy was travelling with his elderly parents, 
Manuel Saldivar, 84, and Belia, 81. 

Also in the van were the great-grandchildren 
of his parents: Daisy Saldivar, 6, Xavier 
Saldivar, 8, Dominic Saldivar, 14, and Devy 
Saldivar, 16. 

A Neither Houston nor any city in the nation 
has ever experienced flooding of this magnitude. 


Our valiant emergency responders are overtaxed 
and citizen rescues have become a critical 
source of assistance in saving lives. 

So far the Coast Guard alone has saved 
more than 6,000 Lives in Houston. 

At times like this, I am so proud to be an 
American and to call Houston home. 

We are a close community that comes together 
to overcome any challenge that stands 
in our way. 

Mr. Speaker, this is why we need Congress 
and the President to provide immediate emergency 
funding and resources commensurate 
with the crisis at hand, and that means a minimum 
of $150 billion is needed now and much 
more later. 

I ask the House to observe a moment of silence 
in memory of all those who perished in 
Hurricane Harvey.

HONORING MS. LEE PAULSEN 

HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY 

OF CONNECTICUT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, September 1, 2017 

Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Ms. Lee Paulsen, the Honorary 
Grand Marshal for the 56th Annual 
Labor Day Parade in Newtown, Connecticut. 
Since 1962, this annual celebration has 
brought together the people of Newtown and 
western Connecticut, and this year’s organizers 
invited Lee to head the parade in recognition 
of her decades of selfless work to 
help those most in need in our community. 

Lee moved to Newtown in 1972 with her 
family, and she quickly became known among 
her neighbors for her generosity. She has 
worked at the FAITH Food Pantry since its inception 
in 1983, and her efforts have been instrumental 
in keeping its doors open to those 
in need through economic downturns, the relocation 
of the food pantry, and other challenges 
facing the organization. 

Her neighbors in Newtown know Lee for her 
kindness, humility, and sincere commitment to 
helping others. Those who work with Lee note 
that she does not seek recognition or attention, 
but nonetheless, everyone knows Lee as 
an inspiring and altruistic person. The Labor 
Day Parade’s fitting theme, Labor of Love, this 
year recognizes Lee’s decades of work and 
encourages all of us to reflect on how we can 

contribute to our community. Lee sets a remarkable 
example as a caring citizen, and she 
has made Newtown a more generous and 
welcoming place through her years of work at 
FAITH. 

Mr. Speaker, Lee Paulsen has been a leading 
member of our community who shares her 
time and knowledge to help those in need in 
Newtown. Therefore, it is fitting and proper 
that we honor her here today, and thank her 
for inspiring others to engage in a Labor of 
Love.

L. RAFAEL REIF AND THE DEFERRED 
ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD 
ARRIVALS PROGRAM 
HON. MICHAEL E. CAPUANO 

OF MASSACHUSETTS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, September 1, 2017 

Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
share the powerful words of L. Rafael Reif, 
president of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, on DACA, ‘‘Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals.’’ Mr. Reif notes MIT’s commitment 
to intellectual excellence, merit, and 
national service in support of DACA. He is 
himself a proud naturalized citizen of the 
United States. 

[From the Boston Globe, Aug. 31, 2017] 

TRUMP SHOULD NOT REPEAL DACA 

(By L. Rafael Reif) 

President Trump is reportedly considering 
a repeal of ‘‘DACA,’’ the Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals program. The immediate 
pressure: a threat of legal action by a number 
of states to end the program, which sets 
a Sept. 5 deadline for the White House to act. 

As the president of one of America’s leading 
technical universities—an institution 
built on intellectual excellence, a 
meritocratic openness to talent, and a long 
tradition of national service—I believe repealing 
DACA would be a mistake. Repeal 
would be no more than a rejection of a policy 
and of thousands of human beings. Repeal is 
not, however, a solution for the country or 
for the young people directly involved. I 
strongly urge the president and Congress to 
find a path that better serves us all. 

Created in 2012 by executive action, DACA 
addresses the problem of young people 
brought to this country without documentation 
when they were under 16, a group sometimes 
known as Dreamers. DACA invites 
them to declare themselves openly to the 
government. In return, provided that they 
meet strict criteria, such as having earned a 
high school diploma, being enrolled in higher 
education or engaged in the military, and 
having committed no serious crime, DACA 
allows them a Social Security number, a 
driver’s license, authorization to work—and 
perhaps above all, relief from the fear of 
being deported. DACA is not a path to permanent 
citizenship; it grants a temporary 
but renewable opportunity for a normal life. 
And it applies only to the fixed pool of those 
who were brought to the US as children before 
June 2007. 

Repeal would run counter to our national 
interest in at least two ways. First, it would 
remove productive workers from our economy, 
while costing the US government tens 
of billions in lost future tax revenues and the 
direct costs of deportation. And because 
Dreamers are, by definition, products of the 
US education system, driving them out 
would be throwing away a tremendous national 
investment. We should treat these 


September 1, 2017 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1153 

educated, English-speaking strivers not as a 
burden, but as a resource. 

Repeal also strikes me as a violation of 
deep American principles. The plight of the 
Dreamers presents a profound question of 
fairness. Often starting from harsh personal 
circumstances, these young people have done 
what any American family might dream of 
for their child: Study hard, aim high, and 
earn a degree or a place in college or the 
military, on the road to a productive career. 
They are undocumented through no fault of 
their own. And when offered an opportunity 
to come out of the shadows, they did—because 
they trusted that our government 
would not punish them for it. 

Could we ask for more, from any American? 


Yet, as we see at MIT and at campuses 
across the country, the threat of DACA repeal 
is subjecting these young people to brutal 
uncertainty. Now, because of decisions 
made for them when they were children, 
they fear losing the opportunities they 
earned, the communities they think of as 
home, and the nation they love. 

The surest way to provide the certainty 
these students deserve is for Congress to pass 
legislation protecting these Dreamers. As 
many polls have found, the vast majority of 
Americans oppose repeal of DACA. And 
many members of Congress, on both sides of 
the aisle, have proposed humane and sensible 
legislative solutions. 

So I ask, in this urgent moment, that we 
unite as Americans in calling on Congress to 
bring a bill to the floor as soon as possible— 
and calling on Trump to allow Congress the 
time to get this right. 

I came to this country 43 years ago. The 
US immigration system worked well for me. 
It granted me a student visa and eventually 
a green card. Years later, on a beautiful day 
that I will never forget, I became an American 
citizen. I have the particular patriotism 
of an immigrant, rooted in deep gratitude 
and appreciation for a country founded on a 
dream of fairness. I urge Trump and the Congress 
to find a sound, stable legislative path 
to keep that promise if fairness for the 
Dreamers, too.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 75TH AN


NIVERSARY OF MARINES LAND


ING AT GUADALCANAL 

HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, September 1, 2017 

Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the 75th Anniversary of our United 
States Marines’ landing at Guadalcanal in the 
Solomon Islands during World War II. Three-
quarters of a century after this momentous 
event, the memory and sacrifice of these 
brave men should not be forgotten. 

On August 7, 1942, Marines joined by our 
allies landed on the shores of the Solomon Islands 
to deny their use to our then-adversary, 
Imperial Japan. These Marines were joined by 

U.S. Navy vessels, as well as by ships and 
troops supplied by our Australian and British 
allies, in a series of 26 land and naval battles 
that collectively became known as the Battle 
of Guadalcanal. Two of our future presidents 
served there: John F. Kennedy and Richard 
M. Nixon. Other Solomon Islanders served 
bravely as the famous Coastwatchers, providing 
the early warnings that allowed our outnumbered 
Marines to prevail against their enemies. 
Today, we look to the future with the 
knowledge that the Marines’ landing on this 
day three-quarters of a century ago was an 
important turning point in World War II’s Pacific 
Theater. 

To commemorate this important event, Marines 
and private citizens are currently in the 
process of dedicating a new monument atop 
the battlefield known as Bloody Ridge in Guadalcanal. 
Their efforts are supported and 
aided by the citizens and government of the 
Solomon Islands. The approaching ceremony 
to occur on the famous Bloody Ridge battle 
site recognizes the unity of spirit that today 
prevails among our allies and former adversaries, 
all of which are now charged with 
maintaining peace in the Pacific Ocean. 

Mr, Speaker, as the efforts to create a 
monument to the heroism displayed by so 
many at Guadalcanal move forward, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in remembering the 75th 
anniversary of our Marines’ historic landing at 
Guadalcanal.

HONORING SOPHIA BOQUIST 

HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, September 1, 2017 

Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Sophia Boquist for earning her 
Congressional Award Silver Medal. These 
awards are given to outstanding young individuals 
who meet specific standards for voluntary 
public service, personal development, physical 
fitness, and exploration. Sophia volunteered in 
a community award ceremony, cleaned a park 
trail, volunteered at the Travis Manion Foundation 
Heroes’ Run and worked as a volunteer 
aide at the Ivy Hill Therapeutic Equestrian 
Center. Additionally, Sophia spent time developing 
her ability as a pianist and her skill as 
a diver. As a final step, Sophia showed great 
leadership in planning and executing a two-
day canoe trip down the Delaware River. 
Sophia’s commitment to public service and 
motivation to better herself should serve as an 
example to all of us.

IN SUPPORT OF H. RES. 274 

HON. TED LIEU 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, September 1, 2017 

Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to highlight the Baha’i Faith as Iran’s largest 
religious minority group which has been 
subjected to state-sponsored persecution that 
has intensified since the Islamic Revolution of 
1979. State-sponsored media has disseminated 
over 1,500 anti-Baha’i pieces every 
month in 2016, inciting hatred against the 
Baha’i community. 

After Baha’is were barred from attending or 
teaching in Iranian universities, the Baha’i Institute 
for Higher Education (BIHE), an informal 
higher education system, was created in 
1987 by members of the Baha’i community in 
Iran. In recent years, faculty and staff have 
been arrested and imprisoned for their participation 
in BIHE. 

We must be very clear that education is not 
a crime. In any diplomatic engagement with 

Iran, I urge the administration to make human 
rights and religious freedom, including the persecuted 
Baha’is, an integral part of the dialogue. 


I fully support House Resolution 274, which 
condemns the government of Iran’s state 
sponsored persecution of its Baha’i minority 
and its continued violation of the International 
Covenants on Human Rights.

REMEMBERING JOSEPH CALABRIA 

HON. DANIEL M. DONOVAN, JR. 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, September 1, 2017 

Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in memory 
of Staten Island’s Joseph Calabria, who 
passed away on July 28, 2017, at the age of 
86. 

A lifelong New Yorker, Joseph grew up in 
Brooklyn where he met his childhood sweetheart 
Josephine at a dance hall on Coney Island, 
whom he married in 1957. He nobly 
fought for his country during the Korean War. 
After joining the Army in October 1951, Joseph 
was responsible for delivering supplies 
and munitions to his fellow soldiers. When the 
war ended, he served his country further by 
tirelessly advocating for veterans. 

As the former Commander of the local Korean 
War Veterans chapter, Joseph never 
stopped fighting for his brothers who wore the 
uniform. He was instrumental in changing the 
name of the Richmond Parkway to the Korean 
War Veterans Parkway. Moreover, he was influential 
in renaming P.S. 6 after Corporal 
Allan F. Kivlehan. These were no small feats, 
but Joseph never grew tired of fighting for 
those who put their life on the line for their 
country. 

Joseph was also proud of his blue-collar 
roots. Working as a longshoreman for over 
forty years, he showed his compassion for the 
fellow working man by supporting them as a 
delegate for Local 856. Furthermore, Joseph 
was also a loving father to four wonderful children 
and a devoted grandfather to two. 

Mr. Speaker, Joseph Calabria has spent his 
life in service to veterans, community, and 
country. I am saddened that he is no longer 
with us, but I know his compassion and patriotism 
will live on. He led a selfless life and for 
that, I salute him.

Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to

recent appointment to the North Carolina State 
Board of Community Colleges and the North

Currently practicing law at Moretz & 
Skufca, Ms. Benbow focuses on technology 
transfer, licensing, corporate matters and distillery 
& brewery law while simultaneously 
serving on the Rowan-Cabarrus College Board 
of Trustees. Prior to her legal work, she

REMEMBERING MR. MARIO 
GUTIERREZ 

HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Friday, September 1, 2017 

Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, it is with profound 
sadness that I rise to honor the life of 
Mr. Mario Gutierrez. I ask my colleagues to 
join me in tribute to Mario’s truly remarkable 
life. His work has saved countless lives, and 
there will be a significant void without him. 

Mario’s impact on telehealth is immeasurable. 
His work at CCHP has profoundly impacted 
the telehealth policy landscape on both 
the state and federal level. He served as a 
program director with The California Endowment 
for twelve years and as a senior program 
officer with The Sierra Health Foundation 
for six years. Mario always viewed telehealth 
as a means to ultimately achieve what 
he firmly believed and fought to accomplish: to 
make sure that every person, no matter how 
poor or how isolated, could access high-quality 
healthcare. 

Mario’s work researching and supporting 
telehealth innovations has helped children in 
remote rural communities receive life-saving 
treatment from world-renowned physicians, 
and has explored the potential of connecting 
health care providers in Mexico with undocumented 
individuals needing care in California. 
Mario and his wife would often spearhead and 
lead medical missions to other countries to 
provide medical care for people in need, who 
may have never otherwise received vital medical 
treatment. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in celebrating the life of Mr. Mario Gutierrez 
and in offering our condolences to his wife, 
family, and colleagues. His life’s work will continue 
to improve the lives of so many people 
and those who knew him will truly miss him.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Daniel P. 
Coughlin, offered the following prayer: 
Praise the Lord, as servants of the 
Lord, let us praise the name of the 
Lord together. 
From the rising of the Sun in the 
east to its setting in the west may 
praise of the Lord for blessings be 
heard from coast to coast. Our God, 
who is above all the nations of the 
Earth does not overlook the most 
lowly or the most unfortunate in this 
world. 
The Lord’s greatness does not distance 
the Lord from His people. Our 
God is to be found always in their 
midst. 
None is like the Lord in love and concern. 
That is why the Lord is the model 
and the guide of the Members of this 
House and all public servants everywhere. 
The Lord lifts up the weak to confront 
the proud-hearted and raises the 
poor to equal status with the powerful. 
The Lord is mindful always that parents 
are the most powerful on Earth 
over their children, yet all are one in 
His sight. 
For all the great deeds of mercy, let 
us praise the name of the Lord now and 
forever. Amen.

character. 

‘‘(2) FUNDS NOT AID TO RELIGION.—Federal, 
State, or local government funds or other assistance 
that is received by a religious organization 
for the provision of services under 
this section constitutes aid to individuals

entity shall provide to such individual 
(if otherwise eligible for such assistance) 
within a reasonable period of time 
after the date of such objection, assistance 
that— 

‘‘(A) is an alternative that is accessible to 
the individual and unobjectionable to the individual 
on religious grounds; and 

‘‘(B) has a value that is not less than the 
value of the assistance that the individual 
would have received from such organization.

State, or local governmental entity shall 
guarantee that notice is provided to the individuals 
described in paragraph (3) of the 
rights of such individuals under this section.

described in this paragraph is an individual 
who receives or applies for assistance under

A religious organization providing 
assistance through a grant or cooperative 
agreement under a program described in subsection 
(c)(4) shall not discriminate in carrying 
out the program against an individual 
described in subsection (g)(3) on the basis of 
religion, a religious belief, or a refusal to 
hold a religious belief. 

‘‘(2) INDIRECT FORMS OF ASSISTANCE.—A religious 
organization providing assistance 
through a voucher, certificate, or other form 
of indirect assistance under a program described 
in subsection (c)(4) shall not deny an 
individual described in subsection (g)(3) admission 
into such program on the basis of religion, 
a religious belief, or a refusal to hold 
a religious belief. 

‘‘(i) ACCOUNTABILITY.— 

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in 
paragraphs (2) and (3), a religious organization 
providing assistance under any program 
described in subsection (c)(4) shall be subject 
to the same regulations as other nongovernmental 
organizations to account in accord 
with generally accepted accounting principles 
for the use of such funds and its performance 
of such programs. 

‘‘(2) LIMITED AUDIT.— 

‘‘(A) GRANTS AND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS.—
A religious organization providing 
assistance through a grant or cooperative 
agreement under a program described in subsection 
(c)(4) shall segregate government 
funds provided under such program into a 
separate account or accounts. Only the separate 
accounts consisting of funds from the 
government shall be subject to audit by the 
government. 

‘‘(B) INDIRECT FORMS OF ASSISTANCE.—A religious 
organization providing assistance 
through a voucher, certificate, or other form 
of indirect assistance under a program described 
in subsection (c)(4) may segregate 
government funds provided under such program 
into a separate account or accounts. If 
such funds are so segregated, then only the 
separate accounts consisting of funds from 
the government shall be subject to audit by 
the government. 

‘‘(3) SELF AUDIT.—A religious organization 
providing services under any program described 
in subsection (c)(4) shall conduct annually 
a self audit for compliance with its 
duties under this section and submit a copy

TARINESS.—No funds provided through a 
grant or cooperative agreement to a religious 
organization to provide assistance 
under any program described in subsection 
(c)(4) shall be expended for sectarian instruction, 
worship, or proselytization. If the religious 
organization offers such an activity, it 
shall be voluntary for the individuals receiving 
services and offered separate from the 
program funded under subsection (c)(4). A 
certificate shall be separately signed by religious 
organizations, and filed with the government 
agency that disburses the funds, 
certifying that the organization is aware of 
and will comply with this subsection. 

‘‘(k) EFFECT ON STATE AND LOCAL FUNDS.— 
If a State or local government contributes 

State or local funds to carry out a program 
described in subsection (c)(4), the State or 
local government may segregate the State or 
local funds from the Federal funds provided 
to carry out the program or may commingle 
the State or local funds with the Federal 
funds. If the State or local government commingles 
the State or local funds, the provisions 
of this section shall apply to the commingled 
funds in the same manner, and to 
the same extent, as the provisions apply to 
the Federal funds. 

‘‘(l) INDIRECT ASSISTANCE.—When consistent

in subsection (c)(4), the Secretary of 
the department administering the program 
may direct the disbursement of some or all 
of the funds, if determined by the Secretary

assistance. For purposes of this section, 
‘indirect assistance’ constitutes assistance 
in which an organization receiving 
funds through a voucher, certificate, or 
other form of disbursement under this section 
receives such funding only as a result of 
the private choices of individual beneficiaries 
and no government endorsement of 
any particular religion, or of religion generally, 
occurs.

GRANTORS.—If a nongovernmental organization 
(referred to in this subsection as an ‘intermediate

other agreement with the Federal Government, 
or a State or local government with 
Federal funds, is given the authority under 
the agreement to select nongovernmental organizations 
to provide assistance under the 
programs described in subsection (c)(4), the 
intermediate grantor shall have the same duties 
under this section as the government 
when selecting or otherwise dealing with 
subgrantors, but the intermediate grantor, if 
it is a religious organization, shall retain all 
other rights of a religious organization under 
this section. 

‘‘(n) COMPLIANCE.—A party alleging that 
the rights of the party under this section 
have been violated by a State or local government 
may bring a civil action for injunctive 
relief pursuant to section 1979 against

that has allegedly committed such violation. 
A party alleging that the rights of the 
party under this section have been violated 
by the Federal Government may bring a civil 
action for injunctive relief in Federal district

agency that has allegedly committed

the Honorable JON KYL, a Senator 
from the State of Arizona. 

PRAYER 

The Chaplain, Dr. Lloyd John 
Ogilvie, offered the following prayer: 

Gracious God, thank You for this moment 
of prayer in which we can affirm 
Your call to seek unity in the midst of 
differences in the parties and politics. 
So often we focus on what separates us 
rather than the bond of unity that 
binds us together. We are one in our 
calling to serve You and our Nation 
and in the belief that You are the ultimate 
and only sovereign. You are the 
magnetic and majestic Lord of all who 
draws us out of pride and self-serving 
attitudes to work together for You. We 
find each other as we join our hearts in 
gratitude for the privilege of leading 
our Nation. Keep us so close to You and 
so open to one another that this will be 
a week of great progress. Help us to 
work expeditiously and with excellence 
for Your glory and our Nation’s good. 
Through our Lord and Saviour. Amen.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Under the previous order the Senate 
will now proceed to the consideration 
of H.R. 2311, which the clerk will 
report. 

The assistant legislative clerk read 
as follows: 

A bill (H.R. 2311) making appropriations

SCHEDULE 
Mr. REID. As has been announced by 
the Chair, the Senate will begin consideration 
of the energy and water appropriations 
bill. Today will be for debate 
only. There will be no rollcall votes 
today. The next vote is expected tomorrow 
at approximately 12 noon on 
cloture on the substitute amendment 
to the Bankruptcy Reform Act. I am to 
remind everyone that there is a 3 p.m. 
filing deadline for first-degree amendments 
to the bankruptcy reform substitute 
amendment. 
We hope to complete action on the 
energy and water appropriations bill, 
the transportation appropriations bill, 
and/or the legislative branch appropriations 
bill before the end of this week. 
I would say to all those listening, it 
is going to be extremely difficult to do 
that, but we can do it. There are only 
a few issues on the energy and water 

appropriations bill. We hope to resolve 
those so it does not take a lot of time. 
And then, of course, the appropriations 
bill dealing with transportation has in 
the last few years gone quite rapidly, 
and we hope it will again this year. 

We are not in a position at this time, 
Senator DOMENICI and I, to offer a 
unanimous consent agreement as to 
when the amendments to the energy 
and water appropriations bill should be 
filed, but we are going to work on that. 
Senator DOMENICI is indisposed for the 
next hour and a half or so. But we expect 
him to be here at 3:30 today, at 
which time we will begin opening 
statements on the energy and water 
appropriations bill. 

f 


MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. REID. I see my friend from Iowa 
here. Does he wish to speak on the bill 
or as if in morning business? 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Morning business. 
Mr. REID. Certainly I would have no 
problem asking unanimous consent. As 
I said, Senator DOMENICI is indisposed 
now for the next hour or so. So what 
time does the Senator from Iowa expect 
to use? 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I would expect to be 
done by 2:30. 
Mr. REID. Fine. I ask unanimous 
consent, Mr. President, the Senator 
from Iowa be recognized for 30 minutes 
to speak in morning business. When he 
completes his work, we will return to 
the energy and water appropriations 
bill. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Iowa is recognized.

S7658 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

by the Congress of the United States 
and signed by the President on June 7 
and will be the reason that tax rebate 
checks will go out, distributing $65 billion 
of overtaxation to the American 
people—back to the American people 
so they can spend it, so it will do more 
economic good than if it is politically 
distributed here in Washington, DC. 

That bill not only has the $65 billion 
of tax refunds that will start going out 
next week and be out by September 30, 
but it already has reductions for other 
rates. The tax rebates come from the 
new 10-percent rate that is going into 
effect retroactive to January 1. It is 
my understanding there will be about 
90 million Americans who will be getting 
rebates of up to $300 if they are 
single, $500 if they are a single parent, 
and also then up to $600 if they are 
married. 

Also, remember that this is not a 
one-shot rate reduction, or tax rebate; 
that these rebates, even though they 
will never be received in a check again, 
will continue on into the future as permanent 
reductions in taxation for people 
in the 10-percent bracket. And also 
remember that everybody who pays 
taxes would pay some of that 10-percent 
bracket so that it does affect all 
taxpayers. But checks are going out for 
those up to the amount of $12,000 of 
taxable income. 

I think this tax bill is going to make 
real changes in the lives of folks across 
our country. The changes I am going to 
discuss today result in the greatest tax 
relief provided in a generation—tax relief, 
I might add, powerfully brought 
about in a bipartisan consensus. 

Some might ask, Why talk about 
something we have already done? The 
answer is that the legislation is quite 
comprehensive and to do it justice we 
really need to take a thorough and methodical 
look at it—not look at it just 
from the standpoint of the rebate 
checks that are going out, which are 
getting all the attention, but all the 
other aspects of the bill as well. 

It is true there have been a lot of 
press reports on this legislation. Again, 
most of those have been related to the 
rebate checks going out starting next 
week. None of these reports, however, I 
believe, in the press has really tied the 
specific benefits of the bill back to its 
bipartisan purpose. 

Also, the press reports have tended to 
analyze the bill in terms of its impact 
on certain types of taxpayers. At the 
same time, many press reports have focused 
exclusively on the budget angle 
of the tax legislation; in other words, 
people nervous, tearing out their hair 
because there is going to be less money 
coming into the Federal Treasury as a 
result of our letting the people keep 
their tax overpayment. 

These reports that tend to be very 
pessimistic often echo the sentiments 
of the harshest congressional critics of 
the legislation. These reports, like the 
congressional critics of this bill—and 
probably for the most part those who 
voted against it—tend to ignore the 

benefits of the bill. Tax relief legislation 
is just not more money in the taxpayers’ 
pockets in some selfish way 
that you let the taxpayers keep more 
of their money. There is great economic 
good that comes from the distribution 
of goods and services in this 
economy based upon an individual 
making that decision as opposed to a 
political leader in Washington, DC, 
making that decision through the Federal 
budget. 

Now, of course, all of this criticism is 
fair play in the arena of politics. However, 
in recent weeks it seems to me 
these arguments have not been answered 
with the same vigor by the 
strong bipartisan majority of us who 
supported the legislation. So today I 
take the floor to set the record 
straight. Tax relief is absolutely necessary. 
Tax relief legislation is an important 
vehicle in response to our 
short-term and long-term economic 
situations. And that is basically a flat 
economy—1 to 1.5-percent growth instead 
of the 2-percent growth we projected 
a year ago, 1 to 1.5-percent economic 
growth under the last two quarters 
of the Clinton administration, and 
carrying through to the first two quarters 
of President Bush’s administration. 


That is a situation where we have 
these checks going out, a short-term 
stimulus, which, if we had not done it, 
would have had 100 Senators sitting 
around this body scratching their 
heads and deploring the fact that we 
had a flat economy. So what can we do 
about it? 

Congress has passed tax reduction in 
the past to stimulate the economy but 
often taking effect after the economy 
turned around. It tended not to be as 
beneficial as it would have been if it 
had been done at the right time. 

I do not want to take credit for having 
been a leader in the tax rebates, 
knowing that they were going to be 
needed now as a stimulus. I confess not 
to have thought that way last March 
and April when we started working on 
tax relief. But we ended up with tax rebates—$
65 billion—and most economists 
are saying they could not have 
come at a more opportune time for an 
economy that is flat and in need of 
some stimulus. 

There are three reasons for this bipartisan 
tax relief package. One is that 
it is necessary, when the Federal Government 
overtaxes people, to reduce 
taxes so that there is not overtaxation. 

No. 2, it is necessary to respond to 
the current and long-term economic 
problems. I talked about the short-
term stimulus, but there are long-term 
economic benefits from this bill that 
are going to enhance the economy. 

Third, there is sufficient surplus outside 
Social Security and Medicare that 
is still available to accomplish a tax 
cut that addresses certain inequities in 
the Tax Code, such as the marriage 
penalty. 

I will start with reason No. 1, that 
the tax cut corrected overtaxation. Be


fore the tax cut, the Federal Government 
was collecting too much tax. The 
Federal Government was on a path to 
accumulate over $3.1 trillion in excess 
tax collections over the next 10 years. 
Federal tax receipts were at their highest 
level in our Nation’s history. 

The bulk of these excess collections 
came from the individual income-tax 
payer. Individual income tax collections 
were near an all-time high, even 
higher than some levels imposed by 
World War II. 

The chart I have in the Chamber 
demonstrates this better than I can, 
how, since 1960, we have seen very high 
income taxation. In this particular 
case, we are seeing taxes, as a whole, 
collected by the Federal Government, 
not just the income taxes but everything 
at the highest level by the year 
2000 at 20.6 percent of gross national 
product. 

This chart shows total tax receipts as 
a percentage of gross domestic product 
over 40 years. Tax receipts have naturally 
fluctuated frequently since 1960, 
but most shockingly they spike up 
since the tax bill of 1993. 

The January 2001 Congressional 
Budget Office report to Congress shows 
that in 1992, total tax receipts were 
around 17 percent of gross domestic 
product. As I said, by the year 2000, 
they were at 20.6 percent. The significance 
of this percentage can only be 
appreciated in the historical comparisons 
to which I have already referred. 
But I want to be more specific. 

In 1944, at the height of World War II, 
taxes, as a percentage of gross domestic 
product, were 20.9 percent—only .5 
percent higher than they are today. By 
1945, those taxes had dropped to 20.4 
percent of GDP, which is actually 
lower than the collection level today. 

It is unbelievable that in a time of 
unprecedented peace and prosperity, 
which defines the last decade, the Federal 
Government would rake in taxes 
at a wartime level. The sorriest part of 
this whole story is that this huge increase 
in taxes has been borne almost 
exclusively by the American people 
who pay the individual Federal income 
tax. 

I have another chart which shows tax 
collection levels for payroll taxes, corporate 
taxes, and all other taxes over 
the past decade. It shows they have 
been relatively stable. Corporate taxes, 
during the past 10 years, have increased 
from 1.6 percent of GDP to 2.1 
percent of GDP. Estate taxes have remained 
relatively stable over that period 
of time. 

However, collection of individual income 
taxes by the Federal Government 
has soared. There was a 50-percent increase 
during that period of time: 7.7 
percent of gross domestic product in 
1992 to 10.2 percent of gross domestic 
product as of the year 2000. 

Individual income taxes now take up 
the largest share of GDP in the history 
of the individual income tax. And that 
dates back to 1916, except for the Civil 
War when there was one that the 
courts declared unconstitutional. 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7659 

Even during World War II collections 
from individuals were 9.4 percent. So 
you see it was a full percentage point 
below what they are today in peacetime. 
As you can see, the source of current 
and future surpluses is from a 
huge runup in individual income tax 
collections, and not in runups in any 
other form of taxes and levies that the 
Federal Government makes on the taxpayers 
of this country or the businesses 
of this country. 

Part of this is because the 1993 Clinton 
tax increase overshot its mark. 
These excess collections are attributable 
to that enactment, in August 
1993, of the largest tax increase in the 
history of the world. 

Since 1992, total personal income has 
grown an average of 5.6 percent. Federal 
income tax collections, however, 
have grown an average of 9.1 percent a 
year, outstripping the rate of personal 
income growth by 64 percent. 

The Joint Committee on Taxation, at 
the request of the Joint Economic 
Committee of the Congress, estimated 
that just repealing the revenue-raising 
provisions of President Clinton’s 1993 
biggest-in-the-world tax hike would 
yield tax relief of more than $1 trillion 
over 10 years. 

We ought to take a closer look at 
that 1993 world’s biggest tax increase. 
The 39.6-percent top bracket reflected a 
10-percent surcharge on the basic 36percent 
rate. The itemized deductions 
you can subtract from your taxable income, 
known as the Pease Rule, and 
the phaseout of personal exemptions, 
which we refer to as PEP, the personal 
exemption phaseout, were temporary 
bipartisan deficit reduction provisions 
that were made permanent under the 
1993 tax hike. 

So remember, you had a top marginal 
tax rate of 36. That was meant to be 
permanent. But you had a temporary 
10 percent put on top of that, bringing 
that to 36.9 percent. Yet for higher 
brackets they wanted to camouflage it. 
We had a phaseout of exemptions so 
that higher income people did not get 
the full advantage of the personal exemption, 
as an example, which ought 
to tell you that in a time of budget surpluses, 
which we are in right now, anybody 
who was intellectually honest 
about putting a 10-percent surtax on 
the basic 36-percent rate just to get rid 
of the annual budget deficit ought to 
take that 10-percent rate off. But, no, 
it was never done by those who proposed 
it and those who did it. We did it 
through the gradual reduction of the 
rates that were in the bill signed by 
the President June 7. 

The chairman of the Finance Committee 
at the time of the 1993 Clinton 
tax increase actually called this what I 
have already referred to as—‘‘a world 
record tax hike.’’ Obviously, with income 
tax collections as high as they 
have ever been in the history of the 
country, we know that to be a fact. 

The rationale for the tax increases 
was deficit reduction. It is reasonable 
to think that if deficit reduction was a 

reason for raising taxes to record levels, 
then in the era of surpluses we are 
in now, those tax overcharges, those 
tax overpayments, should be left with 
the taxpayers of America, not run 
through the Federal budget anymore, 
for two reasons: No. 1, because they are 
not needed, once you balance the budget; 
and, No. 2, if I distribute that income 
of the hard-working men and 
women in America, it doesn’t turn over 
in the economy as much as if they keep 
it and spend it or invest it. 

That is what creates jobs; they create 
wealth. We in the Federal Government 
don’t create wealth; we only expend 
the wealth created by others. 

This year, on a bipartisan basis, Congress 
did just that through the tax bill 
signed by President Bush on June 7. We 
are going to let you keep your money 
because we believe it does more economic 
good, it creates more wealth if 
you have it than if we have it. 

Congress then agreed to return a portion 
of the record level of taxes back to 
the taxpayers and, in a sense, Congress, 
on party-line vote in 1993—and it was a 
party-line vote—raised taxes too much. 
And this year, on a bipartisan basis— 
not a party-line vote but on a bipartisan 
basis—we corrected that overtaxation 
and that temporary taxation 
that was put in place in 1993. 

Democrats and Republicans, led by 
President Bush, started with the fact 
that the 1993 tax hike took too much 
from the American taxpayers and the 
American economy. President Bush offered 
to reduce individual tax rates 
across all rate brackets and to reduce 
the number of brackets. 

Congress changed aspects of the 
President’s plan and, from my point of 
view, improved the President’s plan as 
it made its way through Congress. The 
bill the President signed did contain 
relief for taxpayers in all tax brackets. 
This benefits all taxpayers across 
America. 

There is much wringing of hands and 
gnashing of teeth over the fiscal impact 
of that tax relief package. We hear 
it daily from the leadership on the 
other side and from many in the media. 
What you don’t hear about is how close 
everyone in the Senate was on the size 
of the tax cut. In other words, for those 
who voted against the tax cut, there 
was just a little bit of difference between 
what Republicans and a bipartisan 
group of Members of this body 
thought ought to be cut at a higher 
level versus what everybody else, on 
mostly a partisan basis, thought we 
ought to cut taxes—just a little bit of 
difference. 

For the record, everyone on the other 
side of the aisle who opposed the bipartisan 
tax relief package had already 
voted for over $1.25 trillion of tax relief. 
Some of those people who voted 
that way are the very same ones who 
are saying we cut taxes too much. I 
hope you remember that on the debate 
on the tax bill, everyone on the other 
side, including every Member of the 
Democratic leadership, including the 

present chairman of the Budget Committee, 
the Senator from North Dakota, 
voted for $1.25 trillion in tax relief. 
Yet they are now saying we 
shouldn’t have this tax cut. 

For instance, we had a vote on what 
was called the Carnahan-Daschle 
Democratic substitute. That amendment, 
if it had passed, would have represented 
tax cuts of that $1.25 trillion I 
cited. 

I raise this point for two reasons: 
One, to make the record clear on the 
votes on the tax cut bill; and two, to 
make an even more fundamental point. 
That fundamental point is, despite all 
the rhetoric, there was widespread support 
for significant across-the-board relief 
even among the most critical of 
the final tax package. 

Let me repeat reason No. 1 for this 
tax cut before I go on to reason No. 2. 
The American people are overtaxed. 
The American people have paid a tax 
surplus into the Federal Treasury. The 
goal is to let the taxpayers distribute 
those goods and services as opposed to 
having 100 Senators distribute that 
money. 

Now reason No. 2: The tax cut is 
needed to reverse slow growth in the 
economy, not only slow growth long 
term but I have already referred to the 
slow growth that has happened right 
now over the last four quarters, 1- to 
1.5-percent growth instead of 2.5-percent 
as we had projected. 

I provided you with the first reason, 
to correct overtaxation. Now for the 
second one. 

It is our responsibility to help the 
folks back home who are facing a slower 
economy to create jobs, to expand 
the economy. There has been a slowdown 
since the latter half of the year 
2000. I will expand on the point that the 
economic slowdown did start in the latter 
part of 2000. 

We have two charts. The first chart 
shows that economic growth has 
slowed considerably since the middle of 
last year. In the last two quarters of 
the Clinton administration, it started 
to slow. Compared to the average 4-percent 
growth rate since 1998, the economy 
grew only a little over 1 percent. 

Several factors have contributed to 
the economic slowdown. For the two 
previous years, we had a tighter monetary 
policy by the Federal Reserve. We 
had Chairman Greenspan throw out of 
the window his very comprehensive 
program of liquidity from 1988 until 
1995, and then he started worrying 
about inflation. Worrying about inflation 
so much, he tightened up money 
so that we didn’t have enough liquidity. 
When he gets back on the kick of 
worrying about liquidity, not worrying 
about inflation, the monetary policy 
will turn it around. But a tighter monetary 
policy has brought about this 
slowdown. We have also had the rising 
energy rates, a decline in the stock 
market, and we have had rising tax 
burdens. 

The economic slowdown has real impact 
on working Americans, as evidenced 
by this second chart we have 


S7660 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

here, as you have seen the unemployment 
rate go up. It shows that the unemployment 
rate had fallen steadily, 
but since the slowdown began last 
year, the unemployment rate has risen. 
It is now at 41/2 percent, the same level 
it was in October 1998. 

Although there is still considerable 
uncertainty about the economy, a 
number of factors seem to point in the 
right direction, and one is there is 
some reversal of the Federal Reserve 
on its monetary policy. We have had 
energy prices stabilize. For instance, a 
week ago last weekend, I bought gas in 
Cedar Falls, IA, at $1.19 a gallon. 

Given the continued pessimism on 
Wall Street, however, the economy remains 
vulnerable to potential shocks. 
So we should continue to monitor signs 
of potential trouble ahead and be prepared 
to take additional steps should 
they become necessary. Republicans 
and Democrats have a responsibility to 
address this problem. 

There is some speculation by some on 
my side of the aisle that those on the 
other side are hoping the recession 
comes about for political reasons. I disagree 
with that speculation. I believe 
everyone here wants to get the economy 
on a steady path. Everyone knows 
that the worst thing you can do in an 
economic downturn is to raise taxes. 
On the other hand, a tax cut is a stimulus 
to economic activity. So if your 
goal were to further slow down the 
economy, one sure way to do it would 
be to raise taxes. On the other hand, if 
you see a slowdown coming, a tax cut 
would be a wise response to get the 
economy growing again. 

In other words, if we had not cut 
taxes, not had these rebate checks 
going out, we would be nervously trying 
to cut taxes to stimulate the economy. 
A tax cut stimulates economic 
growth in two ways. First is to the extent 
the tax cut currently provides 
more money for consumers to spend, it 
creates more demands for goods and 
services. Secondly, and most impor


tantly, the tax cut stimulates the 
economy through changes in expectations 
for workers, investors, and businesses. 
In other words, a lower tax bite 
means that workers, investors, and 
businesses can expect to retain more of 
the income generated by their activities. 
That expectation will change 
what workers and investors and businesses 
do right now. That does more 
economic good than if we have a political 
decision to distribute the goods 
and services. 

Chairman Alan Greenspan and others 
have alluded to a new form of ‘‘bracket 
creep’’ brought about by high tax 
rates. In a sense, through this new 
form of bracket creep, the Federal Government 
was getting a windfall from 
workers, investors, and businesses. 

With the lower marginal tax rates, 
some of the damaging bracket creep 
has been eliminated over the long 
term. That change should free up more 
income to flow through the marketplace 
and stimulate the economy. 

So it was pretty clear some action 
needed to be taken to stimulate the 
economy. Action was taken and now, 
hopefully, for the folks back home, the 
economy will start to grow significantly. 


Now if I can go to the third and last 
reason why the tax bill needed to be 
passed—the issue of fairness. We heard 
during the debate, and even recently, a 
hue and cry from some on the other 
side of the aisle that not all taxpayers 
should receive a rate reduction. They 
said the bipartisan tax relief bill that 
was signed by the President disproportionately 
benefits upper income taxpayers 
and does not provide enough relief 
at the lower income scale. 

Well, we have news for that group of 
people. None of those allegations is 
true, and the charts that I have will 
show that. But we first need to understand 
the current distribution of tax 
burdens in America. We already have a 
highly progressive income tax system. 
According to the Congressional Budget 

Office, the top 20 percent of income 
taxpayers pay over 75 percent of all the 
income taxes coming into the Federal 
Government. By contrast, households 
in the bottom three-fifths of the income 
distribution pay 7 percent of all 
individual taxes. 

Sometimes I get the feeling around 
here that when it comes to progressivity, 
the only way it is going to satisfy 
anybody here is if the richest man 
in America is supporting the Federal 
Government totally. But for those who 
are worried about this tax bill not 
being progressive enough, it not only 
preserves an already progressive system; 
it actually makes it more progressive. 
Those who don’t like progressive 
income tax systems don’t like to hear 
me say that. But for those who say our 
tax bill has made it less progressive, I 
hope it causes them to keep their 
mouths shut. 

So to all who are critical of the bipartisan 
tax relief package as a tax cut 
for the rich, I invite them to pay special 
attention to data prepared by a 
neutral source, the Joint Committee 
on Taxation. These professionals work 
for both sides of the aisle, Republicans 
and Democrats, and for both the House 
and the Senate. As the Joint Committee 
on Taxation says, the marginal 
tax rate reductions in our bill, as 
signed by the President, combined with 
the increase in the child credit, and its 
added refundability, the marriage penalty, 
the education provisions, and the 
individual retirement accounts and 
pension provisions—all these aspects of 
this bill provide the greatest reduction 
in tax burden for the lower income taxpayer. 


I ask unanimous consent that the tables 
prepared by the Joint Committee 
on Taxation be printed in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

1 Includes provisions affecting the child credit, individual marginal rates, a 10% bracket, limitation of itemized deductions, the personal exemption phaseout, the standard deduction, 15% bracket and EIC for married couples, deductible 
IRAs, and the AMT. 

2 The income concept used to place tax returns into income categories is adjusted gross income (AGI) plus; [1] tax-exempt interest, [2] employer contributions for health plans and life insurance, [3] employer share of FICA tax, [4] worker’s 
compensation, [5] nontaxable Social Security benefits, [6] insurance value of Medicare benefits, [7] alternative minimum tax preference items, and [8] excluded income of U.S. citizens living abroad. Categories are measured at 2001 
levels. 

3 Federal taxes are equal to individual income tax (including the outlay portion of the EIC), employment tax (attributed to employees), and excise taxes (attributed to consumers). Corporate income tax and estate and gift taxes are not 
included due to uncertainty concerning the incidence of these taxes. Individuals who are dependents of other taxpayers and taxpayers with negative income are excluded from the analysis. Does not include indirect effects. 

4 The effective tax rate is equal to Federal taxes described in footnote (3) divided by: income described in footnote (2) plus additional income attributable to the proposal.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will 
go to a couple of the charts I referred 
to prepared by Joint Tax. Look at the 
levels of reduction in tax burden shown 
on this chart. You can see that the lowest 
income brackets receive the highest 
reduction. 

Now, for the year 2006—and I say for 
the year 2006 because that is when the 
individual tax provisions or rates are 
implemented—taxpayers with over 
$100,000 of income receive a tax cut of 
between 5 and 6 percent. Taxpayers 
earning between $10,000 and $50,000 get 
a tax cut of between 6.5 percent and 

13.6 percent, with those at the lower income 
levels getting the biggest percentage 
of reduction. Even those with 
incomes below $10,000, who, by and 
large, don’t pay income and payroll 
taxes, receive a tax cut under the bipartisan 
tax relief package. 
Under the tax relief, 6 million Americans 
will be taken off the income tax 
rolls. Those are lower bracket people. 
Just tell 6 million people who are never 
going to be paying income tax in the 
future that they aren’t getting a benefit 
from this greater than higher income 
people who are going to be paying 

income taxes the rest of their lives. A 
four-person family earning $35,000 a 
year will no longer have any income 
tax burden. 

As the Joint Tax data also shows, a 
large reduction of the tax burden is 
targeted toward taxpayers between the 
$30,000 and $75,000 income brackets. 
These taxpayers will enjoy significant 
effective tax relief. 

I also said that the bipartisan tax relief 
actually makes our tax system 
more progressive. The Joint Tax Committee 
again provides the proof. As the 
Joint Tax tables demonstrate, under 
the bipartisan tax relief package, the 
overall burden goes down for taxpayers 
earning below $100,000. For taxpayers 
making $100,000 or more, however, their 
share of the Federal tax burden will actually 
increase under the bipartisan 
tax relief legislation. For example, for 
taxpayers earning between $100,000 and 
$200,000 a year, their share of the burden 
will increase by three-tenths of a 
percent. This is not the case for taxpayers 
earning between $10,000 and 
$30,000. Their share of the overall burden 
will decrease by three-tenths of a 
percentage point. 

So the bipartisan tax relief legislation 
not only retains the progressivity 
of the tax system, but that progressivity 
is enhanced. 

Now, it is clear that distribution tables 
aren’t the only way to define tax 
fairness. There were other categories of 
tax relief that carried bipartisan priority 
in terms of fairness. First, on a 
bipartisan basis, there is concern about 
the added burden for couples who decide 
to marry. This important social 
objective was impaired by the marriage 
penalty. The bipartisan tax relief legislation 
provided marriage tax relief. 

Second, on a bipartisan basis, there 
was concern about the Tax Code’s failure 
to recognize the cost of raising 
children. The bipartisan tax relief legislation 
provides tax relief for millions 
of families with children, including 
those who pay no income tax at all. In 
addition, the dependent care tax credit 
was enhanced for families with children 
in day care. 

Third, on a bipartisan basis, there 
was concern about helping families 
with the rising cost of education. As a 


S7662 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

response, the bipartisan tax relief legislation 
includes a package of educational 
tax relief measures. 

Fourth, on a bipartisan basis, there 
was concern about declining savings 
rates and the need for more secure retirement 
plan benefits for more workers 
to help baby boomers who are saving 
less. As a response, the bipartisan 
tax relief legislation included significant 
enhancements to individual retirement 
accounts and retirement 
plans. This package was then perhaps 
the greatest improvement in our individual 
IRAs and retirement plans in a 
generation. 

Finally, there was a bipartisan concern 
about the confiscatory impact of 
the death tax, especially for family 
farmers and small businesses. As a response, 
the bipartisan tax relief legislation 
includes death tax relief, including 
repeal. 

Today I have talked about the three 
most important reasons from my perspective 
why we were able to pass the 
largest bipartisan tax relief measure in 
a generation. 

The first reason is to correct the policy 
of overtaxation that stemmed from 
the heavy tax hike of 1993. 

The second is to respond with an economic 
stimulus against the current 
economic slowdown. 

The third is there are sufficient budgetary 
resources to address tax fairness 
problems. 

It is important to realize that the 
major tax legislation just enacted rests 
on a very sound foundation. It should 
not be dismissed, it should not be obfuscated, 
and it should not otherwise 
be distorted by budgetary demagoguery. 
Let us not forget that revenue 
is not an abstract notion. Revenue reflects 
the sum total payments to Washington 
by hard-working men and 
women. It is not abstract when paid 
and should not be treated as an entitlement 
by those of us fortunate enough 
to be sent here to make policy decisions 
to represent the folks back home. 

We have a very good tax bill. Our 
challenge is to make sure that those in 
Congress who want to spend more 
money and do not like giving the people 
back their money—we are intent 
upon keeping this reduction of revenue 
coming into the Federal Treasury, not 
because we are concerned about the 
taxpayers, but because if those taxpayers 
spend that money, it is going to 
do more economic good and turn over 
the economy, create more jobs and 
more wealth than if I spend it as a 
Member of the Senate. 

I yield the floor. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
The Senator from California. 

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for approximately 
20 minutes in morning 
business. 

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 


CONTROLLING THE PROLIFERATION 
OF SMALL ARMS AND 
LIGHT WEAPONS 

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to speak about the proliferation 
of small arms around the world 
and, specifically, the remarks made by 
John Bolton, the Under Secretary of 
State for Arms Control and International 
Security Affairs before the 
United Nations this past July 9 at the 
United Nations Conference on the Illicit 
Trade in Small Arms and Light 
Weapons in All its Aspects. 

I begin by saying what I sincerely believe: 
I think it is right and necessary 
to limit the illicit sale of small arms 
and light weapons on a worldwide 
basis. In order to do that, however, one 
also has to address transparency and 
legal transfers of small arms and light 
weapons because so much of the illicit 
proliferation problem has its roots in 
legal sales. I was therefore very surprised 
that Under Secretary Bolton 
said the United States may well be opposed 
to measures being considered by 
the conference that are aimed at curbing 
the international proliferation of 
small arms and light weapons. 

Before I address Mr. Bolton’s speech, 
and the question it raises about the direction 
of the administration’s policy 
in this area, I would like to briefly 
sketch out the scope and scale of this 
problem: 

The worldwide proliferation of small 
arms—this includes shoulder-mounted 
missiles, assault weapons, grenade 
launchers, and high-powered sniper rifles—
is a staggering problem today. 
Right now there are an estimated 500 
million illicit small arms and light 
weapons in circulation around the 
globe. 

In the past decade alone, an estimated 
4 million people have been killed 
in civil war and bloody fighting, many 
of them with these same small arms. 

As a matter of fact, 9 out of 10 of 
these deaths are attributed to small 
arms and light weapons. According to 
the International Committee of the 
Red Cross, more than 50 percent of the 
4 million people killed—that is 2 million 
people—are believed to be civilians. 
The sheer volume of available 
weaponry has been a major factor in 
the devastation witnessed in recent 
conflicts in Angola, Cambodia, Liberia, 
Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, 
Somalia, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, 
as well as the sort of violence endemic 
to narcotrafficking in Colombia and 
Mexico. These conflicts undermine the 
regional stability, and they endanger 
the spread of democracy and free markets 
around the world. 

The United Nations and the Red 
Cross estimate that more than 10 million 
small arms and light weapons, 
ranging from pistols to AK–47’s to hand 
grenades to shoulder-launched missiles, 
are today in circulation in Afghanistan 
where the terrorist organization 
of Osama bin Laden is based. 

The United Nations estimates that 
over 650,000 weapons disappeared from 

government depots in Albania in the 3 
years leading up to the outbreak of violence 
in the Balkans, including 20,000 
tons of explosives. 

NATO peacekeepers and U.S. soldiers 
in the region are under threat and in 
danger from these weapons. In fact, the 
increased access by terrorists, guerrilla 
groups, criminals, and others to small 
arms and light weapons poses a real 
threat to all U.S. participants in peacekeeping 
operations and U.S. forces 
based overseas. 

Clearly, this is a substantial problem, 
and it has profound implications 
for U.S. security interests. It is because 
of the scope and scale of the 
problem that the United Nations conference 
on the illicit trade in small 
arms and light weapons, I believe, is so 
important. 

Unfortunately, as the Washington 
Post editorial on July 10 put it, Mr. 
Bolton’s opening address ‘‘appeared designed 
to cater to the most extreme domestic 
opponents of gun control’’. Although 
I do not disagree with all that 
Mr. Bolton said, I want to ask that we 
examine more closely the implications 
of some of his statements, and how 
they conflict with both settled Supreme 
Court precedent and the goals of 
stemming the tide of illicit arms into 
the hands of terrorists, drug cartels, 
and violent rebellions. 

First, Mr. Bolton stated that ‘‘The 
United States will not join consensus 
on a final document that contains 
measures contrary to our constitutional 
right to keep and bear arms.’’ 

As the Post’s editorial points out, 
‘‘No such measures appear in the draft 
documents before the conference.’’ 
Why, exactly, did he do that? 

I believe not only is Mr. Bolton 
wrong in his assertion about the connection 
between the Second Amendment 
and the work of conference, but 
in any case Mr. Bolton’s position on 
the Second Amendment is in direct 
contradiction to decades of Supreme 
Court precedent. 

Not one single gun control law has 
ever been overturned by the Court on 
Second Amendment grounds. 

Contrary to the constant claims of 
the NRA, the meaning of the Second 
Amendment has been well-settled for 
more than 60 years—ever since the 1939 

U.S. Supreme Court ruling in United 
States v. Miller. In that case, the defendant 
was charged with transporting 
an unregistered sawed-off shotgun 
across state lines. 
In rejecting a motion to dismiss the 
case on Second Amendment grounds, 
the Court held that the ‘‘obvious purpose’’ 
of the Second Amendment was 
‘‘to assure the continuation and render 
possible the effectiveness’’ of the 
‘‘state Militia.’’ Because a sawed-off 
shotgun was not a weapon that would 
be used by a ‘‘state Militia’’, like the 
National Guard, the Second Amendment 
was in no way applicable to that 
case, said the Court. 

If a sawed-off shotgun is not protected 
by the Second Amendment, why 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7663 

does the Administration seem to be 
taking the position that the Second 
Amendment protects the international 
trafficking of shoulder-launched missiles? 


If an American citizen cannot freely 
transport a sawed-off shotgun across 
state lines, why can’t we work to stop 
the international transportation of 
grenade launchers and high powered, 
military sniper rifles? 

This second amendment argument 
simply makes no sense, and has no 
place in this debate. 

Second, Mr. Bolton’s opening statement 
attacked language that calls on 
governments to ‘‘seriously consider’’ 
curtailing ‘‘unrestricted sales and ownership’’ 
of arms specifically designed 
for military purposes. 

So Mr. Bolton essentially objected to 
even considering merely curtailing the 
‘‘unrestricted sales and ownership’’ of 
military weapons. 

In point of fact the United States already 
curtails the sale and ownership 
of many of these guns. 

The National Firearms Act, for instance, 
places severe restrictions on 
the manufacture and possession of machine 
guns, sawed-off shotguns, grenades, 
bombs, rockets, missiles, and 
mines. 

We also passed the 1994 assault weapons 
ban, which stopped the production 
of semi-automatic, military-style assault 
weapons. 

These firearms have no sporting purpose, 
and our laws recognize that fact. 
Yet these guns contribute enormously 
to terrorist threats, drug cartel violence, 
and civil strife throughout the 
world. 

Congress has already recognized that 
curtailing the use of military-style 
weapons is reasonable, appropriate, and 
even life-saving. To now object to a 
clause that would call upon other governments 
around the world to do the 
same is nonsensical at best, and undermines 
U.S. security interests—and the 
lives of U.S. military personnel—at 
worst. 

Next, Mr. Bolton stated that the 
United States would ‘‘not support 
measures that would constrain legal 
trade and legal manufacturing of small 
arms and light weapons.’’ That may be 
legitimate read on its face. People can 
understand that. 

Although it is my belief that the 
United States is not the biggest contributor 
to the problem of the global 
proliferation of small arms and light 
weapons—the United Nations has found 
that almost 300 companies in 50 countries 
now manufacture small arms and 
related equipment—in 1999 the U.S. licensed 
for export more than $470 million 
in light military weapons. 

With the average price of $100–$300 
per weapon, this represents a huge volume 
of weapons. 

The problem is that in addressing the 
issue of the international proliferation 
of small arms and light weapons one 
cannot simply address the illicit side of 
the equation without also looking at 

the interactions between the legal 
trade and the illegal trade. 

In fact, there is good evidence of an 
increased incidence of U.S. manufactured 
weapons—legally manufactured 
and legally traded or transferred—flowing 
into the international black market. 


In April, 1998, for example, The New 
York Times reported that the United 
States had to rescind pending licenses 
for sale of U.S. firearms to the United 
Kingdom based on the European Union 
practice allowing retransfer of guns between 
EU members without review or 
oversight. 

In 1999 the State Department stopped 
issuing licenses from the U.S. to dealers 
in Venezuela because of concern 
that many of the guns—legally exported 
and sold—were in fact ending up 
in the hands of narco-traffickers and 
guerrillas in Colombia. 

In 2000 and to date in 2001, the ATF 
has processed more than 19,000 trace requests 
from foreign countries for firearms 
used in crimes: 8,000 of these guns 
were sold legally in the United States. 
So they are sold legally and they get 
into the black market and they become 
part of a crime. 

In 1994, Mexico reported 3,376 illegally 
acquired U.S.-origin firearms. 
Many of these weapons were originally 
sold legally to legitimate buyers but 
then transferred illegally, to many 
Mexican drug cartels. Between 1989 and 
1993, the State Department approved 
108 licenses for the export of $34 million 
in small arms to Mexico, but it performed 
only three follow-up inspections 
to ensure that the weapons were 
delivered to and stayed in the hands of 
the intended users. 

According to the South African Institute 
for Security Studies, an estimated 
30,000 stolen firearms—again, firearms 
originally manufactured and traded, 
sold or transferred in a legal manner— 
enter the illegal marketplace annually 
in South Africa. 

Given this undeniable connection between 
legal sales and illicit trade, the 
approach suggested by Mr. Bolton to 
the Conference—that it should only address 
one part of the equation while ignoring 
the other, appears to me to be 
untenable. 

I would also suggest that certain 
measures which may be seen by some 
as constraints on legal manufacture 
and trade—such as international agreements 
for the marking and tracing 
small arms and light weapons, or seeing 
that there are international regulations 
governing the activities of arms 
brokers—are in fact wise policy. 

Mr. Bolton also stated: 

Neither will we, at this time, commit to 
begin negotiations and reach agreements on 
legally binding instruments, the feasibility 
and necessity of which may be in question 
and in need of review over time. 

Yet, as Mr. Bolton himself points out 
in his statement, the United States has 
some of the best laws and regulations 
on the books regarding the sale and 
transfers of light weapons. 

In my view it is clearly in the U.S. 
interest to see that those standards are 
replicated by the world community. 

Mr. Bolton’s statement is fulsome in 
its praise of U.S. brokering regulations. 
Why do we not want to see others 
rise to the same standards? 

Mr. Bolton’s statement cites U.S. 
regulations governing the transfer of 
military articles of U.S. origin and 

U.S. exports of small arms and light 
weapons. 
Instead of going it alone—with limited 
success even when it comes to 
some of our closest allies, like the 
United Kingdom, as the example I cited 
above indicates—shouldn’t we be working 
to see to it that the rest of the 
international community adopts similar 
standards? I think so. 

In approaching the United Nations 
Conference, the U.S. government 
should negotiate and support making 
the trafficking of small arms traceable, 
strengthen international regulations of 
transfers, bolster rules governing arms 
brokers, and eliminate the secrecy that 
permits thousands of weapons to fuel 
crime and war without anyone’s knowledge 
of their source. 

We should be taking the lead on this 
issue based on our foreign policy and 
national security interests, not taking 
the NRA line based on domestic political 
considerations. 

And U.S. leadership should ensure 
that the Conference is the first step, 
not the last, in the international community’s 
efforts to control the spread 
of small arms and light weapons. 

The problem is you cannot look at 
the illicit trade of small arms and light 
weapons, which is killing millions upon 
millions of people, 50 percent of them 
innocent civilians, without increasing 
the transparency of the legal market 
because so many of these weapons go 
from the legal market into the black 
market—the illicit market. 

I yield the floor.

f 


CONFIRMATION OF NOMINEES 
Mr. KYL. We started this session of 
Congress, I think, on a fairly high note 
of bipartisanship. While there have 
been some recent events that may have 
detracted from that, I think most of us 
would like to proceed with as much bipartisanship 
as possible. Part of this, 


S7664 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

of course, concerns relationships between 
the Congress and the President. 

Since the majority in the Senate and 
the President are of different parties, 
that may be a little more difficult, but 
I have a suggestion today which I hope 
will enable us to move in that direction. 


The President has a number of nominees, 
executive branch nominees, there 
are a few legislative branch nominees 
that require our actions, and then 
there are some judicial nominees. I 
hope in a real spirit of bipartisanship 
we can get those nominees cleared; 
that is to say, the Senate can confirm 
the President’s nominations and the 
personnel that he needs in the executive 
branch to get his work done, and 
that we can confirm the judges the 
courts need. These are people who need 
to be put into place so our country can 
move forward for all of the American 
people. 

Up until last week, unfortunately, 
the Senate had been acting at a relatively 
slow pace. I might also add the 
change from the majority to the minority, 
and vice verse, undoubtedly 
complicated this, but we were not making 
very good progress. 

Last week, I note that 54 nominees 
were confirmed by the Senate. In fact, 
36 were confirmed just last Thursday. 
So we are finally beginning to make 
some progress. I urge my colleagues to 
continue this progress because, by my 
count, there are 93 executive branch 
nominees pending as of today. Only 26 
have had hearings. But as we know, it 
does not take too much for the committee 
work to follow shortly after a 
hearing so the nominees can actually 
come to the Senate for full debate and 
confirmation by the full Senate. 

As of today, according to the administration’s 
figures, approximately 347 
nominees have come to the Senate, and 
only 187 have been confirmed. So we 
still have a fair amount of work to do. 

In terms of judicial nominees, my understanding 
is that there are 29 nominations 
pending, 3 of which have had 
hearings. Of those, 20 are circuit court 
nominees, 9 are district court nominees. 
The bottom line with regard to 
the courts is that as of today, no circuit 
or district court judges have been 
confirmed this year. We are, of course, 
now past the midway point of this 
year. 

We are going to have to get going. 
Again, I do not want to point any fingers 
in the spirit of bipartisanship 
which I am invoking here today. I am 
hoping Republicans and Democrats in 
the Senate and the administration can 
work very closely together. 

What I would like to do, and I will do 
at the end of my remarks, is submit for 
the RECORD the names of the nominees 
who are pending. I was going to read 
the names of the people who are currently 
pending, but I do not need to do 
that. I will submit those for the 
RECORD. But I would note some of these 
have been pending going back to the 
month of April. Clearly the Senate can 

act on those nominees who have been 
before us for a long period of time, and 
we should expedite those who have 
come before us, even fairly recently. It 
should be our goal that by the time we 
conclude our work in July and return 
to our States for the August recess, 
that all of the nominees who have 
come to the Senate, except maybe in 
the last couple of days before that period 
of time, will have been cleared; 
that is to say, they will have had their 
hearings, come out of committee, and 
been acted upon by the full Senate. 
Very few of them are controversial, as 
I go down the list. 

I do note in a couple of cases nominees 
are being held up by Senators—actually 
in four or five cases. A couple of 
those are being held up by Republicans, 
and a few more are being held up by 
Democrats. I am going to urge my Republican 
colleagues to cooperate so the 
concerns they have expressed can be 
dealt with and the nominees can move 
forward. I hope my Democratic colleagues 
will do the same on their side 
of the aisle. I think it is important 
that while a Member of the Senate may 
put a technical hold on a nomination, 
we all appreciate all that means is that 
they have requested to be notified if 
the majority leader is going to call 
that nominee up for a full Senate consideration 
so that Senator will then 
have an opportunity to object. Obviously, 
we do not want to put Members 
in that position, but I do think it is important 
for the full Senate to be able to 
work its will on these nominees. That 
is why I am going to ask both Republicans 
and Democrats, where they have 
a problem with somebody, to try to 
work that out with the administration 
so we can proceed. 

Finally, last week I worked with the 
distinguished majority leader and the 
assistant majority leader in ensuring 
we could both bring the appropriations 
bills that we have to deal with to the 
Senate floor and to get these nominees 
done at the same time. There is nothing 
to prevent us from bringing an appropriations 
bill to the floor and then 
toward the end of the day, for those 
nominees that do not require debate 
and rollcall vote, having them considered 
in the wrap-up. 

I will continue to do that because it 
is my expectation that we will not 
have to use the rules of parliamentary 
procedure that we all have available to 
us to hold up business of the Senate in 
order to get these nominees done since 
they are the top priority; that we can 
actually do both at the same time. 

That is my request of the majority 
leader and of the assistant majority 
leader—to continue to work in that 
spirit moving forward both with the 
appropriations bill and with the nominees. 
I will have more to say about this 
later. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
names of the nominees who are currently 
pending be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the

REGULATION OF ENERGY 
MARKETS 

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to address an issue of extraordinary 
importance to the State of 
Washington, the Pacific Northwest, 
and the entire west coast. That is the 
role of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission in regulating our Nation’s 
energy markets and righting the 
wrongs that have been visited upon 
ratepayers in the West by runaway energy 
prices over the last year. 

We are now 22 days into an expedited 
review process by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, designed to 
determine refunds for the unjust and 
unreasonable rates paid by Western 
consumers. 

At the urging of my colleagues from 
the Northwest, Senators MURRAY, 
WYDEN, SMITH, and myself, FERC finally 
recognized the realities of the energy 
markets in the West when they allowed 
Pacific Northwest utilities to 
participate in these proceedings and 
the expedited review process. But my 
main concern is that in the haste of 
putting the California debacle behind 
it, FERC will again overlook the 
Northwest and consumers who have 
been impacted by as much as 50-percent 
rate increases. 

I am afraid my suspicions were borne 
out last week when the administrative 
law judge charged with overseeing this 
refund matter issued his recommendations 
to FERC, again paying little attention 
to the Northwest problem. It is 
now up to FERC to determine what to 
do with the judge’s recommendation. 

I believe the Commission should 
not—and cannot—in the interest of 
fairness ignore the Northwest in its refund 
calculation. While many of my 
colleagues are well aware of the toll 
this crisis has taken on California, 
we—and FERC—cannot disregard the 
impact that it has had on Northwest 
citizens, businesses, and communities 
of Washington State. 

Equitable treatment in this refund 
proceeding requires that the Commission 
recognize a certain fundamental 
truth: That Northwest consumers have 
been harmed, and they have been 
harmed by unjust and unreasonable 
prices that have prevailed in all energy 
markets throughout the West—inside 


S7666 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

and outside California, and in spot, forward, 
and long-term power markets. 

There are differences between how 
California and Northwest utilities 
manage their obligations to serve consumers. 
Thus, FERC should not come 
up with a one-size-fits-all solution for a 
refund methodology. The basic litmus 
test should be this: Did power rates 
meet the commonsense test of reasonableness? 
If the answer is no, then the 
Commission must order refunds. This 
determination should not depend on 
whether the utilities bought energy on 
the spot market or made their purchases 
under long-term contracts. 

The Northwest has been hurt by California’s 
dysfunctional marketplace, 
and yet we now also risk being hurt because 
we in the Pacific Northwest do 
not operate the same way as the California 
ISO, when it comes to the issue 
of refunds. We run the risk of being penalized 
twice. 

Western consumers have been impacted 
by the havoc unleashed by California’s 
unstable energy markets and 
the apparent gamesmanship of a few 
who have taken advantage of this broken 
power market. 

This topic is of particular concern to 
the Northwest because, as the crisis 
has evolved, FERC has been slow to respond 
to the situation in California, 
and slower to respond in the Northwest. 
In the refund proceeding, focusing 
solely on California’s spot markets 
would significantly harm the utilities 
of my State and ignore the residual 
damage that California has caused in 
all of the energy markets throughout 
the West. 

What are some of those impacts? 
Make no mistake. The pain inflicted by 
this crisis has been real on the people 
of Washington State. Over the last 
year skyrocketing energy prices have 
caused retail electricity rates to rise in 
all corners of my State: 20 percent in 
Clark County, 30 percent in Cowlitz, 
Skamania, and Okanogan counties, 35 
percent in Snohomish County, and 50 
percent in the cities of Tacoma and Seattle. 
Even as these utilities have 
passed on rate increases to consumers, 
some have been forced to issue hundreds 
of millions of dollars’ worth of 
bonds to cover the cost. Seattle, for example, 
normally spends $100 million 
per year on purchasing power. This 
year the city spent over $450 million to 
keep the lights on—and that is just in 
the first 6 months of the year. 

While the utility in its first 98 years 
of history issued a total of only about 
$1 billion in bonds, it is having to issue 
$700 million in debt this year alone to 
pay for its purchased power bills. A 
number of Northwest utilities have 
even had their bond ratings downgraded 
as a result of this crisis. 

Indeed, the economic impacts on 
Washington have already begun to take 
root. Energy-intensive industries such 
as aluminum smelting and pulp and 
paper industries have been driven to 
the brink of collapse, and layoffs already 
number in the tens of thousands. 

There are innumerable other businesses 
that are on the brink as well. 

For example, Georgia-Pacific has 
shut down its pulp and paper mill in 
Bellingham, WA, laying off 420 workers. 
Another pulp and paper mill in 
Steilacom, WA, has had to idle its 
workforce due to escalating power 
prices. 

Washington’s aluminum industry, 
which provides my State with between 
7,000 to 8,000 family-wage jobs, has curtailed 
a large part of its production 
anywhere from 6 months to 2 years. 
And it is unclear whether those companies 
will ever resume production at 
their current levels given this agreement 
to shut down. 

These companies, which produce a 
large portion of the Nation’s aluminum, 
have given up more than 75 
percent of their power in order to minimize 
the rate increase for the entire region. 


Due to drought conditions and the 
cost of purchasing power for irrigation, 
many farmers in the State of Washington 
have also been hurt. They have 
chosen to forego the planting this summer. 


Because agriculture is already one of 
the most stressed industries in Washington, 
the impacts of the current energy 
situation are particularly devastating. 
Many of our irrigators have 
been paid not to farm based on energy 
savings compared to the their previous 
year’s usage. When irrigators can’t 
farm, that has ramifications for entire 
communities and related businesses 
such as cold storage, food processing, 
and transportation. So the agricultural 
impact is being felt broadly in our 
State. 

The effect on small businesses have 
been equally harrowing. At a Small 
Business Committee field hearing that 
was held in Seattle by the chairman, 
Senator KERRY, I heard from the president 
of a steel foundry based in Tacoma, 
which has been in operation 
since 1899—a company that employs 
over 350 people. In the face of this crisis, 
this plant, with a very aggressive 
approach, reduced its power consumption 
by over 20 percent. At the same 
time, the foundry has increased its efficiency 
and will actually produce more 
steel this year. But despite this extraordinary 
effort to reducing energy 
consumption, the company’s power 
bills are 60 percent over what it was 
the year before, virtually eliminating 
any profits and already forcing a handful 
of layoffs. In the words of the company’s 
president, any further rate increase 
will mean that the foundry will 
have to close its doors. 

This crisis has a very human face. 
The LIHEAP caseload in the State of 
Washington is expected to grow 50 percent 
this year. I have heard from many 
senior citizens who can’t afford to light 
their homes at night and will be making 
hard choices later this fall and winter 
about heating their homes and buying 
food. I have visited children who 
are worried that their parents, in some 

of those industries I mentioned, will 
lose their jobs. And those children are 
concerned they will then lose their 
homes when their mothers and fathers 
do not have the work to pay their bills. 

Our schools have also had to cut corners. 
The Central Valley School District 
near Spokane, for example, has 
had to divert over $200,000, that would 
otherwise be used to purchase textbooks, 
to pay its energy bills. 

What is more startling is the gravity 
of these impacts, and the number of 
Washington residents suffering from 
this crisis, is going to continue to 
grow. I say that because the Bonneville 
Power Administration, which provides 
Washington with 70 percent of its 
power, will be forced to raise its rates 
another 46 percent this October. 

It is clear that FERC has an obligation 
to help these people I have just 
mentioned, and to help the State of 
Washington overcome the economic 
impacts caused by the California market 
and by a serious drought. FERC 
must not only stabilize our market and 
ensure fair rates in the future, but 
must also address past wrongs and the 
harm that has impacted consumers. 

FERC took its first serious step in its 
June 19 price mitigation order. Given 
the economic casualties in my State, I 
believe this action was long overdue. 
But it was a positive first step. 

The effectiveness of FERC’s price 
mitigation plan will remain of vital 
concern to all of us from the West. We 
need to remain mindful of what the effects 
of this California-focused mechanism 
on supply in the Northwest, as 
our region’s peak winter heating season 
approaches. 

But let me address specifically the 
issue of refunds and where we are today 
in the process. Of particular concern to 
me is the fact that, as part of the June 
19 order, FERC established a 15-day 
settlement conference for participants 
in California energy markets, and others 
in the West, to reach agreement on 
potential refunds for overcharges and 
settlement of California’s unpaid accounts. 


As has been the case throughout this 
crisis, the order was initially silent on 
the issue of relief for the Pacific Northwest. 
It was only after the intervention 
of a bipartisan group of Northwest Senators 
that FERC amended its order 
clarifying that Northwest parties 
would also participate in those discussions. 


But the 15-day settlement window 
has now closed and no agreement has 
been reached—for consumers in either 
Washington State or California. As I 
have mentioned, the administrative 
law judge made his recommendation 
last week on how to proceed. He was 
mostly silent on the issue of relief for 
the Pacific Northwest. It should also be 
noted that, to the extent the recommendations 
did comment on our 
concerns, it was not factually correct. 

While the recommendations said Pacific 
Northwest parties ‘‘did not have 
data on what they were owed, nor an 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7667 

amount of refunds due them,’’ it is a 
matter of public record that a group of 
Northwest utilities—net purchasers in 
the West’s dysfunctional power markets—
submitted a claim for $680 million, 
as well as documentation and a 
proposed methodology for calculating 
those refunds. 

That notwithstanding, this is a silence 
the Commission itself cannot, in 
the interest of fairness, sustain. FERC 
must seek an equitable solution for the 
Northwest. In order to do that I believe 
it is critical that FERC recognize some 
fundamental differences between the 
Northwest and California energy markets—
and that fundamental fairness 
requires that refunds go to customers 
in California and the Northwest. 

First, FERC needs to recognize that 
most Northwest participants in the 
California markets are load-serving 
utilities. These load-serving utilities 
are responsible for a very small percentage 
of the power sold into the California 
market—certainly no more than 
4 percent—and they are clearly not the 
parties that broke the market. Further, 
many in the Northwest, especially 
the Bonneville Power Administration, 
have been partners in helping 
solve the California problem by keeping 
the lights on during emergencies, 
at costs to the Northwest that cannot 
necessarily easily be quantified—particularly 
when one takes into account 
the Northwest’s endangered species and 
salmon issues, and the delicate balance 
we work hard to achieve. Every time 
we generate power, it is quite a delicate 
balance. 

Unlike power marketers or merchant 
generators, Northwest utilities operate 
under a statutory obligation to meet 
all their customers’ electricity needs. 
Further, our region’s power supply is 
essentially based on hydropower. A full 
78 percent of Washington state’s generation 
comes from hydropower. As has 
been made painfully clear by this 
year’s drought—which has amounted to 
the second worst year of drought on 
record in the history of our State—the 
vagaries of hydroelectric production 
require that our utilities make other 
wholesale power purchases to meed 
load. In keeping with reasonable utility 
planning practices, these companies 
buy a portfolio of products of 
varying duration. 

This points to a second, fundamental 
difference between the Northwest and 
California markets: Whereas California 
utilities were forced, under the State’s 
restructuring law, to make all of their 
purchases in a centralized hour-ahead 
or day-ahead market, we have no such 
centralized market in the Northwest. 
While we do have very short-term bilateral 
markets, our utilities have traditionally 
only used these to balance 
the difference between forecasted and 
actual loads, streamflows, weather conditions, 
and other similar factors. 

Unlike the California ISO market, 
the Northwest utilities rely heavily on 
‘‘forward’’ or long-term contracts that 
last for periods varying from a month 

ahead to a quarter or two or even 
longer. 

But these contracts have been closely 
affected by the skyrocketing spot market 
prices in California. It is thus absolutely 
crucial, for the purposes of its 
refund proceeding, that the FERC recognize 
that power prices throughout 
the West—and not just in spot markets, 
but in these forward contracts as 
well—are unjust and unreasonable. 
Washington State’s prices have moved 
in lockstep with the spot market 
prices. 

In its June 19 order, the Commission 
itself commented on this, stating that 
there is a ‘‘critical interdependence 
among prices in the ISO’s organized 
spot markets, the prices in the bilateral 
spot markets in California and the 
rest of the West, and the prices in forward 
markets.’’ 

So the Commission itself has recognized 
the relationship between these 
prices. Indeed, when one compares forward 
contract prices in the Northwest 
with spot market rates both within the 
region and in California over the last 
year, they show a correlation of more 
than 80 percent on a monthly average 
basis; that is, forward prices in the 
Northwest have moved in tandem with 
California’s prices, which the Commission 
has deemed unjust and unreasonable. 
It is these forward prices that 
have largely driven the rate increases 
in the Northwest. 

It is clear, then, that any FERC refund 
order that seeks to treat all Western 
participants fairly, as the Power 
Act says it must, must recognize the 
relationship between spot markets and 
forward markets. 

Simply put, any refund policy must 
not disadvantage the utilities in the 
Northwest because of the contractual 
mechanism they have used to acquire 
power. 

Let me just touch on the case of BPA 
because I mentioned it earlier. 
Throughout this crisis, BPA has responded 
to the California ISO’s urgent 
calls for power supply when the State 
was teetering on the edge of rolling 
blackouts. In fact, on three separate 
occasions, the Department of Energy 
issued emergency orders directing Bonneville 
to sell power into the State of 
California. It should also be noted, 
however, that California entities have 
yet to repay BPA for about $100 million 
of these transactions. 

As one of these entities has entered 
into bankruptcy, it remains questionable 
how the Northwest will ever receive 
this $100 million repayment. 
Meanwhile, BPA has at times drawn 
down its reservoirs, arguably compromising 
the reliability of Northwest 
power system to aid California. So 
while BPA has sold into the California 
spot market, it has actually been a net 
purchaser during the crisis, when one 
takes into account its forward contracts. 
And when faced with the volatile 
energy prices throughout the West, 
Bonneville earlier this year made the 
difficult decision to pay consumers to 

curtail their loads rather than to venture 
into the market. 

I mentioned various of those efforts 
earlier in my remarks about the aluminum 
industry. Bonneville and the 
Northwest customers it serves have 
been victims of the power crisis 
touched off by this experimentation in 
partial deregulation, which has created 
this dysfunctional market. 

In conclusion, it is important that 
the Commission act fairly and that my 
State’s utilities not be penalized for 
sales into California when they have 
been forced to purchase power at a 
similar unjust and unreasonable rate. 

It is very important that the Commission 
work toward a solution that 
gives the Northwest refunds, just as it 
is promising to do in California. FERC 
must work towards a comprehensive 
settlement that addresses the claims of 
both California and the Northwest. In 
order to reach an equitable solution, it 
must acknowledge the fundamental 
differences in the two markets. I believe 
a fair outcome requires FERC to 
take a few simple steps. 

First, FERC must recognize an inescapable 
commonsense conclusion: that 
all Western power markets have been 
dysfunctional for quite some time. The 
Commission’s duty under the Federal 
Power Act is to ensure just and reasonable 
rates in all markets at all times. 
I urge the Commission to act in accordance 
with section 309 of the Power Act 
in doing this. 

Second, power prices have been unjust 
regardless of the type of market 
which the Northwest operates in. The 
fact is, we in the Northwest have a different 
market than California, and 
FERC simply cannot use the same formula 
when calculating refunds for our 
consumers. It must take into account 
both forward and long-term contracts. 
Those utilities that can, using this 
methodology, demonstrate a legitimate 
complaint should receive refunds. 

Third, FERC must not leave the 
Northwest behind. Northwest utilities 
must be allowed to plead their case 
during the upcoming evidentiary hearing. 


Finally, repayments of amounts due 
to the Northwest for sales into California 
must be an integral part of any 
refund calculation. 

I call on the FERC Commissioners to 
incorporate these principles into a refund 
policy for the Northwest. It is indisputable 
that the Northwest has been 
harmed. Now it is up to FERC to take 
the action to mitigate those damages 
and to repay the consumers in Washington 
State.

THE GREAT COMPROMISE 
Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 214 years 
ago today, on July 16, 1787, the members 
of the Constitutional Convention 
agreed to what is known as the Great 
Compromise. Edmund Randolph, on 
May 29, 1787, had introduced the ‘‘Virginia 
Plan’’, drafted by James Madison, 


S7668 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

which provided for a Senate and a 
House of Representatives and would replace 
the unicameral legislature under 
the Articles of Confederation. Randolph 
had described the plan as designed 
to promote ‘‘peace, harmony, 
happiness, and liberty.’’ Under the Virginia 
plan, both Houses of Congress 
would be apportioned by population, an 
arrangement that would favor larger 
states like Virginia, the State of Pennsylvania, 
the State of Massachusetts. 

On June 15, William Patterson had 
countered with the ‘‘New Jersey’’ plan, 
which was really a series of amendments 
designed to strengthen rather 
than replace the Articles of Confederation. 
Its supporters, representing 
the smaller States, worried that the 
Virginia Plan went too far in creating 
a central government and that it would 
diminish the power of the individual 
States. However, the Delegates rejected 
the New Jersey Plan and committed 
themselves to the creation of a 
new form of government. 

The smaller States had lost the first 
battle, but they had enough votes to 
keep the Convention from succeeding, 
unless it was agreed that the new government 
would firmly protect their 
rights, the rights of the smaller States. 
They demanded the same equality of 
the States that had existed under the 
Articles of Confederation. On July 1, 
the Convention split 5 to 5 on the issue. 
The Georgia Delegates were split and 
did not vote. This tie represented a 
deadlock between the conflicting demands 
of the larger and smaller States. 

When the Convention recessed to celebrate 
the Fourth of July, the Delegates 
appointed a special Committee to 
solve the dispute. Elbridge Gerry of 
Massachusetts chaired the Committee 
which devised a compromise that apportioned 
the House by population and 
gave the states equality in the Senate. 
Inasmuch as the idea for the special 
Committee had been proposed by Roger 
Sherman, a Connecticut Delegate, the 
‘‘Great Compromise’’ is also known as 
the ‘‘Connecticut Compromise.’’ In promoting 
the plan, William Samuel 
Johnson of Connecticut explained that 
under this arrangement the two Houses 
of Congress would be ‘‘halves of a 
unique whole.’’ 

The Great Compromise is one of the 
more momentous events in our country’s 
history. Most people are probably 
unaware of it or have forgotten their 
high school days during which they 
should have learned about it. But for 
the Great Compromise, the course of 
our country’s history might have been 
forever altered. 

Fortunately for us, the men who attended 
the Philadelphia Convention 
were some of the ablest and brightest 
leaders of the time, in fact, of any 
time. What a gathering that was. Never 
before, since the Last Supper at which 
our Lord sat and broke bread with 
those about the table, was there a 
gathering like ths one in Philadelphia, 
214 years ago today. 

What a gathering that was! Never before 
had there been such an abundance 

of wisdom and learning, grace and dignity—
not since the Roman Senate had 
gathered and been observed by Cineas, 
the Ambassador of Pyrrhus, King of 
Epirus, who visited the Roman Senate 
at the behest of Pyrrhus. 

Cineas, the philosopher, was charged 
by Pyrrhus to present a peace proposal 
to the Roman Senate. Cineas had 
brought with him bribes for Roman 
Senators. He had brought with him 
rich robes for the wives of Senators. 
But he had found no takers—none. 
Cineas was impressed. The sight of this 
great city, the city of Rome of the 
seven hills, its austere manner, and its 
patriotic zeal, struck Cineas with admiration. 
When he had heard the deliberations 
of the Roman Senate and he 
had observed its men, he reported to 
Pyrrhus that here was no mere gathering 
of venal politicians, here was no 
haphazard council of mediocre minds, 
but, in dignity and statesmanship, 
veritably ‘‘an assemblage of kings.’’ 

How fortunate to have been one of 
the members of the Constitutional 
Convention. Never before or after, 
since conclaves on Mount Olympus, attended 
by the ‘‘gods of Greece’’ in 
Rome, has there been a gathering like 
it. From Virginia alone, there were 
George Washington, James Madison, 
George Mason, Edmund Randolph. 
From Massachusetts, there were El-
bridge Gerry and Rufus King. From 
Pennsylvania, there were James Wilson, 
Benjamin Franklin, and the man 
with the peg leg, Gouverneur Morris. 
And from New York, there was the 
great Alexander Hamilton—small in 
stature but large in wisdom. Here was 
a constitutional ‘‘dream team’’ for the 
ages. Fifty-five men, in all, presented 
their credentials at the Convention, 
representing every State, save one— 
Rhode Island. And with passion and 
gusto, they had set about devising a 
plan that would create a new nation. 

In our own time, in these sometimes 
disgustingly partisan days, many of us 
are prone to overlook the tremendous 
physical and mental effort expended in 
drafting the Constitution. In reading 
this short document—here it is, the 
Constitution of the United States. I 
hold it in my hand. In reading this 
short document with its precise and 
careful phrases, it is easy to forget the 
toil, the sweat, the prayers, the concerns, 
the frustrations, the shouting, 
and the argumentation and the thinking 
and the pleading and the speeches 
that went into its creation during that 
hot Philadelphia summer. 

Progress was so slow that upon one 
occasion, we will remember that Benjamin 
Franklin, the oldest man in the 
gathering, stood to his feet and addressed 
the chair in which sat Gen. 
George Washington. He said: 

Sir, I have lived a long time, and the 
longer I live the more convincing proof I see 
that God still governs in the affairs of men. 
And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground 
without our Father’s notice, is it possible 
that we can build an empire without our Father’s 
aid? 

The greatest sticking point, and the 
most threatening that was encountered 

in framing the Constitution, according 
to Madison, was the question of whether 
States should be represented in Congress 
equally or on the basis of population. 
The question was far from academic. 
The small States feared that 
they would be swallowed up in a more 
centralized union; The Constitution 
must be acceptable to the small States, 
as well as to the large States. The 
large States of Virginia, Massachusetts, 
and Pennsylvania were looked 
upon by the smaller States with fear 
and distress. The small States feared 
that a Congress based on population 
would be dominated by the large 
States. Virginia would have 16 times as 
many votes as would Delaware. And 
this fact led New Jersey’s Delegates to 
declare that they would not be safe to 
allow Virginia to have such power. 
They rejected the Virginia Plan, which 
had been presented by Gov. Edmund 
Randolph, and they proposed a Congress 
with a single legislative chamber 
in which the States had an equal vote, 
as had been the case with the Congress 
under the Articles of Confederation. 

The Continental Congress had been a 
single chamber. It was followed by the 
Congress under the Articles of Confederation 
in 1781, again a unilateral legislative 
branch. It was the legislative, it 
was the executive, and to a degree it 
was the judicial—all in one. There was 
no chief executive, no president, no 
king, in the form of an individual. Congress 
was the executive under the Confederation. 


There had been days and weeks of 
prolonged and acrimonious debate, but 
the issue had not been resolved. There 
were suggestions that the State boundaries 
should be redrawn so that the 
States would all be of roughly the same 
size. Connecticut advanced a proposal, 
initially made by Roger Sherman, calling 
for equal representation of States 
in the Senate. This had failed to win 
support, with James Madison, surprisingly, 
labeling it as unjust. 

Can you hear the rafters ring? The 
doors were closed. Sentries were at the 
door. Nobody outside knew what was 
going on. Rufus King of Massachusetts 
had angrily announced that he would 
not listen to any talk of equal representation 
in the Senate. James Wilson 
of Pennsylvania maintained that 
the small States had nothing to fear 
from the larger States. Whereupon, 
Gunning Bedford of Delaware retorted, 
‘‘I do not, gentlemen, trust you.’’ And 
he warned his colleagues that the small 
States might form a confederation 
among themselves, or even find ‘‘some 
foreign ally of more honor and good 
faith who will take them by the hand 
and do them justice.’’ 

Can’t you sense the tense feeling of 
the moment? Of course, Bedford was 
roundly rebuked for his words, but the 
threat of foreign alliances hovered 
above the Convention in the stale and 
sticky summer air. There was no air-
conditioning, much like it was in this 
Chamber until 1929. That was the year 
of the great stock market crash—1929. 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7669 

That same year, though, air-conditioning 
came to the Senate Chamber. 
Ah, how great it is—air-conditioning. 
Efforts to resolve this question, this 
nettlesome question ‘‘nearly terminated 
in a dissolution of the Convention’’—
it came just that close. Washington, 
who kept his thoughts mostly 
to himself, confided to Alexander Hamilton 
in July that he ‘‘almost despaired’’ 
of success. Roger Sherman of 
Connecticut lamented that ‘‘it seems 
we have got to a point that we cannot 
move one way or another.’’ 

But the Delegates finally did settle 
the question on Monday, July 16, 1787— 
there it was—Monday, just as today— 
on Monday, July 16, some 2 months 
after the Convention began. The matter 
was finally resolved. 

It may have been a fear of failure 
that led the delegates to settle the 
matter, because they knew that the 
country’s future was in their hands. 
Exhaustion may have played a part, for 
the members had already spent many 
long days and nights in heated debate 
in this vert heated, small Chamber. It 
may have been because of the heat that 
had tormented them for so long. Or 
perhaps the open exchange of opinions 
in that wrenching but vital process of 
debating and questioning and argumentation. 
Franklin had described the 
Convention as ‘‘groping . . . in the 
dark to find political truth’’; perhaps 
they had at last stumbled upon it. In 
any event, on that great day, 214 years 
ago, the Delegates agreed that Congress 
would be composed of a Senate 
with equal representation for each 
state and a House based on proportional 
representation. This was the 
Great Compromise. That is what it was 
called then, and that is what it has 
been called ever since—the Great Compromise. 


Thank God for the Great Compromise. 
The Senator from New Mexico, 
who is now presiding over this Senate, 
would not be here were it not for 
the Great Compromise. The people who 
sit at the bar, the officers of the Senate, 
the pages of the Senate, the galleries 
of the Senate, the Democratic 
whip, Senator REID of Nevada, would 
not be here were it not for the Great 
Compromise. I would not be here. None 
of us would be here. Think of that. 

The outcome of the Convention had 
for so many days held by a single 
thread. At the very first session of the 
Convention, when the Delegates presented 
their credentials, it had been 
noted that the members from Delaware 
were prohibited from changing the Article 
in the Confederation which declared 
that ‘‘in determining questions 
in the United States in Congress assembled, 
each state shall have one 
vote.’’ Delegates from the small states 
had declared that ‘‘no modification 
whatever could reconcile the smaller 
States to the least diminution of their 
equal sovereignty.’’ They would have 
left Philadelphia without accomplishing 
their goal. 

After weeks of anxious debate, it had 
been voted that the ‘‘rule of suffrage in 

the first branch ought not to be according 
to that established in the Articles 
of Confederation’’. In other words, the 
Delegates from the large states succeeded 
in defeating equal representation 
in the lower branch—Ellsworth 
moved that ‘‘the rule of suffrage in the 
second branch be the same with that 
established by the Articles of Confederation.’’ 
In supporting this motion he 
declared that he was ‘‘not sorry on the 
whole that the vote just passed, had determined 
against this rule in the first 
branch. He hoped it would become a 
ground of compromise with regard to 
the second branch.’’ 

Ellsworth later said: ‘‘We were partly 
national; partly federal. The proportional 
representation in the first 
branch was conformable to the national 
principle and would secure the 
large states against the small. An 
equality of votes was conformable to 
the federal principle and was necessary 
to secure the small States against the 
large.’’ 

This conciliatory proposal formed 
the basis of the most important compromise 
in the history of this Republic—
the Great Compromise, probably 
the greatest single compromise ever 
reached in the history of the human 
race. The Great Compromise. 

Its acceptance was not easily attained. 
Wilson feared minority rule 
when one-third of the population in 
seven States might dominate two-
thirds in six States. Ellsworth insisted 
that this fear of minority rule was 
groundless—groundless. Madison had 
considered suggesting that representation 
in one branch should be computed 
according to the number of free inhabitants 
only and in the other branch according 
to the whole number, counting 
the slaves as if free. 

When Ellsworth’s motion for allowing 
each State an equal vote in the second 
branch was brought to a vote, it 
was lost by a tie. This deadlock gave 
rise to tense debate. Can you imagine 
the tension in that Chamber? We have 
seen tensions in this Chamber during 
the great debate, the great civil rights 
debate, the Civil Rights Act of 1964— 
tension—the North and the South pitted 
against each other, and the great 
tensions during the Panama Canal debates. 


The result was the adoption of a proposal 
that a special committee consisting 
of one member from each State 
should be appointed to devise and report 
some compromise. Three days 
later, on July 5, the committee presented 
two recommendations ‘‘on the 
condition that both shall be generally 
adopted.’’ 

The first recommendation, in effect, 
provided that in the first branch of the 
legislature each state would have one 
Representative for every 40,000 inhabitants, 
counting three-fifths of the 
slaves; and that all bills for raising or 
appropriating money should originate 
in the lower branch and not be altered 
or amended by the second branch; and 
that no money should be drawn from 

the public treasury but in pursuance of 
appropriations to be originated in the 
first branch. According to the second 
recommendation, each State was to 
have an equal vote in the second 
branch. 

This compromise proposal was under 
debate for 10 days. And you know 
what? Madison hoped for its rejection. 
But on the morning of July 16, today, 
214 years ago, God be thanked for the 
rising of the sun that morning 214 
years ago—the whole compromise was 
adopted. 

But the vote was close. Five states— 
Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, 
Maryland, and North Carolina—had 
voted ‘‘aye’’; four states—Pennsylvania, 
Virginia, South Carolina, and 
Georgia—had voted ‘‘no’’; while Massachusetts’ 
four votes were equally divided. 
Thus, this momentous question 
had been decided by one vote! 

Without the Great Compromise, it is 
hard to see how the Federal Convention 
could have proceeded; since the 
beginning it had been cause for battle. 
The effort to resolve it, Luther Martin 
had written later, ‘‘nearly terminated 
in a dissolution of the Convention.’’ 
Swords stacked upon swords and 
shields upon shields. 

The small states were jubilant over 
the compromise; the large states, 
alarmed, tried to reorganize, recover 
their position. The rules of the Convention 
would have let them reconsider 
the subject, but it was hopeless. The 
large states knew that they were beaten, 
and, after July 17, they let the 
question die. From then on, matters 
moved more easily, the little states 
were more ready to meet the big states 
and were willing to yield on many 
questions. They felt safe, and they 
were no longer threatened by Virginia, 
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, to them, 
the towering bullies. Caleb Strong told 
his colleagues in Boston that the federal 
Convention had been ‘‘nigh breaking 
up,’’ but for the compromise. Luther 
Martin declared in Annapolis that 
even Dr. Franklin had only conceded to 
equality in the Senate when he found 
that no other terms would be accepted. 

Catherine Drinker Bowen, in her 
book, ‘‘Miracle at Philadelphia,’’ states 
that Madison ‘‘in his old age sat down 
a clear testimony in letters to his 
friends. The threatened contest in the 
federal Convention, he said, had not 
turned, as most men supposed, on the 
degree of power to be granted to the 
central government but rather on ‘the 
rule by which the states should be represented 
and vote in the government’. 
They questioned ‘the most threatening 
that was encountered in framing the 
Constitution.’’’ Those were Madison’s 
words. 

Mr. President, we should thank Providence 
for this miraculous document. 
Let me hold it again in my hand. There 
it is, the Constitution of the United 
States. We should thank Providence 
because Providence had to smile upon 
this gathering of illustrious men. 
Never had such a gathering of men, a 


S7670 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

gathering of superior minds, taken 
place anywhere in the world. We should 
thank Providence for this document. 

One thing is clear: Without the Great 
Compromise, the Senate of the United 
States would not exist, for this body 
was conceived on that day 214 years 
ago. In Philadelphia, when the Framers 
agreed to an upper house of Congress in 
which each State—small, like West 
Virginia, which did not exist then but 
very surely exists now—would have an 
equal number of votes, each State 
would have equal representation. 

The Senate is the forum that was 
born on that day. But for the Great 
Compromise, this beloved institution— 
the Senate—to which so many of us 
have dedicated our lives and our hopes 
and our reputations, our strength and 
our talents and our visions—might 
never have seen the light of day, let 
alone played an often pivotal and dramatic 
role in our national history over 
the course of more than two centuries. 

The Chamber in which we sit today 
owes its existence to that remarkable 
instance of compromise and conciliation. 


But for that Compromise, no Senator 
could wear the great title of Senator. 

It recalls to my mind Majorian, who, 
in the year 457 A.D. when he was made 
emperor of the west, said he was ‘‘A 
prince who still glories in the name of 
‘Senator.’’’ None of us would be here 
today—the pages who are here, the 
Presiding Officer, the officers of the 
Senate—none of us would be here 
today. Thank God for the United 
States Senate. Thank God for the 
Great Compromise that was reached by 
the Framers on that day so long ago in 
Philadelphia. 

The Romans spoke of the SPQR— 
Senatus Populusque Romanus: The 
Senate and the Roman people. Let us 
today, looking back on that great victory 
of our Framers 214 years ago, 
think in those Roman terms about our 
own Republic—Senatus Populusque 
Americanus. 

Mr. REID. Before the Senator from 
West Virginia leaves the floor, I would 
like to say to him I watched most everything 
from my office and came to 
watch the finish. 

I remind the Senator, when you were 
the Democratic leader, you allowed 
this young freshman Senator to go to 
the 200th anniversary of the Great 
Compromise in Philadelphia. We took a 
train over there. I had just come from 
the House of Representatives. It was 
1987, as I recall. It was a wonderful experience 
to do the reenactment. You 
brought back many memories. 

I say to my friend, the distinguished 
Senator from West Virginia, presently 
many people in America are thinking 
about the Founding Fathers. The reason 
they are doing that is because of 
the great work David McCullough has 
written about John Adams, the forgotten 
President. It is on the best seller 
list. It is a straight history book, very 
well written. I still have about 70 or 80 
pages to go. But as I said, he is a man 

to whom we have not, until now, paid 
much attention. He was the first Vice 
President, the person who became our 
second President. He was involved from 
the very beginning with the very difficult 
decisions made by this country. 
He spent 7 years of his life in Europe. 
He had never traveled at all. He traveled 
to Europe, trying to work out 
things during the Revolutionary War. 
It is a wonderful story. 

Truth is stranger than fiction. As the 
Senator from West Virginia has so well 
portrayed here today, every day we 
should be thankful, in whatever private 
time we have. We should think about 
how fortunate we are to be able to be 
part of this Government and especially 
to be part of this Senate, which was 
the Great Compromise. 

I extend my appreciation to my 
friend for reminding us of how fortunate, 
how blessed we are to be able to 
be part of this Senate and to represent 
the people from the various States we 
represent. To think, as a result of this 
Great Compromise, we have developed 
a country that is certainly imperfect 
but, based on this tiny little document—
which, by the way, is signed by 
Robert C. Byrd—even though imperfect, 
is the finest set of standards, the 
finest country in the history of the 
world to rule the affairs of men and 
women. 

Again I express my deep appreciation 
to the Senator from West Virginia for 
tearing at my heart a little bit, recognizing 
what a real patriot is. The Senator 
from West Virginia exemplifies 
that. 

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my 
friend for his observations. 

He might well have sat in that gallery 
of men who debated, who disagreed, 
who compromised, who agreed, 
and who wrote that document. He cherishes 
it. He carries it in his pocket. 

Yes, I very well remember that occasion 
when we went to Philadelphia. Our 
friend, Senator DOMENICI, the Senator 
from New Mexico, was there that same 
day. 

Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, sir. 

Mr. BYRD. Yes, I remember that day. 
I am glad we three were blessed, among 
others, in our being able to attend that 
celebration in the City of Brotherly 
Love, on that august occasion. 

The Senator’s reference to David 
McCullough reminds me of what a 
great part women have played in the 
creation of this country. Senator REID 
has mentioned John Adams. John 
Adams’ best friend, his most trusted 
confident—and that is the way it 
should have been—was his wife, Abigail. 
Walt Whitman said: 

A man is a great thing upon the earth, and 
through eternity—but every jot of the greatness 
of man is unfolded out of woman. 

I am reading the book also. I have 
had three copies given to me, three 
copies of this new book by David 
McCullough, the book titled ‘‘John 
Adams.’’ 

He is, to a very considerable extent, 
in the shadows. Some years ago I read 

his ‘‘Thoughts On Government.’’ He 
distributed these writings to the Framers 
at the convention in those critical 
days, and the Framers, I think, were 
wise in reading the words by Adams 
and I think their work, their work 
product, reflected the thoughts of John 
Adams. 

One of the great books I have read in 
my lifetime was ‘‘The Path Between 
The Seas’’ by David McCullough, about 
the Panama Canal. David McCullough 
was kind enough to send me a copy of 
the book. The Senator who delivered it 
to me also autographed it. That Senator 
was Ted Kennedy. So I prize that 
book. But I thank the distinguished 
Senator from Nevada. 

Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield. 

I am glad you mentioned Abigail 
Adams for the wonderful letters the 
two of them wrote for each other. Here 
he was going to become President of 
the United States—he thought. He 
wasn’t quite sure, you will find, as you 
get through the book. He wound up 
winning that election by three votes 
over Thomas Jefferson. 

The letters from the very beginning, 
from Abigail to John, are wonderful. I 
mean, you could put those letters together—
I am sure we have only seen a 
few of them that David McCullough selected. 
But they were love letters. 
These two people were madly in love 
with each other from the time they 
started writing, when he went away to 
do his government stuff, clear across 
the ocean. They would wait months, 
sometimes, to get answers to letters 
they had written. But I was terribly 
struck by the letter she wrote to John 
Adams when he learned he was going to 
be President of the United States. In 
this letter she expressed her love for 
this man that she couldn’t bear to be 
away from, and that they would be together 
soon. 

So you are absolutely right. John 
Adams could not have made it but for 
Abigail. 

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator. 

Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator 
yield? 

Mr. BYRD. Yes, I am happy to yield. 

Mr. DOMENICI. I was present indeed 
at your invitation for that wonderful 
event. The reason I rise is to express to 
you what a great institution the Senate 
is, but the reason I say it to you is 
that over time you have, more than 
anyone else here, continually reminded 
people such as me what a great institution 
the Senate is. And you know, if 
you are not steeped in history, like I 
wasn’t, or if you really didn’t spend a 
lot of time other than in normal 
schooling on the constitutional framework, 
then you don’t know about the 
heroes of the Senate. You may only 
know that the Senate is over there in 
Washington. But, essentially, when the 
Senator from West Virginia and the 
Senator from New Mexico, about 6 or 7 
weeks ago got up on the floor and debated—
I think the Senator from West 
Virginia wanted 3 hours and got 3 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7671 

hours—on the issue of whether the 
Budget Act of the United States, a 
statute, in this instance, changed the 
basic Jeffersonian rules of the Senate 
or not, which the Senate voted with 
this Senator saying it did—50–49 is my 
recollection—I recall how passionate 
you were about reminding everyone 
what the rules of the Senate meant to 
the rights of the American people, to 
have their issues debated as long as the 
Senator, under the rules, could get 
them debated. 

Who would have thought that was an 
important thing, until you figure out 
what they really had in mind for the 
Senate. 

We are a very different institution 
than the House. Sometimes we get into 
arguments and deride each other—the 
House does this, the Senate does that, 
the upper and the lower, whatever the 
people say. But the truth is we are tied 
inextricably to the notion of there 
being sovereign States that make up 
America. 

As a Senator, you find a way to tie 
that into the Senate and what we do; 
to the fact that the States have a tremendous 
amount of authority and autonomy 
in the United States. That is 
the way it is and should be. You represent 
your State and I represent mine. 
In a very real sense, we are permitted 
to do that because of what our Founding 
Fathers sacrificed to put the Senate 
into this basic governance approach. 


Remind us, once again, of our origins 
and how important the Senate is, how 
much it was debated, of the great concern 
there was, and then to bring it 
current, as you do frequently, reminding 
us of what we are and who we are. 
I think it requires that somebody from 
way off in New Mexico congratulate 
you for how you do that. 

What you had to say about the Senate, 
not just today but over these 
years, will be for however long we exist 
and clearly will never be forgotten as 
part of our fabric. 

I am very pleased to be here as that 
fabric is woven by the distinguished 
Senator from West Virginia. 

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, a long 
time ago, I was a boy in the coal fields 
of southern West Virginia. My coal 
miner dad bought a fiddle for me. 
There was a lad in that coal mining 
community named Emanuel Manchini. 
I remember that little boy and his family. 
In those coal camps were Hungarian 
families, Czechoslovakians, Germans, 
Scotch, Italians, and Greeks. 
This little boy, Emanuel Manchini, 
also had a fiddle. We took lessons together 
at the high school. 

So I have often listened to and 
looked at my friend here—this man of 
Roman stock. My, what a heritage he 
has. I don’t know where his forbears 
may have originated—whether it was 
in the Apennines Mountains, or along 
the shore of the Tyrrhenian Sea, or the 
Adriatic or the Po Valleys, or on the 
boot of Italy. But there were stalwart 
people in that Roman Senate. I often 

speak to Senator DOMENICI about the 
Roman Senate; what a great Senate. 

Again, I refer to Majorian, the Emperor 
of the West in 457 A.D. As he was 
being made Emperor, he said he was ‘‘a 
prince who still glories in the name of 
‘Senator’.’’ 

I thank the Senator for his reminiscing 
time. I also thank the Senator 
from Nevada. I have been blessed by 
serving with both of these Senators.

2002—Continued 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Nevada. 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the 
matter now pending before the Senate? 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. H.R. 2311. 

AMENDMENT NO. 980 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the substitute 
amendment be agreed to, the bill, as 
amended, be considered original text 
for the purpose of further amendment, 
and that no points of order be waived 
by this request. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 

Without objection, it is so ordered. 

The clerk will report. 

The legislative clerk read as follows: 

The Senator from Nevada [Mr. REID] for 
Mr. BYRD and Mr. STEVENS, proposes an 
amendment numbered 980. 

(The text of the amendment is printed 
in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Amendments 
Submitted.’’) 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the amendment is 
agreed to. 

The amendment (No. 980) was agreed 
to. 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, this afternoon 
we begin consideration for the 
Fiscal Year 2002 Energy and Water Development 
Appropriations Act. The 
legislation we take up today was reported 
unanimously from the full Committee 
on Appropriations last Thursday. 


Before I begin my description of the 
contents of this bill, I want to share 
one strongly felt opinion with my colleagues. 
It is my opinion, I believe—I 
have a real suspicion that Senator 
DOMENICI, the ranking member of the 
subcommittee, will agree—that this 
subcommittee has always been among 
the most bipartisan in the Senate. 

As I look back over the time that my 
role was filled by Bennett Johnston, I 
know he and Senator DOMENICI had an 
outstanding relationship. They worked 

very closely together. This bill was always 
one of the first to come up. This 
bill is the second to come up this appropriations 
cycle. I have tried—and I 
have no doubt, based on my experience 
with Senator DOMENICI, that he has 
tried—to be as bipartisan as possible on 
this bill. Despite the unusual circumstances 
this year with the shift in 
power of the Senate, this tradition has 
continued unabated. 

My friend, the senior Senator from 
New Mexico, and I have, with the tireless 
efforts of our very professional and 
good staff, produced a bill that we acknowledge 
is not perfect. But it addresses 
the important issues facing our 
Nation. There are many important 
issues we are dealing with in this legislation. 


We received 300 more requests than 
last year on this bill. It is certainly 
fair to say that there have been over 
1,000. Most requests were to enhance 
new funding for water projects within 
the Corps of Engineers, an organization 
the administration cut by 14 percent in 
its budget request this year. We have 
done in this bill as much as we can on 
a bipartisan basis to enhance the funding 
for these water projects. 

Mr. President, you are a new member 
in the Senate. I think a lot of people 
who are new to the Senate and people 
outside the Senate would question 
water projects. Why do we need water 
projects? Are these things you throw to 
a House Member in his district to make 
him or her feel good? These water 
projects are essential to the country. 
There is criticism given to the water 
projects. We have added $400 million to 
the budget of the Corps of Engineers, 
$64 million to the Bureau of Reclamation. 


I wish we could give three times that 
much to each organization. But with 
these additional funds, we have tried to 
accommodate as many requests and 
priorities as possible. 

Let me give you a few examples of 
these water projects and why they are 
important. For the examples that I 
give, I will be very succinct. There are 
hundreds and hundreds of projects in 
this country that are life-and-death 
projects. 

One is in the State of Nevada: Flood 
control. There are people who write all 
over the country: REID got pork for Las 
Vegas; flood control. People think: It 
never rains in Las Vegas. It rains 4 
inches a year in Las Vegas—4 inches a 
year. You can get that much rain in 
other parts of the country in an hour, 
certainly in a day. But we get 4 inches 
a year in Las Vegas. Yet when it rains, 
it can be devastating because we have 
what we call cloudbursts. 

Now we have 1.5 million, 1.6 million 
people in that valley. When that rain 
comes, it is very difficult. I can remember 
as a lieutenant governor, we 
were told by the Park Service that we 
were going to have to close a little facility 
on the Colorado River, Nelson’s 
Landing. It has been there well over 100 
years. We were going to have to close 


S7672 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

it. The Governor assigned me to look 
at that and the complaints we were 
getting. We prevailed on the Park 
Service not to close it. They said we 
were going to have a 100-year flood. I 
went and talked to people and they 
said they had never known that much 
rain coming down that canyon: The 
Federal Government, they don’t know 
what they are talking about. 

Mr. President, it rained. This isn’t 
something I am proud of, but it is 
something that is a fact. It rained. It 
rained in a very small area. It rained 
very hard. But all of that water 
dumped down this canyon, and people 
looked up and they saw a wall of water 
100 feet high coming at them. It washed 
cars away. It killed seven people. We 
never found the cars and mobile homes 
that washed away. 

In southern Nevada, again Nelson’s 
Landing—but in Las Vegas we have had 
floods that have been just as devastating. 
We have not lost at one time 
seven lives but we have lost lives. 

Caesar’s Palace, this great resort—I 
can remember rains that washed away 
everything in the parking lot. It was 
just washed away as if they were toothpicks. 


The Tropicana-Flamingo Wash in Nevada 
is the fastest growing community 
in the Nation. We have been able to 
save lives and huge amounts of property 
by virtue of the fact we have flood 
control projects going on there as we 
speak. It has cost a lot of money, but 
we have saved a lot of lives; and that is 
for what the Federal Government has 
an obligation, to assist local governments. 
There has been local money put 
in it, too. 

The Everglades: I have seen the Everglades. 
I really do not understand them 
because I understand the desert. I understand 
aridity. I understand when it 
does not rain much. I understand out of 
my little home in Searchlight I have 
creosote bushes that are not very tall 
that are 100 years old. They do not 
grow very much. So I do not really understand 
the Everglades. I am fascinated 
by them. But it is water intensive. 
It is as water intensive as the 
desert is not water intensive. 

We have worked hard with the Senators 
from Florida on a project-byproject 
basis to take care of that. It is 
now a huge priority not only of the 
Congress, as it has been in the past, but 
of the administration. I think part of 
that could be that Jeb Bush is Governor. 
It does not matter. It is an important 
project that the Federal Government 
should be involved in—and we 
are. There is a lot of money in this bill 
for the Everglades. 

Not far from where we stand is the 
Chesapeake Bay. Books have been written 
about the Chesapeake Bay. It is a 
wonder of nature. But because of the 
growth that is occurring in this area, 
the Chesapeake Bay has been threatened. 
The health of that great body of 
water has been threatened. It affects 
Maryland and Virginia very much. The 
bay is threatened as a natural resource. 


Senators MIKULSKI, SARBANES, WARNER, 
and ALLEN have aggressively 
sought money to restore that waterway 
to what it used to be so oysters can be 
harvested there and not make people 
sick. The oyster industry in Maryland 
and Virginia is huge, but it has not 
been as huge recently because of the 
condition of that bay. The restoration 
of the beds at relatively low cost, we 
believe, will ultimately generate hundreds 
of millions of dollars in economic 
benefit and jobs. This is a water 
project. 

The Port of Los Angeles: We move 
from the Chesapeake Bay 3,000 miles to 
the Port of Los Angeles. The administration 
had made a decision to stretch 
this out. The problem we have found 
with these promises is that even 
though it sounds OK, you stretch it out 
and it winds up costing much more 
money. You are better off doing less 
projects and doing them well. Congress 
has funded this project very aggressively 
and has saved the Federal Government 
25 percent of the total project 
cost and has accelerated the economic 
benefits to California. 

So these are just four examples of 
water projects. But there are many 
more. I am happy we have worked together 
with our members, our Senators, 
and, of course, many requests 
from people in the House, to do what 
we could with these projects. 

Even with the additional funding the 
committee has added, we are still hundreds 
of millions of dollars shy of current 
year levels. We are also shy of the 
House mark. The other body was able 
to artificially raise their numbers for 
the Foreign Bureau by moving defense 
dollars in these nondefense accounts. 
We cannot do that. Under Senate rules, 
we cannot do that. In my opinion, not 
only the budget resolution but common 
sense does not allow us and should not 
allow us to move these funds back and 
forth. 

But I will say to everyone who is listening, 
in the past, the water numbers 
have always gotten better for everyone 
as we have moved along the process; 
that is, we hope we can do a better job 
when we get to conference. There is no 
guarantee of that, but we will work on 
that. 

Our bill provides about $25 billion in 
budget authority and approximately 
$24.7 billion in outlays. When you work 
with Senator DOMENICI, you always 
have to make sure the outlays are 
smaller than the budget authority. 
This bill exceeds the President’s total 
request by $2.6 billion. 

Let’s talk about a few of the areas. 
The Army Corps of Engineers: The Senate 
bill provides $4.3 billion, which is 
$405 million above the President’s request 
but $236 million below the current 
year level. Due to the funding constraints, 
this bill contains no new construction 
starts and no new environmental 
infrastructure projects. 

The intent in drafting the bill was to 
continue to focus on ongoing construction 
and operations and maintenance 

projects at appropriate levels. The 
committee is eager to avoid stretching 
out schedules and costs on projects 
that are already underway. Any new 
construction starts will have to be considered 
in conference. We will do what 
we can at that time. 

A lot of people are very concerned 
about things they want to do. I have a 
lot of familiarity with the Bureau of 
Reclamation because they have had 
such a big presence in the State of Nevada. 
The very first project in the history 
of the Bureau of Reclamation was 
called the New Lands Project in 1902. It 
took place in Nevada. It is still there. 
The Senate’s bill provides $884 million, 
which is $64 million above the President’s 
request and $67 million above 
the current year level. 

This funding for the Bureau is higher 
than it has been for many years. It is 
higher because of CALFED. This is a 
big project in California. It is a reclamation 
project. The State of California 
has spent billions of dollars on it 
already. The House put nothing in the 
bill for that. Senator DOMENICI and I 
put $40 million in this bill for the 
CALFED and CALFED-related 
projects. The subcommittee has funded 
CALFED-related projects using existing 
authorizations under other accounts. 
Senators FEINSTEIN and BOXER 
have both been very tireless advocates 
for the Bay-Delta Program. Senator 
DOMENICI and I are both delighted to 
provide substantial funding. 

The Department of Energy: We in Nevada 
have great familiarity with the 
Department of Energy. Nevada has 
been the place for 50 years where almost 
1,000 nuclear devices have been 
set off in the desert—most of them underground 
but not all of them. I know 
about the Department of Energy. This 
bill contains over $20 billion for the Department 
of Energy. This is $2.1 billion 
over the level of the President’s request 
and $1.9 billion over last year’s 
level. Most of this additional funding is 
being used to provide adequate funding 
for the National Nuclear Security Administration, 
to enhance funding for 
the Environmental Management Program, 
and to add funding for the renewable 
energy program. 

Senator DOMENICI and I have received 
a letter signed by nearly two-thirds of 
our colleagues calling for more money 
for renewable energy programs. Our 
bill takes care of that. Our bill provides 
$435 million, or $160 million above 
the President’s request and $60 million 
above the current year level. In a year 
when our Nation has struggled with energy 
production and distribution 
issues, I am pleased to be able to enhance 
funding levels for these important 
research and development issues. 

Consistent with the budget resolution, 
this bill provides $6.1 billion to 
the National Nuclear Security Administration 
for stockpile stewardship activities. 
This funding is $705 million 
over the President’s request and $1.05 
billion over the current year level. I 
am only going to speak a little while 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7673 

about the National Nuclear Security 
Administration, known as NNSA. I 
defer to Senator DOMENICI on this subject. 
Senator DOMENICI was the primary 
congressional architect of the 
creation of the National Nuclear Security 
Administration. He worked tirelessly 
to get it authorized and has been 
dogged in his pursuit of funding to 
make sure that this important organization 
gets the resources it needs to 
succeed. To his credit, he convinced his 
colleagues on the Budget Committee 
that the safeguarding and rehabilitation 
of the Nation’s nuclear weapons 
was a critical issue that has been 
underadressed and underfunded in recent 
years. Senators BYRD and STEVENS 
followed up with appropriation resources 
designed to support the levels 
in the budget resolution. 

This morning I spoke to the interns 
for Senators LINCOLN and HUTCHINSON 
of Arkansas. I don’t know how many 
interns there were—maybe 50—a lot of 
young men and women. One of the 
young people asked me: What do you 
think is the most important problem 
facing the world? I thought for a 
minute. I said: Nuclear weapons. I really 
do believe that with the deteriorating 
condition of the former Soviet 
Union, Russia’s nuclear stockpile, and 
the responsibilities we have, that is a 
very important issue. I can’t think of 
anything more important for my 
grandchildren than to make sure they 
live in a safe world. 

One of these weapons that we control 
and certainly one that the Soviet 
Union controls could accidentally go 
off. It would be devastating. It would 
make Chernobyl look like nothing. 
Chernobyl was just a nuclear reactor 
gone bad. We are talking about a nuclear 
weapon gone bad. I believe that is 
the No. 1 problem facing the world. We 
have a number of different ways of addressing 
it. We have to spend more 
money on terrorism. There are efforts 
being made for a nuclear shield for this 
country. But what we are talking 
about in this bill is doing what we can 
to make our nuclear stockpile safe and 
reliable. Our bill spends some money, 
maybe not enough, to work on the Russians 
to see if we can help them. 

I have to admit, I was a skeptic when 
Senator DOMENICI and others approached 
me about the creation of this 
autonomous organization several years 
ago. I thought it was a partisan ploy to 
maybe embarrass the administration. 
But as it turned out, it is working very 
well. I have come to believe Senator 
DOMENICI was right. 

One of the people who has done a 
good job of convincing me of that is the 
person running that agency. We as a 
country, as a world, are so fortunate 
that a retired general would take 
charge of this operation. He believes in 
it. He is a very competent, dedicated, 
patriotic American. With him heading 
this office, we should all go to sleep at 
night resting well that everything possible 
is being done to make sure we do 
have a safe and reliable nuclear stock


pile. I am going to do everything I can 
to give him the resources he needs to 
do his job. He has a job that is very difficult. 


I am also, of course, holding him accountable 
for getting the job done. I 
have been a long-time critic of cost 
overruns and management incompetence 
within the weapons complex. I 
know General Gordon will take these 
enhanced resources and use them to 
get some fresh blood and fresh thinking 
going on within the Department of Energy. 


I am not going to go into more detail. 
I know Senator DOMENICI will 
speak about this, since this is his so-
called baby. It has grown up and is 
about to become a teenager. It is something 
to which the Senator can speak 
with more authority than I. 

Finally, I am very pleased to report 
that the committee has made great 
strides in restoring and enhancing the 
devastating cuts made in the Environmental 
Management Program at DOE. 
This Senate bill provides $7.23 billion, 
$900 million above the President’s request 
and $450 million above the current 
level. The biggest beneficiaries of 
these additional clean-up dollars are 
the Hanford, Washington site, hundreds 
of millions of dollars; Savannah River 
site, almost $200 million, that is in 
South Carolina; Idaho, over $150 million; 
Ohio and Kentucky, tens of millions 
of dollars. 

As with water programs, I realize 
there are never enough resources we 
can spend to clean up the legacy of the 
cold war and other activities, but we 
have done our best. 

These are some of the highlights, 
from my perspective, of this bill. It is 
a bill I have learned to like. It is a bill 
I have grown to understand. I have 
grown to acknowledge the importance 
it has to our country. I hope my colleagues 
will realize how hard we have 
worked on this legislation. 

Senator DOMENICI and I would like to 
have a cutoff time for the filing of 
amendments. We tried tomorrow at 11 
and 12, and we have received objections 
to that. We are here. If somebody 
wants to offer amendments, they can 
certainly do that. They have to have 
offsets or figure out some way to fund 
them because we are down to the nubs. 
We have no more money. If people 
don’t like the way we have worked the 
bill, it is their privilege to come forward 
with amendments. 

I do think it would be in everyone’s 
interest to have a finite list of amendments 
filed at an appropriate time. If 
anyone has any suggestions when that 
should be, Senator DOMENICI and I are 
open for discussion. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from New Mexico. 

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me 
first acknowledge the wonderful cooperation 
that exists between the 
chairman and this Senator as ranking 
member. I believe under the circumstances 
and considering the variety 
of things this subcommittee has to 

fund, we have done a pretty good job. I 
couldn’t ask for more understanding 
than I have received from the distinguished 
Senator, the chairman of this 
subcommittee. 

I believe our staff has worked together, 
and I hope I have been equally 
considerate and concerned about issues 
of importance to the good Senator 
from Nevada. 

As a result of this effort, we are together 
in trying to get this bill passed 
and get it off to conference and getting 
these issues resolved as soon as possible. 


Let me say to my good friend, he was 
talking about a flood that occurred in 
the State of Nevada in one of those dry 
rivers where for most of the year no 
water runs. But then you have a little 
cloudburst up in the mountains and 
these dry rivers turn into flooded, huge 
water resources plowing down the hills 
right into housing. In our State we call 
these dry rivers a Spanish name, 
‘‘arroyos.’’ 

In my home city of Albuquerque, I 
was pleased to serve 4 years as the city 
councilman, sort of chairman of the 
commission, which made me the closest 
thing to a mayor as you could have. 
I remember one Sunday afternoon in 
the year 1968. I was very young. I had 
just been on this council as chairman 
for awhile. It started raining Sunday 
afternoon. I called up one of my good 
friends on the city council who knew 
more about the details of the streets 
and everything else than anybody in 
the city. 

I called him up and said, ‘‘Harry, this 
rain is coming down in the wrong 
places; something is going to happen.’’ 
He said, ‘‘Where are you?’’ He picked 
me up and we rode around. Rain kept 
coming down harder and harder, and 
these dry rivers started to show a little 
trickle. Four hours later, we were 
riding the streets of Albuquerque and 
big manhole covers over the tunnels 
that carried water underground to 
avoid floods were standing or dancing 
on the water. The water raised those 
man holes up 4 or 5 feet and stood them 
up while the place got flooded. We saw 
more and more of them. I told my 
friend, ‘‘This is a real problem.’’ He 
said, ‘‘No, things will be all right.’’ Finally, 
2 hours later, we got a call from 
the police chief. He said that in one 
whole piece of our city, maybe as many 
as 10,000 homes were under water. They 
had water in the kitchens, close to the 
tops of the stoves. It was a gigantic 
flow of water that came down these dry 
arroyos. 

I remember coming here with a group 
of Albuquerqueans. I was city councilman 
then. We appeared before the Public 
Works Committee, which had to authorize 
the project after which it went 
on to get appropriated. We came up to 
ask if the Federal Government would 
expand a program that was about to 
run out so we could build these rivers 
so they would be safe. Now if one flies 
over Albuquerque, as you approach the 
airport you see two giant cement waterways 
that are around the edges of 


S7674 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

the town—huge. They catch the water 
in these dry rivers up by the mountain 
and run them down these no longer dry 
rivers, but they are cement-lined 
ditches, big ones. Water comes down, 
and now you can be riding around and 
your commissioner friend Harry can 
say, ‘‘It is raining hard, Mr. Chairman,’’ 
and you can say, ‘‘It might hurt 
something else, but it won’t flood anymore.’’ 


That is the kind of thing we pay for 
in this bill for hundreds of places 
across America. We hope we get them 
before they flood, but sometimes we 
don’t. Sometimes we pay for them 
after they flood. But to make sure we 
are not building white elephants, we 
require a very substantial match. The 
community has to come up with 
money. That is the way we finally decide 
it must be important, because 
they are not just asking us to have a 
construction project, they are going to 
pay for part of it. 

My good friend, the chairman, outlined 
water issues. Clearly, there is no 
end to the requests in our country for 
this. But we have the rule: We don’t 
fund them unless they have been authorized. 
The committee has to work 
on them and have hearings. That bothers 
a lot of our Senators because there 
is such a backlog of existing authorized 
programs that we don’t catch up very 
often. We have many billions backlogged 
that we can’t pay for. But we 
will keep working on it. 

Overall, the proposed fiscal year 2002 
energy and water bill is a very fair and 
balanced bill that makes important investments 
in our national security, our 
energy security, our economic prosperity, 
and in the health of our environment. 
This bill is an important step 
in implementing the President’s National 
Energy Policy. 

The Senate bill in total provides $25 
billion in budget authority and approximately 
$24.7 billion in outlays. 
The bill exceeds the President’s request 
by $2.6 billion, and exceeds the House 
bill by $1.4 billion. Without going into 
detail about all of the many great 
things in this bill, I would like to focus 
my remarks on two broad areas: (1) 
What this bill does for our energy security, 
and (2) What this bill does for our 
national security. 

For our nation’s energy security, this 
bill represents a major step in fulfilling 
the President’s commitment to a balanced 
and diversified energy policy— 
particularly in the area of expanding 
the supply of clean energy from renewable 
sources and nuclear power. 

But before If focus specifically on 
what this bill does in those two areas, 
I want to take this opportunity to dispel 
two persistent myths that have 
been unfairly associated with the 
President’s National Energy Policy. 
First, that the policy focuses only on 
supply and ignores conservation and efficiency. 
And second, that the policy 
fails to address the possible threat of 
global warming. 

The policy is so clear on the first 
point that those who argue simply 

haven’t read it. There are more policy 
recommendations impacting conservation 
and efficiency than supply. Over $6 
billion in proposed tax reductions are 
targeted at conservation and efficiency. 


Furthermore, the whole policy is 
based on substantial gains from improvements 
in conservation and efficiency. 
If we maintained the current 
ratio between energy demand and the 
gross domestic product (GDP), we 
would need 77 percent more energy in 
2020 than we are producing today—77 
percent more. The National Energy 
Policy recommends conservation and 
efficiency measures that would reduce 
the required increase by over half—resulting 
in us only needing to produce 29 
percent more energy by 2020. That is a 
substantial but necessary commitment 
to conversation and efficiency. 

Let me turn to that second myth, 
that the policy doesn’t address the possible 
threat of global warming. Once 
again, those who have read the policy 
shouldn’t make that statement. The 
policy has strong support for clean energy 
sources. 

Renewable sources are encouraged in 
many ways, including tax credits for 
wind, biomass, solar, and the purchase 
of clean fuel vehicles. The policy supports 
a major research program in 
clean-coal technologies, advocates increased 
funding for renewable energy 
R&D and recognizes nuclear energy for 
its very positive environmental benefits. 


It is in these last two areas, renewable 
energy and nuclear energy, that 
the energy and water bill takes a major 
step in implementing the President’s 
national energy policy. 

The renewable energy programs are 
funded in this bill at $435 million. 
That’s $60 million and 16 percent above 
the current year level. There’s no question 
that renewable sources can and 
should play a larger role in our energy 
supply, and this budget will accelerate 
progress towards that vision. 

Within that renewable budget, several 
programs are slated for major increases. 
Just to give a few examples: 

Research on hydrogen-based technologies 
is up almost 30 percent over 
last year. That research may lead to 
decreased use of petroleum products in 
transportation, certainly a critical 
goal. 

Research on high temperature superconductivity 
is boosted by almost 20 
percent. That’s a technology that may 
enable dramatic reduction of losses we 
now experience in electric transmission 
lines and motors. 

Geothermal research is 20 percent 
above last year and wind systems are 
up more than 10 percent. 

Nuclear energy received significant 
increases as well in this bill. I strongly 
agree with the President’s National 
Energy Policy in its recommendation 
supporting the expansion of nuclear energy 
in the United States. Nuclear 
plants offer emission-free power 
sources, help maintain diversity of fuel 

supply, enhance energy security, meet 
growing electricity demand, and protect 
consumers against volatility in 
the electricity and natural gas markets. 


This bill pushes nuclear power forward 
with a number of important initiatives: 


The bill includes $19 million for university 
research reactor support—an 
increase of $7 million over current 
year—to make sure our country has 
the educational resources necessary for 
an economy that continues to rely substantially 
on nuclear power. 

The bill includes $9 million—an increase 
of $4 million over current year— 
to expand a program to improve the reliability 
and productivity of our 103 existing 
nuclear power plants. 

The bill continues the highly successful 
Nuclear Energy Research Initiative 
(NERI) at $38 million—$3 million more 
than current year. 

The bill provides $14 million—an increase 
of $7 million—to continue work 
begun last year on advanced reactor 
development, including research on 
generation IV reactors—reactors that 
will be passively safe, produce less 
waste, and reduce any proliferation 
concerns. 

The bill provides $10 million for the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to 
prepare to license new nuclear power 
plants. 

The bill continues an R&D program 
we started two years ago on ways to reduce 
the quantity and toxicity of spent 
nuclear fuel—called ‘‘transmutation’’. 
This technology, which was recently 
highlighted in the President’s National 
Energy Policy, will be continued at $70 
million in 2002. 

Let me emphasize that I used the 
phrase ‘‘spent fuel’’ rather than 
‘‘waste’’ to refer to the materials coming 
out of our reactors. Right now our 
national policy calls for disposing of 
those materials as waste in a future repository. 
But we need to remember 
that these materials still contain 95 
percent of their initial energy content. 

I’ve been concerned for years that it 
is highly debatable for us to decide 
that future generations will have no 
need for this rich energy source. With 
improved management strategies, possibly 
involving reprocessing and transmutation, 
we can recycle that material 
for possible later use, recover far more 
of the energy, and dramatically reduce 
the toxicity and volume of the materials 
that are finally declared to be 
waste. 

As a final thought on energy security, 
Mr. President, I want to share 
with my Senate colleagues a vision, 
which is encompassed in this bill and 
which I’ve shared with President Bush. 

We need to reach beyond the debate 
over Kyoto with a blueprint that provides 
the tools to combat global warming. 


I’m convinced that we can have 
growth and prosperity in America 
without global warming. 

And I’m equally convinced that we 
can help provide those same benefits 
for the world. 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7675 

I propose that we provide worldwide 
leadership to eliminate the threat of 
global warming by a commitment to 
prosperity and growth through clean 
energy. 

And I further propose that we accomplish 
this goal through partnerships 
with our friends and allies, especially 
those in developing countries. 

I’ve specifically urged the President 
to lead this new initiative, to accelerate 
our own research and build international 
partnerships for joint development 
of all the clean sources of energy—
renewables, clean fossil fuels, 
nuclear energy, and hydrogen-based 
fuels. Then as we transition to improved 
technologies in the future, our 
partner nations will also be building up 
their energy infrastructure with the 
latest and cleanest technologies. 

Last year’s energy and water development 
bill called for improvements in 
the federal government’s role in international 
development, demonstration, 
and deployment of advanced clean energy 
technologies. 

With this new bill and the President’s 
policy, our nation is developing 
a suite of energy supplies that will provide 
us with clean, reliable, economic 
energy far into the future. But I continue 
to believe that we should be looking 
beyond our own borders. 

I submit that we should be seizing 
every opportunity to help the developing 
nations around the world achieve 
much higher standards of living. They 
simply can’t do that without reliable 
electricity supplies. 

Each nation will make their own 
choices for fuel sources, exploiting 
their own strengths. We have abundant 
natural gas—and it will make a huge 
contribution to a cleaner future for our 
country. But every nation needs diverse 
energy supplies, not a singular 
reliance on one source. Other nations 
may be well positioned to exploit their 
solar or wind resources—through this 
program these nations can make the 
choices best for their needs. 

The leadership shown by Senator 
BYRD on clean coal technologies 
matches this vision very well. Some 
other nation’s have immense coal resources, 
through this vision they can 
benefit by Senator BYRD’s efforts to advance 
clean coal technologies. 

We can leave the poorest countries to 
their own resources to develop whatever 
energy they can, or we can offer 
substantial help to partner with these 
nations to help them develop sources 
that are not only reliable and reasonably 
priced, but also clean. 

It’s strongly in our self interest to do 
this. After all, we all share the same 
air. And in addition, countries with 
strong economies are our best choice 
for trading partners 

Mr. President, let me state again how 
proud I am to have worked on this bill 
with Senator REID. With this bill, we’ll 
be making real progress on the technologies 
to fuel our, and perhaps the 
world’s economies of the future. 

For our nation’s national security, 
this bill makes a major investment in 

solving serious problems in the nuclear 
weapons complex. With the leadership 
and resources included in this bill, 
many of those problems are going to 
get fixed. 

The bill includes $6.05 billion for the 
nuclear weapons (stockpile stewardship) 
activities of the NNSA, that is 
$705 million over the President’s request, 
$925 million over the House 
level, and $1.05 billion over the current 
year level. 

I want to again commend Senator 
REID, and our full committee chairman, 
first Senator STEVENS and Now 
Senator BYRD, for recognizing the serious 
problems in the nuclear weapons 
complex and providing the resources to 
fix those problems. 

This bill makes three major improvements 
on the President’s budget request 
for nuclear weapons. 

First, infrastructure. We know from 
the subcommittee’s hearing on infrastructure 
earlier this year, that our 
nuclear weapons facilities have degraded 
to the point that it will take 
billions of dollars to modernize for the 
future. 

The average age of the facilities 
where we do nuclear weapons work is 
over 40 years. 

We will need to spend an additional 
$300–$500 million a year for the next 17 
years over currently planned levels to 
refurbish the weapons complex to perform 
its basic mission. These expenditures 
will be required even if the nuclear 
stockpile is dramatically smaller. 

If we do not take action on these infrastructure 
problems immediately, we 
will not be able to meet the Department 
of Defense schedules for refurbishing 
three main weapons systems 
representing over 50 percent of our 
stockpile. We will not have the scientific 
facilities required to certify 
weapons. Our technicians and scientists 
will continue to work in unsafe 
facilities-increasing health risks and 
the number of safety related shutdowns. 


Although the work must begin immediately, 
the budget request included no 
funds to begin such an initiative. 
Therefore, the bill before the Senate 
includes $300 million to begin a major 
facilities improvement program in fiscal 
year 2002 at facilities in South 
Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri, Texas, 
New Mexico, Nevada, and California. 

The second major improvement on 
the administration’s budget request is 
that the bill provides additional funding 
to rebuild current weapons. 

The average age of weapons in the 
stockpile is now approaching 18 years— 
most were designed for a life of no 
more than 20 years. Many weapons 
components degrade substantially over 
time and have to be replaced. The 
Joint Department of Defense/NNSA 
Nuclear Weapons Council has recognized 
the fact that most of our weapons 
will have to be rebuilt, but funds were 
not requested to do so. 

Therefore, the bill includes an additional 
$295 million in fiscal year 2002 to 

get the NNSA on track to rebuild 
weapons on the schedule required by 
the Department of Defense. 

The third major improvement on the 
President’s request is that this bill 
fully funds pit production on the required 
schedule. 

We must soon have the capability to 
produce plutonium pits for weapons, a 
capability we lost when Rocky Flats 
was closed down in 1989. Plutonium 
pits are the ‘‘triggers’’ for nuclear 
weapons, that occasionally must be replaced. 
Today, we are the only nuclear 
power without the ability to produce 
them. The budget request puts off indefinitely 
our ability to deliver a certified 
pit to the military, but this bill 
adds $110 million to get the program 
back on track. 

Finally, there are a series of programs 
at NNSA that may be just as important 
to eliminating or controlling 
the global nuclear danger—these programs 
are to reduce the threat of nuclear 
weapon proliferation around the 
world. 

The administration proposed deep 
cuts in this area for fiscal year 2002, 
even though a blue-ribbon review led 
by Senator Howard Baker and Lloyd 
Cutler recently concluded . . . 

The most urgent unmet national security 
threat to the United States today is the danger 
that weapons of mass destruction or 
weapon-usable material in Russia could be 
stolen and sold to terrorists or hostile nation 
states and used against American troops 
abroad or citizens at home. 

The report also concluded that . . . 

Current nonproliferation programs of the 
DOE . . . have achieved impressive results 
thus far, but their limited mandate and funding 
fall short of what is required to address 
adequately the threat. 

I am pleased that this bill adds over 
$100 million to the important nonproliferation 
work the NNSA carries 
out in Russia and other countries of 
the former Soviet Union. These programs 
to control the material and expertise 
necessary to make weapons of 
mass destruction address problems 
identified as ‘‘the most urgent unmet 
national security threat to the United 
States today.’’ 

Once again, Senator REID, I want to 
commend you for a balanced bill. I do 
not agree with every aspect of the bill, 
but I cannot urgue with the fair manner 
in which you have put it together. 

I strongly support the bill, and urge 
all Members of the Senate to do likewise. 


Let me proceed as quickly as I can to 
summarize this bill. First, I am very 
pleased to join with Chairman REID in 
considering this fiscal year 2002 Energy 
and Water bill. I note that in the chair 
is a new Senator. I would think that he 
might wonder what in the world is an 
appropriation bill called Energy and 
Water. Well, my good friend, the new 
Senator from New Jersey, will never 
sit down and rationally decide what is 
in this bill. What is in it has been decided 
between the House and Senate as 
one of the 13 subcommittees of appropriation, 
and there is no rationale to 


S7676 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

it. In it we fund water development 
projects, flood protection projects, the 
harbors and rivers that need the Federal 
Government to help. But on the 
other end, believe it or not, the entire 
nuclear weapons development, preservation, 
and research for nuclear weapons 
is also funded in this bill. It doesn’t 
come under the rubric of energy. Why 
is it here? It is here because that kind 
of activity was brought to the Energy 
Department when the Energy Department 
was created. This subcommittee 
pays for that. 

So, overall, this is a very balanced 
bill. It covers what I have alluded to. I 
have great detail with me about what 
has concerned us and why we have had 
to fund the part of this that is for nuclear 
weaponry at a higher level than 
the President. I am very hopeful that 
the staff at the White House and the 
staff at OMB, who have looked at this 
since putting their budget out, will understand 
that some of this new money 
we had to put into the part of this bill 
that concerns itself with a safe and reliable 
nuclear stockpile. And remember, 
Mr. President, every time you say 
that, you can put a parenthesis in and 
you can say, without underground testing, 
because we have voted not to test 
underground. If you test, it makes it 
much easier to determine safety, to determine 
reliability. But we have determined 
we are not going to do that, and 
still we are going to spend money and 
put the finest resources in America to 
work on the science and physics and 
computerization part of maintaining 
this very, very serious and almost unbelievable 
thing called the American 
nuclear weapons stockpile. 

My good friend, Senator REID, has 
been a marvelous student of this. We 
have all had to learn together. I have 
more of a genuine parochial reason, because 
two of the three laboratories frequently 
called the nuclear laboratories—
not exactly the right name— 
are in my State. There is Los Alamos. 
Everybody knows that is where we did 
our first nuclear weaponry work— 
atomic weapon work. It was a mountain, 
but there is a city there now. In 
Albuquerque is Sandia Labs, an engineering 
laboratory, which is part of 
this. The third one is in the State of 
California. The three of them do much 
in addition to the work on nuclear. 
There are great researchers who are on 
the cutting edge of much of the science 
of the future in terms of energy needs 
and the like. So that is in this bill. 

And then, obviously, since it is an energy 
bill, it has an awful lot in it about 
the energy research and development 
that is occurring in the Department of 
Energy. First, let me quickly say that 
part of this is the implementation of 
energy policy. 

While we are still waiting around to 
debate and pass judgment on whether 
we are going to have some tax incentives 
that the President asked for in 
terms of developing new and different 
kinds of energy called ‘‘renewables,’’ or 
whether or not we are going to decide 

to open up more of the public domain 
to the development of gas and oil; in 
this bill, we get along with getting 
some of these things paid for and done, 
which everybody knows we should be 
doing. But it is most interesting—and 
this is an opportunity to speak for a 
moment about the President’s energy 
policy in one regard. There is a lot said 
about: what about conservation, and 
what about saving our energy? I am reminded 
that in preparation for this activity, 
in marking up this bill, I chose 
to read the President’s policy in its entirety. 
I want to cite one piece, because 
there is a lot said about there not 
being enough conservation in this policy, 
not enough things that push us to 
conserve and save. Well, I have come to 
the following conclusion, and if I am 
wrong, anybody that would like to read 
the policy and discuss it, I would be 
glad to do so. 

As this energy policy tells us what 
we need in the future, up to the year 
2020, it says that we could have to 
produce 77 percent more to meet our 
needs over this next 20 years—just for 
reasonable needs. But would you believe 
that a huge portion of that possible 
need is projected to come from 
conservation and saving energy, such 
that, of the 77 percent, only 29 percent 
is from new production? So if you do 
the arithmetic and subtract them, it is 
pretty obvious that there is a very 
large amount that is expected by way 
of either legislation or conduct in our 
country to save and conserve energy, 
along with increasing production of 
various types of energy. 

Let me talk about one. I am very 
pleased that both Senator REID and I 
and our staffs worked very hard on 
what’s called renewable energy programs. 
Because of the Senator’s dedication 
and us working together on this, 
we are funding the renewable energy 
programs at $435 million in this bill. 
That is 16 percent higher than this 
year. There is no question that renewable 
resources can and should play a 
larger role in our energy supply, and 
we push that or accelerate that in this 
bill. Within this renewable budget, several 
programs are slated for major increases, 
and I am going to tick some of 
them off. 

Hydrogen-based technology is up 30 
percent over last year. Some people 
think this whole area of hydrogen-
originated energy sources is one of our 
real solutions to clean and healthy production 
of energy without having any 
adverse impact on global warming. The 
research may lead to a decrease in the 
use of petroleum products in transportation. 


We also have superconductivity and 
geothermal, both have 20-percent increases. 
All of these can have an incremental 
positive impact on helping us 
meet our energy needs without having 
a major impact on global warming in 
the future. 

Incidentally, the President has suggested 
we should move ahead with nuclear 
and not abandon it. Nuclear en


ergy has received a significant increase 
in this bill. I strongly agree with the 
President’s national energy policy and 
his recommendations supporting the 
expansion of nuclear energy in the 
United States. 

I will state once—and if I have a 
chance I will do it a number of times— 
nuclear power in its current form and 
future generations, new generations, of 
nuclear powerplants do not contribute 
to global warming. In other words, the 
future is protected from the global 
warming pollution that comes from 
many of our traditional energy sources 
so that the evolution, development, 
and research in the areas of nuclear 
power can move us ahead in such a way 
as to provide energy for growth, development, 
and prosperity for America 
and for our industrial friends in the 
world and, yes, indeed, for those countries 
which do not yet have much of an 
economic base. 

We can produce clean energy for the 
future. With renewables, nuclear, and 
other forms of energy joining together, 
we can say to the world: You can grow 
and prosper. The poor countries will 
have an equal opportunity to do that, 
and we will not have to reduce growth, 
we will not have to put on caps, we will 
just have to use our ingenuity and 
science better. 

There are a number of things we did 
to let America take a good, solid look 
at what the next generation of nuclear 
powerplants or even the next one after 
that might look like and how it will 
help. 

I want to share with my friend, Senator 
REID, and those who are paying attention 
to what we are doing today, a 
portion of my comments today which I 
choose to call ‘‘Reaching Beyond 
Kyoto.’’ I, frankly, believe the President 
of the United States has a rare opportunity 
to lead the world beyond 
Kyoto. 

I say to my fellow Senators, I have 
talked to the President about this very 
issue. I have suggested it is a rare opportunity 
for him to lead the world in 
reaching beyond Kyoto, and I will talk 
about that for a minute. 

This is a vision, and part of it is in 
this bill because this is what we do in 
this bill. It says that we need to reach 
beyond the debate over Kyoto with a 
blueprint that provides tools to combat 
global warming. Further, we should 
ask the world to join as our partners 
and move ahead, 

I am convinced we can have growth 
and prosperity in America without 
global warming. I am equally convinced 
we can help provide these same 
benefits for the world. I propose we 
provide worldwide leadership to eliminate 
the threat of global warming by a 
commitment to prosperity and growth 
through clean energy, and I further 
propose we accomplish this goal 
through partnerships with our friends 
and allies, especially those in developing 
countries. 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7677 

I have specifically urged the President 
to lead this new initiative to accelerate 
our research and build international 
partnerships for joint development 
of all clean sources of energy—renewables, 
clean fossil fuels which our 
distinguished chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee, Senator BYRD, 
alludes to frequently as it relates to 
coal—nuclear energy, and hydrogen-
based fuels. 

As we transition to improved technologies 
in the future, our partner nations 
will also be building up their energy 
infrastructure with the latest and 
cleanest technologies. And, yes, there 
is no question, then, that we can send 
a message that the poor countries in 
the world can grow and prosper. As a 
matter of fact, they, too, can participate 
in this abundance of growth and 
prosperity for their people without adversely 
affecting global warming. 

Last year’s energy and water development 
bill called for improvements in 
the Federal Government’s role in international 
development, demonstration, 
and advanced clean energy technologies. 


With this new bill which is before the 
Senate, and the President’s policy, our 
Nation is developing a suite of energy 
supplies that will provide us with 
clean, reliable, economic energy for the 
future. 

I continue to believe we should be 
looking beyond our own borders. I submit 
that we should be seizing every opportunity 
to help the developing nations 
around the world achieve much 
higher standards of living. They simply 
cannot do that without reliable electrical 
supplies. I believe we can help 
them with this global approach of partnerships 
around the world to develop 
this technology and produce the next 
generation of nuclear powerplants. But 
we should not start on that path unless 
we set the goals for achievement of 
what they will look like, what they 
will do, and what they will not do. 

It is the same with clean coal technology: 
Set the goals and then let’s 
achieve them in this world so we can 
all grow and prosper. We all know we 
have an abundance of energy supplies 
in our country. We have natural gas. 
And it will make a huge contribution 
for our country. But every nation 
needs diverse energy supplies, not a 
singular reliance on a single source. 

Leadership has been shown by Senator 
BYRD with clean coal technologies 
that match this vision very well. Some 
other nations have immense coal resources. 
Through this vision, they can 
benefit by Senator BYRD’s efforts to advance 
clean coal technologies. Through 
this bill, we can fund renewables and 
ask our President to join worldwide 
with efforts to push renewables even 
more and to greater ends. And it is the 
same with all of those energies that 
have no effect, no impact on global 
warming. 

I can say, it may very well be, within 
a very short period of time, a nuclear 
powerplant will be developed. It will be 

a small little plant instead of a thousand 
megawatts. It might be 50 or 100 
megawatts. It will be a module. It will 
be self-contained. It will have no 
chance of having a meltdown. Just by 
the physical facts about its evolution 
and development it cannot, it will not. 
We might not have to touch it for 25 or 
30 years. 

Those are things we can work on as a 
criteria for development and growth 
and then set our great scientists in the 
private and public sector, with others 
in the world, to achieve this goal. What 
a great opportunity in the midst of a 
world that is frightened about whether 
we can grow, whether poor people can 
get rich, where the poor countries have 
to remain undeveloped because they 
cannot contribute to global warming. 
We will say we can all grow and prosper. 
America hasn’t stopped growing 
and prospering, but we can do it without 
affecting global warming if we just 
say let’s take a lead, let’s do this, let’s 
ask our greatest companies, our best 
laboratories, our greatest scientists, 
led by America, let’s put some money 
in each year in a consortium-type arrangement 
to get this done. 

If I sound like I am excited about 
something, obviously for some of you I 
have not even yet reached anything 
like an excited pitch, but in any event, 
I am because I believe it is a rare opportunity 
to take the genius of 
science—and I might say, I have a bias 
and prejudice but I think it will work. 
I think we have nuclear power for a 
reason. I don’t think we have developed 
nuclear power to throw it away. I believe 
we can develop another generation 
of nuclear power plants that can 
help this entire world prosper and put 
global warming behind us. 

Then we can ask, what is next? What 
have to be next are growth and opportunities, 
and not just for us. We say to 
the world, let’s be free. But, we don’t 
want people to think we are for them 
being free and poor. We are for them 
being free and affluent, to grow and 
have what we have. It cannot be done 
without better sources of clean energy. 

I believe this bill has things in it 
which, if put together by the President 
in a partnership arrangement, I think 
we could see real daylight and perhaps 
might be able to set some goals. 

My last comments will be very brief 
and have to do with national security. 
As I said when I started, what a peculiar 
bill, energy and water. Who would 
guess that sandwiched between those 
two words, energy and water, are the 

U.S. national security interests in nuclear 
weapons. 
We have a national policy, voted on 
this Senate floor on an amendment by 
the distinguished Senator Hatfield 
from Oregon. We don’t test our nuclear 
weapons underground nor do we test 
them at all. We don’t do that anymore. 
That used to be the easy way. I say 
that because today it looks easy. That 
is the way we used to determine reliability 
and safety. We don’t do that 
anymore. We don’t test underground. 

We have something to take its place. 
We have a whole body of science and 
computerization that we put together. 
It is now in the Department of Energy, 
and it has reached major nuclear laboratories. 
We fund a program called 
science-based stockpile stewardship. 
Stockpile is the nuclear weapons 
stockpile. We fund a part of the Department 
of Energy that is called the 
NNSA. My good friend, Senator REID, 
alluded to it when he spoke of creating 
this new institution within the Department. 
The current leader is four-star 
General Gordon. He’s doing a great job 
of pulling together and making sure 
there is one spokesman worried about 
the nuclear weapons aspects of the Department 
of Energy, reporting only to 
the Secretary. In a very real way he’s 
making sure we do a better job with 
what we spend on this stockpile. Nonetheless, 
we have to spend money on it. 
The biggest difference between our 
budget and the President’s budget is 
what to do with replenishing some of 
the physical facilities that are now old 
and broken down that are part of this 
NNSA. 

This bill says, let’s get started in 
multiyear repair and replenishing of 
some of the facilities that are nearly 50 
years old in which we ask the world’s 
greatest scientists to work to help 
keep this program and do this very difficult 
job. It will take many years to 
replenish these physical facilities, 
these laboratories. 

In addition, there are specific items 
such as major improvements in the 
funding of pit production. You simply 
must soon have the capability to 
produce plutonium pits for weapons, a 
capability we lost when Rocky Flats 
was closed in 1989. We had to put extra 
money in this bill, in order to keep 
that program on the calendar on which 
it is expected to be. We have put these 
funds in because we know they are 
needed. Add it all up and we have a 
very well rounded bill covering mundane 
things as well as the complex and 
difficult. 

In closing, let me say, that as part of 
this Department of Energy, we have developed 
some great research laboratories 
and not just those created and 
involved in nuclear work. There are 
many others that work on various aspects 
of research in America, most in 
the fields of energy, but not all, where 
some of the very best scientists in the 
world and some of the very best basic 
science research activities take place. 

In summary, we think we have a bill 
that takes care of, as well as possible, 
water resource needs of our country. It 
takes care of the basic energy needs we 
can promote through the Energy Department 
in moving ahead with another 
generation of nuclear reactors. 
And it encourages more progress on renewables. 
Through this bill and another 
dealing with cleaning up our coal 
so we can use it cleanly, we can have a 
prosperous future without having a 
negative impact on global warming and 
the future of our country and the 


S7678 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

world’s people. We think we have done 
that fairly well. 

We have spent more than the President 
asked. We hope we will be able to 
explain to the White House and OMB 
why and how that was done. We will 
have time after the bill is debated to do 
that. In the meantime, as the amendments 
come forward, perhaps the White 
House will have some suggestions. I 
hope they don’t ask us to change our 
vision. I think the vision in this bill is 
to move ahead with new sources of energy 
beyond Kyoto so we can say we 
are going to do it in a way that everyone 
will grow and prosper, so the poor 
can get rich in the world. 

I yield the floor. 

Mr. REID. We are on the energy and 
water bill. I know the Senator from Arizona 
wishes to speak. 

Mr. KYL. I want to take 30 seconds to 
compliment the Senator from New 
Mexico, and then I will ask unanimous 
consent to speak no more than 5 minutes 
in morning business. 

Mr. REID. My friend from Oregon 
also wishes to speak for 20 minutes in 
morning business. I ask that the Senator 
from Arizona be recognized to 
speak for up to 10 minutes in morning 
business and the Senator from Oregon 
be recognized for up to 20 minutes. 

Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right 
to object, Mr. President, what are you 
thinking in terms of the bill? 

Mr. REID. I will visit with you now. 

Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Arizona. 

Mr. KYL. I will not take the full 10 
minutes. 

I take 30 seconds to simply say, Senator 
DOMENICI each year has a significant 
responsibility, as well as the other 
Members of the subcommittee on 
which he sits, to put together a bill for 
energy and water. As he pointed out, a 
great deal of the jurisdiction of that 
subcommittee deals with our nuclear 
weapons program. Senator DOMENICI 
does not simply put together what he 
has been told is a good idea. He has 
taken a career to learn from these laboratories—
a couple of which he represents, 
and the people in those laboratories—
what is best in our national interests 
and what needs to done. It is 
not glorious work and there is no big 
political payoff. Very few people have 
the knowledge he does. He relies on 
people such as his staff, Clay Sell and 
Dr. Peter Lyons, a nuclear physicist 
from Los Alamos Laboratory, to assist 
him in developing the kind of plans 
that the Senate then needs to act upon, 
particularly with the comments about 
the development of nuclear energy that 
will be safe and that we need to promote 
for this country. 

I think he is absolutely right on the 
mark. I plan to join him in his efforts 
to promote that in the coming months. 

Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator 
yield? 

Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield. 

Mr. DOMENICI. I should have mentioned 
in my remarks, one of the Sen


ators who has helped me in the many 
months that we engaged in trying to 
make the Department of Energy more 
focused with reference to our nuclear 
weapons problems was the distinguished 
Senator from Arizona. I thank 
him for that help. We are not over that 
hurdle yet. Indeed, General Gordon and 
that semiautonomous agency have not 
been totally formulated. They are not 
grown up yet and are still walking 
along, maybe comparing it to high 
school and the eighth grade. They still 
have to get the diploma. This bill 
should enhance it or give them some of 
the tools they claim they need. 

In the meantime, I thank the Senator 
for observations and comments regarding 
a world beyond Kyoto. Clearly, 
if we do this right, we can have an 
abundance of energy and there need be 
no atmospheric pollution; we can do it 
another way. Clearly, we can get it 
done. 

I thank the Senator for his observation. 


Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield? 

Mr. KYL. I yield. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. 
CLINTON). The Senator from Nevada. 

Mr. REID. The Senator from Arizona 
missed my brief statement today about 
how I had become a late believer in the 
work that he and Senator DOMENICI had 
done on the National Nuclear Security 
Administration. As you may recall, 
last year I fought that initially. As I 
said to Senator DOMENICI, I thought it 
was being done, initially, for reasons 
other than what it turned out to be. I 
commend the Senator from Arizona—I 
have already done that to Senator 
DOMENICI—for the great work being 
done by General Gordon and the people 
working with him. It certainly has 
been a step in the right direction. 

With the deep concern I have with 
the nuclear arsenal, I think there is 
not anything we could be more devoted 
to than making sure General Gordon 
has enough money and general resources 
to do what he has to do which 
is so important. 

f 


ECONOMIC GROWTH 
Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we 
have seen for the past year a reduction 
in the growth rate of our economy. The 
world is experiencing a global economic 
slowdown. The tax cut signed 
into law in June contained compromises 
to make the tax cuts in the 
lowest bracket retroactive to January 

1. We are also going to begin to see the 
tax reduction checks in the American 
people’s hands by the end of this 
month. Perhaps there has never been a 
better-timed tax cut. The dollars we 
are returning to the taxpayers and the 
rate cuts that will allow them to keep 
a little more of their own hard earned 
salaries will provide some stimulus to 
keep the economy from falling further 
behind. 
I reject the advice of those who say 
that now is the time for the government 
to retreat and try and take more 

money out of the American workers’ 
pay envelopes. Nothing could be worse 
for a weakening economy. In fact, I believe 
that now is the time to find more 
ways to encourage economic growth. 
The tax cut provides some immediate 
stimulus and in the long-term some 
ways to keep the economy growing. 
But we need to look at ways to kick-
start the supply side of the economy. 
One possibility is to cut the capital 
gains tax rates. I will be pursuing this 
effort in the coming weeks and months. 
Nothing is more important than to get 
our economy moving again at full 
speed. 

My friend Jack Kemp authored a 
most interesting and compelling article 
a couple of weeks ago in the Wall 
Street Journal. Thirty years ago when 
I came to Congress I first met Jack. He 
was then and continues to be a person 
who is not afraid to challenge the common 
norms of economic thought. In the 
70’s Jack led the charge for tax rate 
cuts to get the economy moving. We 
have too easily forgotten the hopelessness 
that many Americans felt in the 
late 1970’s facing stagflation with no 
idea of how to turn the flagging U.S. 
economy around. Now we face a problem 
of a global slowdown. Jack suggests 
an answer. Many will try and dismiss 
his proposal. This is a debate that 
needs to continue. 

We need to get the American economy 
running at full speed. The tax bill 
was the first step. Getting the economy 
back to full growth will be my primary 
focus. 

I ask unanimous consent that the article 
by Mr. Kemp be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the

OUR ECONOMY NEEDS A GOLDEN ANCHOR 

(By Jack Kemp) 

How many more dashed hopes and false recoveries 
must we experience before politicians 
and monetary authorities accept the 
fact that our inability to manage fiat currencies 
is causing the global economic slowdown? 
They keep waiting for interest-rate 
reductions to kick in, yet more than six 
months after the Fed began lowering rates 
the economy continues to weaken. Waiting 
for the recently enacted tax cuts to provide 
‘‘stimulus’’ will prove futile as well. The 
economy does not suffer a lack of consumer 
demand, and more money in people’s pockets 
will not revive the supply side of the economy. 


UNPRECEDENTED EXPERIMENT 

Ronald Reagan once said he knew of no 
great nation in history that went off the 
gold standard and remained great. Since 
Aug. 15, 1971, when the U.S. ceased to redeem 
dollars held by foreign governments for gold, 
we have put that thesis to the test. For the 
first time in human history, not a single 
major currency in the world was linked to a 
commodity. Economist Milton Friedman 
called the situation ‘‘unprecedented’’ and 
said it is ‘‘not a long-term viable alternative.’’ 
‘‘The world,’’ he said, ‘‘needs a longterm 
anchor of some kind.’’ 

In the short term, at least, he was vindicated. 
In creating a world monetary system 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7679 

of floating fiat currencies with the stroke of 
a pen, President Nixon touched off a worldwide 
inflation that lasted through the ’70s 
and early ’80s. 

Yet America recovered to preside over the 
demise of world communism, and overcame 
the rising inflation and unemployment of 
‘‘stagflation’’ to enjoy an unparalleled 18year 
economic expansion. Today, the U.S. is 
at the pinnacle of its power and enjoying its 
greatest prosperity ever. 

Were Messrs. Reagan and Friedman wrong? 
I don’t think so. If the U.S. has so far come 
out on top in this experiment, it is only because 
other countries’ economies have suffered 
even more from floating currencies. 

Once the U.S. government ceased redeeming 
gold at $35 an ounce, its price quadrupled 
on world markets to $140 to reflect the dollar’s 
diminished value. By breaking the gold 
link, the Nixon economic team forced the 
unwanted liquidity pouring out of the Fed— 
which had thus far built up in the Eurodollar 
market and the portfolios of foreign central 
banks—to remain inside the U.S. economy 
where it would manifest itself in price inflation. 
Robert Mundell was the first to predict, 
in January 1972, there would soon be a dramatic 
rise in the price of oil, with general inflation 
to follow. 

Where the rest of the economics profession 
blamed the Arab oil-producing states for 
quadrupling the oil price in 1973, Mr. Mundell 
and those supply-siders who followed his intellectual 
lead knew that gold’s quadrupling 
had led the way. Tax rates rose through 
‘‘bracket creep,’’ capital formation stopped 
in its tracks, and it soon took two workers 
to produce the same income that one had 
brought home before the experiment. The 
stagflation that had its roots in leaving the 
gold standard was compounded when Congress 
and three different presidents tried to 
fight it with wage and price controls and 
high marginal tax rates. 

But discretionary monetary policy is 
Janus-faced, and instead of too much liquidity 
in the world economy we now have too 
little. Deflation began in 1996 when the Fed 
tightened monetary policy to combat some 
inflation it had created attempting to offset 
the economic drag of the Clinton tax hikes. 
A rising dollar then caused the dollar pegs of 
emerging economies to snap, set off the 
Asian, Brazilian and Russian economic meltdowns, 
and caused the price of oil and other 
commodities to collapse. Oil producers took 
a two-year holiday from drilling, which in 
turn created an oil shortage and drove energy 
prices sky high. 

Now, the energy-price hikes are working 
their way through the economy and are misconstrued 
by the Fed as inflation. Once 
again, central bank errors in the discretionary 
management of floating fiat currencies 
have put the entire world economy at 
risk. 

The Fed has cut interest rates 275 basis 
points since the start of the year, but the 
price of gold is still down to about $272 from 
$385 in 1996, having fallen $5 yesterday alone 
on the Fed’s announcement that it was lowering 
the fed funds rate another 25 basis 
points. Commodity prices are near their lowest 
levels in 15 years, and the foreign-exchange 
value of the dollar has risen against 
all major currencies since the Fed began its 
interest rate-easing cycle. 

Without a gold standard, the Fed has no 
means of determining how much liquidity 
markets demand, and all it does by targeting 
interest rates is guess how much liquidity to 
inject or withdraw to counteract mistakes it 
made earlier. The Fed may be on its way to 
mimicking the mistakes the Bank of Japan 
made when it lowered interest rates to zero, 
all the while prolonging and deepening Japan’s 
monetary deflation. 

This is no way to manage a currency. It’s 
obvious that we have accumulated a long series 
of small deflationary errors by the Fed 
that are dragging down the U.S. economy 
and helping depress world commerce. It’s 
time to restore a golden anchor to the dollar 
before our luck runs out and we suffer a real 
economic calamity. 

The Fed may yet get lucky with its rate 
cuts, although the Bank of Japan never did. 
The only certain way to end this deflation is 
to have the Fed stop targeting interest rates 
and begin targeting gold directly—not by 
‘‘fixing’’ the price of gold by administrative 
fiat as some people mistakenly characterize 
it, but rather by calibrating the level of liquidity 
in the economy, over which the Fed 
has exclusive and precise control, to keep 
the market price of gold stable within a narrow 
band closer to $325 than $275. 

There is nothing mysterious about how 
gold could be used as a reference point or 
how a new monetary standard for a new millennium 
would work. It would simply mean 
the Fed would stop guessing how much liquidity 
is good for the economy and allow 
the market to make that decision for it. 
With the dollar defined in terms of gold and 
with American citizens free to buy and sell 
gold at will, the Fed would forget about raising 
or lowering interest rates and simply add 
liquidity (buy bonds) when the price of gold 
tries to fall and subtract liquidity (sell 
bonds) when it tries to rise. Markets would 
determine interest rates. 

The paper dollar would once again be as 
good as gold—no more, no less. There would 
be no need for the U.S. government to maintain 
a large stock of gold or to redeem gold 
and dollars on demand since people would be 
free to do so on their own in the marketplace. 
As long as the Fed calibrated its infusions 
and withdrawals of liquidity by the 
market price of gold, the world would be free 
of monetary inflations and deflations caused 
by the whims and errors of central bank governors, 
as was the case for more than 200 
years when the private Bank of England 
managed the pound sterling in exactly that 
way. 

NOTHING SIMPLER 

The good news is that this could all be 
done easily, if President Bush and Treasury 
Secretary Paul O’Neill could work out an accord 
with Alan Greenspan. That accomplished, 
I believe Britain would soon follow 
to make the pound as good as gold and avoid 
having to adopt a sinking euro. 

There is nothing simpler than a gold standard, 
as Alexander Hamilton pointed out 
when he persuaded the first Congress to 
adopt one. Just as President Nixon took us 
off with an executive order, President Bush 
can put us back on with the stroke of a pen. 
It would be politically popular, as ordinary 
people benefit most. At Camp David in 1971, 
as President Nixon signed the papers, he is 
reported to have said: ‘‘I don’t know why I’m 
doing this. William Jennings Bryan ran 
against gold three times and he lost three 
times.’’

NAZI WAR CRIMINALS 
RESOLUTION 

Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, last 
week I introduced a resolution that addresses 
the United States’ use of Nazi 
war criminals after World War II. The 
resolution acknowledges the role of the 
United States in harboring Nazi fugitives, 
commends the Nazi War Criminal 
Interagency Working Group for 
serving the public interest by disclosing 
information about the Nazis, 

and calls on other governments to release 
information pertaining to the assistance 
these governments provided to 
Nazis in the postwar period. 

On July 14, 1934, the Reichstag declared 
the Nazi Party the only legitimate 
political party in Germany. In 
one fell swoop, political dissent in Germany 
was quashed and a tragic series 
of events was set into motion—a series 
of events that led to the genocide of six 
million Jews and five million Gypsies, 
Poles, Jehovah’s Witnesses, political 
dissidents, physically and mentally disabled 
people, and homosexuals. After 
World War II, the international community 
attempted to come to terms 
with what, by any measure, was a horrific 
episode in world history. 

In October 1945, a tribunal was convened 
in Nuremberg, Germany, to 
exact justice against the most nefarious 
Nazi War Criminals, people who 
knowingly and methodically orchestrated 
the murder of countless innocent 
people. Some infamous Nazi war 
criminals were tried and convicted 
elsewhere, including the infamous Adolph 
Eichmann, who was found guilty 
by an Israeli court. Still, many of the 
perpetrators—war criminals who heeded 
the call of the Nazi juggernaut—escaped 
justice. Some of those who 
evaded capture did so with the help of 
various world governments, including 
the United States. 

It is natural to ask why the United 
States would help known Nazi war 
criminals avoid punishment. The 
United States had just spent four years 
fighting the Nazis at the cost of thousands 
of young, courageous American 
soldiers. We had just liberated the Nazi 
death camps, witnessing firsthand the 
carnage and degradation exacted by 
the Nazis on Jews and others. Despite 
it all, the United States felt compelled 
to hide the very Nazis they had defeated 
and grant them refuge in the 
United States and abroad. 

The sad fact is that although we had 
just finished fighting a war of enormous 
proportions, we were entering another 
war—a cold war that would last 
for some 50 years. In fighting this war, 
the United States enlisted Nazi fugitives 
to spy on the Soviet Union. 

The extent to which the United 
States used Nazi war criminals for intelligence 
purposes in the postwar 
years is still being studied. In January 
1999, the President charged the Nazi 
War Criminal Records Interagency 
Working Group with the difficult task 
of locating, identifying, cataloguing, 
and recommending for declassification 
thousands of formerly classified documents 
pertaining to the United States’ 
association with Nazi war criminals. In 
addition to an interim report completed 
October 1999, in late April 2001, 
the IWG announced the release of CIA 
name files referring to specific Nazi 
War Criminals. While there is still 
work to be done, one thing is clear 
from these documents: the United 
States knowingly utilized Nazi war 
criminals for intelligence purposes and, 


S7680 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

in some cases, helped them escape justice. 


The American people deserve a full 
accounting of the decisions that led to 
the acceptance of Nazi war criminals as 
employees of the United States government. 
It also is important that the 
United States work with other countries 
to expedite the release of information 
regarding the use of Nazi war 
criminals as intelligence operatives. 
We need to learn more about the Holocaust 
and its aftermath. The international 
community must learn the 
lessons of history, so that never again 
will we face this type of evil.

BIOGRAPHICAL SUMMARY 

Curator of Twentieth-Century Art. For a decade 
between 1972 and 1982, Miss 
d’Harnoncourt served as Curator of 20th Century 
Art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. 
A specialist in the art of Marcel Duchamp, 
she co-organized a major retrospective exhibition 
in 1973–74, which originated in Philadelphia 
and traveled to The Museum of Modern 
Art, New York and The Art Institute of 
Chicago. Other exhibitions organized or co-
organized by Miss d’Harnoncourt include Futurism 
and the International Avant-Garde 
(1980), Violet Oaklev (1979), Eight Artists 
(1978) and John Cage: Score & Prints (1982). 
During her tenure as curator, she reinstalled 
the permanent galleries in the wing of the 
Museum devoted to 20th-century art, creating 
rooms specifically dedicated to the 
work of Duchamp and the sculpture of 
Brancusi. During her curatorship the Museum 
made the commitment to building a 
substantial contemporary collection, acquiring 
works by Ellsworth Kelly, Dan Flavin, 
Brice Marden, Agnes Martin, Claes 
Oldenburg, Katherine Anne Porter, Dorothea 
Rockburne, James Rosenquist, and Frank 
Stella, among others. 

Director: Projects undertaken by the Museum 
during Miss d’Harnoncourt’s directorship 
to date include a sequence of major exhibitions 
originated by Museum curators, 
such as: Sir Edwin Landseer (1982), The 
Pennsylvania Germans: A Celebration of 
Their Arts (1983), Masters of 17th-Century 
Dutch Genre Painting (1984), Federal Philadelphia 
(1987), Anselm Kiefer (1988), Workers: 
The Photographs of Sebastiano Salgado 
(1993), Japanese Design (1994) major 
retrospectives of Brancusi (1995) and Ce´zanne 
(1996), The Splendor of 18th-Century Rome 
(2000), Hon’ami Ko˜o˜etsu (2000) and Van Gogh: 
Face to Face (2000). She encouraged a series 
of scholarly publications devoted to the permanent 
collections: British Paintings (1986), 
Oriental Carpets (1988), Northern European 
Paintings (1990), Paintings from Europe and 
the Americas: A Concise Catalogue (1994), a 
new Handbook (1995), and a Handbook to the 
Museum’s textile collections (1998). 

Between 1992 and 1995, in a massive building 
project undertaken to reinstall all of the 
Museum’s European collections, over 90 galleries 
were renovated and relit, while thousands 
of works of art were examined, conserved 
and placed in fresh contexts. During 
her tenure as director, appointments to the 
professional staff include senior curators of 
Prints, Drawings and Photographs and European 
Decorative Arts, curators of Indian Art, 
Prints and Twentieth-Century Art, as well as 
a Senior Curator of Education, a new Librarian 
and conservators in the fields of decorative 
arts, furniture, painting and works on 
paper. Most recently, following her assumption 
of additional responsibilities in 1997 
upon the retirement of Robert Montgomery 
Scott as President of the Museum, Miss 
d’Harnoncourt and the newly appointed 
Chief Operating Officer led the institution 
through a long-range planning process with a 
view to celebrating the Museum’s 125th anniversary 
in the year 2001 with a number of 
new initiatives. 

In the year 2000, the Museum acquired a 
landmark building across the street and embarked 
upon a comprehensive masterplan for 
its use and the additional steps necessary to 

meet the Museum’s 25-year requirements for 
new or renovated space. Twenty galleries for 
modern and contemporary art were renovated 
and reopened in the fall of 2000. A 
capital campaign with a goal of $200 million 
was formally launched in December 2000, and 
$100 million was raised by March of 2001.

BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE TO 
PRESIDENT GERALD R. FORD 
Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, 
former Congressman, Vice President 

and President Gerald R. Ford turned 88 
on July 14. A birthday tribute to our 
38th President was written by White 
House correspondent Trude B. Feldman 
for the New York Times Syndicate; and 
it includes reflections by former Presidents 
Richard Nixon and Ronald 
Reagan, given to Ms. Feldman for Gerald 
Ford’s 80th birthday. I ask unanimous 
consent that the article be printed 
in the RECORD. 

President Ford was a healing force at 
a time of much greater political upheaval 
than we have today. The lessons 
to us today are that: disagreements 
should not become divisive; and political 
revenge is a vicious cycle without 
winners. 

Most important, as President Ford 
reiterates in this interview, is that 
‘‘truth is the glue that holds government 
together—not only our government, 
but civilization itself.’’ 

He tells Ms. Feldman, who has also 
written numerous articles on Mr. Ford 
and his family for McCall’s Magazine, 
that his main ambition was to become 
Speaker of the House of Representatives 
‘‘because the legislative process 
interested me and was the kind of challenge 
I enjoyed . . .’’ 

Gerald Ford concluded this interview—
which I recommend to my colleagues 
and our staff—with his beliefs 
that during his 29 months as President, 
he had steered the U.S. out of a period 
of turmoil, making it possible to move 
from despair to a renewed national 
unity of purpose and progress. ‘‘I also 
reestablished a working relationship 
between the White House and Congress, 
one that had been ruptured,’’ he notes. 
‘‘All that made an important difference. 
I consider that to be my greatest 
accomplishment as President.’’ 

There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 

[From the New York Times] 

GERALD R. FORD AT 88: A BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE 

(By Trude B. Feldman) 

On July 14, Gerald R. Ford will celebrate 
his 88th birthday. Having fully recovered 
from a stroke last August, the former president 
says he is now in excellent health— 
alert, active and keeping up with world affairs. 


Asked—in a birthday interview—how he 
feels about turning 88, he says: ‘‘Age doesn’t 
bother me. I’m not as mobile as I was 25 
years ago, but I feel fortunate to still have 
my zest for life. I have more enthusiasm now 
because of the care I take of myself. I follow 
a good diet, I don’t smoke or drink, and I 
keep busy.’’ 

In association with the American Enterprise 
Institute, one of Washington, D.C.’s 
leading think tanks, Mr. Ford established— 
in 1982—the AEI World Forum which he hosts 
annually in Beaver Creek, Colorado. 

The forum is a gathering of former and 
current international world leaders, business 
and financial executives and government officials 
who discuss political and economic 
issues. 

This year—in late June—the participants 
included Valery Giscard d’Estaing, former 
President of France; former Vice President 
and Premier of the Republic of China, Chan 
Lien; and Richard Cheney, Vice President of 
the United States, who was a former Chief of 

Staff to President Ford and Secretary of Defense 
in the first Bush administration. 

On May 21st, at the John F. Kennedy Library 
and Museum in Boston, Mass., Mr. 
Ford was the recipient of the John F. Kennedy 
Profile In Courage Award. Presented by 
the former President’s daughter, Caroline, 
and his brother, Senator Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.), the award cites President Ford’s 
courage in making the controversial decision 
of conscience to pardon former President 
Richard M. Nixon. 

Twenty seven years ago on August 9, 1974, 
Richard Nixon resigned the presidency of the 

U.S. and Vice President Ford became the 
38th president. A month later (September 8), 
President Ford granted a ‘‘full, free and absolute 
pardon’’ to Nixon ‘‘for all offenses 
against the U.S. which he . . . has committed 
or may have committed or taken part 
in’’ while he was president. 
Today, Mr. Ford concedes that he did not 
expect such a ‘‘hostile’’ reaction. ‘‘That was 
one of the greatest disappointments of my 
presidency,’’ he told me. ‘‘Everyone focused 
on the individual instead of on the problems 
the nation faced. I thought people would consider 
Richard Nixon’s resignation sufficient 
punishment, even shame. I expected more 
forgiveness.’’ 

In accepting the Profile In Courage Award, 
Mr. Ford told members of the Kennedy family 
and some 250 guests: ‘‘No doubt, arguments 
over the Nixon pardon will continue 
for as long as historians relive those tumultuous 
days. But I’d be less than human if I 
didn’t tell you how profoundly grateful I am 
for this recognition. The Award Committee 
has displayed its own brand of courage . . . 
But here, courage is contagious. 

‘‘To know John Kennedy, as I did, was to 
understand the true meaning of the word. He 
understood that courage is not something to 
be gauged in a poll or located in a focus 
group. No adviser can spin it. No historian 
can back date it. For, in the age old contest 
between popularity and principle, only those 
willing to lose for their convictions are deserving 
of posterity’s approval.’’ 

Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg said the 
award was inspired by her father’s Pulitzer 
Prize winning book, Profiles In Courage 
(first published in 1955 by Harper & Row) and 
was ‘‘instituted to celebrate his life and belief 
that political courage must be valued 
and honored. And that Gerald Ford had 
proved that politics can be a noble profession. 
. . .’’ 

Sen. Kennedy said President Ford had 
‘‘withstood the heat of controversy and persevered 
in his beliefs about what was in our 
country’s best interest. History has proved 
him right. 

‘‘At a time of national turmoil, our nation 
was fortunate that he was prepared to take 
over the helm of the storm-tossed ship of 
state. He recognized that the nation had to 
get on with its business and could not, if 
there was a continuing effort to prosecute 
former President Nixon. So President Ford 
made a tough decision and pardoned him. 

‘‘I was one of those who spoke out against 
his action. But time has a way of clarifying 
things, and now we see that President Ford 
was right.’’ 

General Alexander M. Haig Jr., Mr. Nixon’s 
White House Chief of Staff, concurs. ‘‘The 
passage of time has once again favored the 
truth and Gerald Ford has rightfully 
emerged as one of our nation’s most courageous 
leaders,’’ he told me in an interview, 
adding: 

‘‘Despite the risks, President Ford performed 
a singular and selfless act of courage. 
Almost 30 years have passed since ‘‘Watergate’’ 
and the scurrilous accusation that 
then Vice President Ford had made or considered 
a secret deal with President Nixon— 


S7682 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

through me—which traded the presidency of 
the U.S. for the pardon of Richard Nixon. 

Gen. Haig, also one of Ronald Reagan’s 
Secretaries of State, went on to say that the 
source of this accusation came from individuals 
who claimed to be acting in the best interests 
of President Ford, but, that, actually, 
it was well recognized at the time that 
the politics surrounding ‘‘Watergate’’ would 
lead to either the impeachment or the resignation 
of President Nixon. 

‘‘Those who fed the rumors of a deal were 
actually damaging the reputation, if not the 
judgment, of our nation’s first non-elected 
president,’’ General Haig recalls. ‘‘Having 
personally informed Vice President Ford of 
President Nixon’s intention to resign, I knew 
then, and now, that rumors of a deal were 
wrong-headed or worse. If believed, they 
would have the consequence of belittling 
what I have since referred to as a Cincinnatian 
act of moral courage by President 
Ford. 

‘‘Years later, the Nixon pardon must rank 
with the most courageous acts of a sitting 
president. President Ford, almost alone, notwithstanding 
the advice of some of his most 
intimate advisors, recognized that the nation 
could not risk further prolongation of 
the ‘Watergate’ controversy and that the 
very effectiveness of his presidency was at 
stake.’’ 

Jack Anderson, long-time columnist for 
United Features and Washington Editor of 
Parade Magazine, remembers Gerald Ford 
from his days in Congress. ‘‘He was never 
pumped up with self importance,’’ Mr. Anderson 
says. ‘‘Even after he became President, 
I was able to telephone him, leave a 
message, and he would return my calls, without 
a secretary.’’ 

Jack Anderson adds: ‘‘Even though I was 
number one on Richard Nixon’s ‘enemies 
list,’ I agreed with President Ford’s pardon 
of Mr. Nixon because I had learned that he 
was then in poor psychological condition. 
. . . It took great political courage to grant 
the pardon—against public will. So President 
Ford did what was best for Mr. Nixon and our 
country rather than what was best for himself. 
. . .’’ 

Cong. Henry A. Waxman, (D. Calif—29th 
district), ranking Democrat on the Governmental 
Reform and Oversight Committee 
and on the Energy and Commerce Committee, 
remembers that when he first came 
to Congress in Jan., 1975, Gerald Ford was 
President of the U.S. 

‘‘At the time, I was critical of his pardon 
of Richard Nixon,’’ Rep. Waxman told me. 
‘‘But, looking back now, President Ford took 
the right action for our country, and I believe 
history will show him as a president 
who helped bring the country together.’’ 

As a freshman Congressman, Gerald Ford 
was presented with the American Political 
Science Association’s Distinguished Public 
Service Award by Ambassador Max M. 
Kampelman, who today recalls Mr. Ford’s 
rise to the top—‘‘where he well served America 
at a time of crisis . . . and the ‘Profile In 
Courage’ Award is a late, but well-deserved 
recognition.’’ 

Ambassador Kampelman, currently at the 
Georgetown University Institute for Study 
of Diplomacy, was the head of the American 
delegation to the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (1980–3). 

During our interview at Washington, D.C.’s 
Willard Inter-Continental Hotel, Mr. Ford 
was in an expansive mood while reviewing 
his life’s journey. He evaluated his achievements 
and assessed the setbacks of his time 
in the Oval Office, and he reflected on the 
highs and lows of his 53 years in political 
life. 

What does Gerald Ford most regret as he 
looks back over a long and distinguished career? 


‘‘Well, I wish I were a better public speaker,’’ 
he allows. ‘‘I would have liked to be able 
to communicate more effectively. That is so 
very important.’’ 

He also regrets not having fulfilled his ambition 
of becoming Speaker of the House of 
Representatives. ‘‘I lost five times,’’ he laments. 
‘‘There were not, then, enough Republicans 
in the House. I wanted to be 
Speaker because the legislative process interested 
me, and was the kind of challenge I 
enjoyed. I was never as enthusiastic about 
being in the executive branch. I even turned 
down the chance to run for governor of 
Michigan.’’ 

In fact, he had made plans to retire from 
Congress in January, 1977. But in 1973, Vice 
President Spiro T. Agnew’s legal and campaign 
finance problems surfaced; and when 
he was forced to resign, Rep. Ford was selected 
as vice president. 

Two years ago at the White House, President 
William Jefferson Clinton presented 
Gerald Ford with the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom (America’s highest civilian award) 
for his legacy of healing and restored hope. 
‘‘From his days as a student and athlete, 
Gerald Ford was destined for leadership,’’ 
Mr. Clinton noted. ‘‘He was an outstanding 
player on the Michigan football team in a 
segregated era, and his horror at the discrimination 
to which one of his teammates 
was subjected, spawned in him a life-long 
commitment to equal rights for all people. 
He represents what is best in public service 
and what is best about America. 

‘‘. . .When steady, trustworthy Gerald 
Ford left the White House after 895 days, 
America was stronger, calmer, and more confident 
. . . more like President Ford himself.’’ 


Two months later, (October 1999) in a U.S. 
Capitol Rotunda ceremony, both Gerald Ford 
and his wife, Betty, were presented with the 
Congressional Gold Medal, Congress’s highest 
civilian honor. (He became the first 
former president to be so honored during his 
lifetime, and the event marked the first time 
a president and first lady were honored together.) 


Cong. Vernon J. Ehlers (R. Mich), who introduced 
the legislation to award the medals, 
said they are a token of appreciation 
from Congress for the former First Couple’s 
years of sacrifice and contributions . . . 
‘‘They are living examples of truly great 
Americans. . . .’’ 

Another speaker was President Clinton, 
who, after lauding Gerald Ford for his 
achievements, turned to him and revealed: 
‘‘When you made your healing decision, you 
made the Democrats and Liberals angry one 
day, and you made the Conservatives angry 
the next day. . . . I was then a young politician 
trying to get elected to Congress. It was 
easy for us to criticize you because we were 
caught up in the moment. You didn’t get 
caught up in the moment . . . and you were 
right . . . You were right about the controversial 
decisions you made to keep the 
country together and I thank you for that.’’ 

Donald H. Rumsfeld, U.S. Ambassador to 
NATO (1973) and one of Mr. Ford’s White 
House Chiefs of Staff and Defense Secretary 
(1975–1977), who is now again Secretary of Defense, 
told me that Gerald Ford’s basic 
human decency ‘‘helped to replenish the reservoir 
of trust for our country and I’m delighted 
that the enormous contributions he 
made are being recognized.’’ 

After a taste of the presidency, Mr. Ford 
still does not hide his disappointment at losing 
the 1976 election to Jimmy Carter. ‘‘As 
you well know,’’ Mr. Ford notes, ‘‘I tried 
very hard to win that election. That would 
have given me a chance to expand individual 
freedom from mass government, mass industry, 
mass labor, and mass education.’’ 

Despite that election, former Presidents 
Ford and Carter are close friends and cosponsors 
of various conferences on world affairs 
at the Carter Center in Atlanta. And, 
on the occasion of Gerald Ford’s 88th birthday, 
Jimmy Carter today reflects: 

‘‘The recent Profile In Courage Award and 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom are long 
overdue recognition of Gerald Ford’s importance 
to our nation. He was a strong leader 
during a time of great challenge, and his just 
and noble decisions may well have cost him 
the election. In the years since then, he and 
I have worked together on a number of 
issues. Each time we do so, I am reminded 
anew of our country’s good fortune to have 
been led by a man of such principled convictions. 
Not only do we share the special bonds 
of the presidency, but I am also proud to 
claim Gerald Ford as my friend.’’ 

Eight years ago, for my feature on Gerald 
Ford’s 80th birthday, another former president, 
Ronald Reagan, who narrowly lost the 
1976 presidential nomination to him, told me: 
‘‘First, I can tell Jerry that turning 80 
doesn’t hurt at all. Kidding aside, Jerry is an 
independent thinker and down to earth. He is 
not impressed with his own importance. 
That humility has stood him in good stead. 

‘‘He climbed to the top of his profession 
without wavering from his principles. When 
respect for government officials had begun 
to wane, he was, and still is, held in high regard.’’ 


For that same birthday tribute, former 
President Nixon told me that he had met 
Representative Ford in 1949 when he was 
sworn in to Congress. ‘‘I was then a representative 
from California, and for all these 
years, we remained good friends,’’ Mr. Nixon 
said. ‘‘In an illustrious career, he became an 
eminent statesman, and as my vice president, 
he was an asset. 

‘‘Because he understood members of Congress, 
he was able to encourage them, to appeal 
to their best qualities and to unite them 
for the common good. He was admired for his 
decency and his respect for each individual’s 
rights. And so this milestone gives me the 
chance to express my gratitude to Jerry 
Ford for all the good he has done for our nation 
. . .’’ 

When Gerald Ford became president, he 
was faced with an overwhelmingly Democratic 
Congress. He recalls that he ‘‘struggled 
repeatedly’’ over such issues as government 
spending, presidential war powers and 
oversight of the intelligence community. He 
also advocated reducing the size and role of 
the federal government through cuts in taxes 
and spending, paperwork reduction and government 
deregulation. 

In foreign affairs, he recalls, his administration 
emphasized stronger relationships 
with American allies, encouraged detente 
with the Soviet Union, and made progress in 
negotiating with the Soviets on nuclear 
weapons. With French President Valery Giscard 
d’Estaing, he initiated annual international 
economic summits of the major developed 
economic nations. In the face of bitter 
opposition, President Ford signed the 
Helsinki Final Act, for the first time giving 
the issue of human rights a real ‘‘bite’’ inside 
the Soviet bloc, which eventually led directly 
to Eastern Europe throwing off the 
shackles of communism. His administration 
initiated the second Sinai disengagement 
agreement, further separating Israeli and 
Egyptian forces and reducing tensions in the 
Middle East. It also directed the final withdrawal 
of Americans and refugees from Indochina 
at the end of the Vietnam War. 

President Ford recalls that the saddest day 
of his presidency was April 30, 1975, ‘‘when we 
had to pull our troops out of Saigon and 
withdraw from South Vietnam, which soon 
surrendered to the North Vietnamese.’’ 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7683 

Asked whether foreign affairs is more 
pressing today than during his White House 
tenure, he says, ‘‘I don’t think it is any more 
important than when we were faced daily 
with the nuclear challenge from another superpower—
the Soviet Union. Those were 
tense days. 

‘‘Yes, we have problems today in Europe, 
the Mideast and elsewhere. But they are no 
more serious than the Cold War days—with 
all the challenges that then existed.’’ 

Mr. Ford points out that President Nixon’s 
skillful maneuvering in the Mideast will go 
down in the annals of great diplomacy. ‘‘In 
foreign policy,’’ he says, ‘‘Richard Nixon is 
unequaled by any other American president 
in this century.’’ 

How was the presidency evolved since Gerald 
Ford left the White House 241/2 years ago? 
‘‘The office changes with each president,’’ he 
says. ‘‘Each occupant defines the role and his 
responsibilities. In my case, I tried to make 
a difference in my leadership.’’ 

He went on to say that he learned about 
leadership and making decisions while serving 
as an officer in the US Navy during 
World War II. ‘‘I think,’’ he adds, ‘‘I was a 
better vice president and president because 
of that military service.’’ 

He notes that there is ‘‘a majesty’’ to the 
presidency that inhibits even close friends 
and heads of state from telling the chief executive 
what is actually on their minds—especially 
in the Oval Office. 

‘‘You can ask for blunt truth, but the 
guarded response never varies,’’ he says. ‘‘To 
keep perspective, any president needs to hear 
straight talk. And he should, at times, come 
down from the pedestal the office provides. 

‘‘I’m still convinced that truth is the glue 
that holds government together—not only 
our government, but civilization itself.’’ 

From his experiences, he cautions future 
presidents about general abuse of power and 
the dangers of over-reliance on staff. 

At the outset of President Bill Clinton’s 
first term, there was criticism of his staff 
and operation of his White House. Mr. Ford 
then expressed sympathy for a president undergoing 
periods of anxiety and disarray, 
even turmoil. 

He noted that he, too, had problems with 
staff mismanagement. Today, he is still concerned 
about the image of the presidency, 
and still concerned that a solution has not 
been found about overzealous White House 
employees who are not instructed, from the 
outset, that they work for the president and 
for the people—and not the other way 
around. 

He maintains that staff assistants are not 
elected by the people, and that the president 
himself needs to determine how much trust 
to invest in his aides. ‘‘Otherwise,’’ he emphasizes, 
‘‘the ramifications and the consequences 
of their arrogance and abuse of 
power—particularly by secondary and lower 
staff—can be dangerous.’’ 

Mr. Ford concurs with one of President 
Lyndon B. Johnson’s press secretaries, 
George E. Reedy, who wrote in his book, 
‘‘The Twilight of the Presidency’’: ‘‘Presidents 
should not hire any assistants under 40 
years old who had not suffered any major 
disappointments in life. When young amateurs 
find themselves in the West Wing or 
East Wing of the White House, they begin to 
think they are little tin gods . . .’’ 

In his autobiography, ‘‘A Time to Heal,’’ 
Mr. Ford wrote: ‘‘Reedy had left the White 
House staff several years before, but he was 
predicting the climate that had led to ‘Watergate.’ 
And that is disturbing.’’ 

Born in 1913 in Omaha, Nebraska, to Dorothy 
Gardner and Leslie Lynch King Jr., Gerald 
Ford was christened Leslie L. King Jr. 
His parents divorced when he was two years 
old. He moved with his mother to Grand 
Rapids, Mich., where she married Gerald Rudolph 
Ford, who later adopted the child and 
gave him his name, Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. 

If he were able to relive his 88 years, what 
would he do differently? 

‘‘I would make no significant changes,’’ he 
says. ‘‘I’ve been lucky, both in my personal 
life and professionally. Along the way I tried 
to improve myself by learning something 
new in each of the jobs I held. I’ve witnessed 
more than my share of miracles . . . I’ve witnessed 
the defeat of Nazi tyranny and the destruction 
of hateful walls that once divided 
free men from those enslaved. 

‘‘. . . It has been a grand adventure and I 
have been blessed every step by a loving wife 
and supportive family.’’ 

He says he will never forget one of the family’s 
worst days in the White House . . . six 
weeks after they moved in, ‘‘Betty received a 
diagnosis of breast cancer,’’ he recalls. ‘‘But 
her courage in going public with her condition 
. . . and her candor about her mastectomy 
increased awareness of the need of examination 
for early detection, saving countless 
women’s lives.’’ 

Six years later (1980), former President and 
Mrs. Ford dedicated The Betty Ford Diagnostic 
and Comprehensive Breast Center, in 
Washington, D.C. (part of Columbia Hospital 
for Women). The Center’s former director, 
Dr. Katherine Alley, a renowned breast cancer 
surgeon, says today: ‘‘As one of the first 
women of note to go public with her cancer 
diagnosis and treatment, Betty Ford helped 
women to face the disease more openly and 
with less fear.’’ 

Turning to his philosophy of life, Mr. Ford 
says: ‘‘I’ve always been an optimist and still 
am. Yes, I suffered a few disappointments 
and defeats, but I tried to forget about those, 
and keep a positive attitude. When I was in 
sports and lost a game by error, or in the political 
arena, when I lost by a narrow margin, 
no amount of groaning would do any 
good. So I don’t dwell on the past. I learned 
to move on and look ahead.’’ 

Much as he had yearned to be elected president 
in his own right in 1976, Gerald Ford is 
confident that history will record that he 
‘‘healed America at a very difficult time.’’ 

He believes that his presidential leadership 
for 29 months had steered the U.S. out of 
that period of turmoil, making it possible to 
move from despair to a renewed national 
unity of purpose and progress. 

‘‘I also re-established a working relationship 
between the White House and Congress, 
one that had been ruptured,’’ he concludes. 
‘‘All that made an important difference. I 
consider that to be my greatest accomplishment 
as president, and I hope historians will 
record that as my legacy.’’

LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT 
OF 2001 

Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, 
I rise today to speak about hate 
crimes legislation I introduced with 
Senator KENNEDY in March of this 
year. The Local law Enforcement Act 
of 2001 would add new categories to 
current hate crimes legislation sending 
a signal that violence of any kind is 
unacceptable in our society. 

I would like to describe a terrible 
crime that occurred November 3, 1991 
in Houston, TX. Phillip W. Smith was 
shot to death outside a gay bar in 
Montrose. Johnny Bryant Darrington 
III, 20, was charged with murder and 
aggravated robbery. He told police he 
hated homosexuals. 

I believe that government’s first duty 
is to defend its citizens, to defend them 
against the harms that come out of 
hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement 
Act of 2001 is now a symbol 
that can become substance. I believe 

that by passing this legislation, we can 
change hearts and minds as well.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 

TRIBUTE TO JAMES A. TURNER 
S Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a dear friend, 
James A. Turner of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. 
Jim Turner was a man of great 
courage, intelligence and character. We 
were friends for more than 40 years. I 
believe America has lost a great patriot 
with the recent death of James A. 
Turner. 

Born in 1925, Jim grew up on a farm 
just outside of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. 
As World War II began, Jim left high 
school to serve his country. He enlisted 
in the Marine Corps and served with 
honor. Indeed, he earned and received 
the Purple Heart in 1945 on Iwo Jima 
when a machine gun blinded him during 
battle. 

Jim returned to Alabama and in spite 
of his blindness earned his undergraduate 
degree in 1949. He received his 
juris doctorate from the University of 
Alabama in 1952. Jim always credited 
his wife and classmate, Louise, for his 
success in school. Louise read Jim’s 
textbooks to him so he could keep up 
with his studies. 

Following graduation, Louise joined 
Jim at their law firm, Turner and 
Turner. Today, their son, Don, and 
their grandson, Brian, also work at 
Turner and Turner. The family law 
firm has spanned five decades and continues 
to thrive in Tuscaloosa. 

Together, Jim and Louise raised 
three wonderful sons, Don, Rick and 
Glenn, who have brought them great 
joy in life. Their grandchildren, Brian, 
Lindsay and Brittany; and great-granddaughter 
Farris, are sources of considerable 
pride. 

Jim was active in his community. He 
was an active member of the Tuscaloosa 
Bar Association and also served 


S7684 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

as President of the Tuscaloosa Bar Association. 
His family worshiped at 
United Methodist Church in Alberta. 

We have in recent years heard reference 
to ‘‘the Greatest Generation.’’ 
Many of us have friends and relatives 
who have served our country and 
earned the right to wear that mantle. 
However, I know of few men who lived 
every day of their lives with the valor, 
courage, and love of country with 
which Jim Turner lived his entire life. 

Our country has lost a good man and 
great lawyer, a devoted husband and 
father, a proud Marine and a loyal 
American. Words cannot express the 
respect I have for Jim Turner, nor can 
they express the sorrow my family and 
our community feels since this loss.S

TRIBUTE TO MORTIMER CAPLIN 

S Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor a man whose lifetime 
record of achievement and service is 
the embodiment of the best of America. 
My friend, Mortimer Caplin, has 
for 61/2 decades honorably served his 
Nation, his community, and our beloved 
University of Virginia, amassing 
an exemplary record of accomplishment 
of the highest order. I ask unanimous 
consent that the following remarks 
made by Robert E. Scott, Dean 
of the University of Virginia Law 
School, be printed in the RECORD. 
These remarks are part of a speech 
Dean Scott made during the presentation 
to Mr. Caplin of The Thomas 
Jefferson Foundation Medal in Law, 
the University of Virginia’s highest 
honor. 
REMARKS OF DEAN ROBERT E. SCOTT UPON 

THE PRESENTATION OF THE THOMAS JEFFER


SON FOUNDATION MEDAL IN LAW TO 

MORTIMER M. CAPLIN, APRIL 12, 2001 

MR. PRESIDENT, MR. RECTOR, AND DISTINGUISHED 
GUESTS: Today is the 10th, and last 
time I will stand in this glorious space and 
introduce a recipient of the Jefferson Medal 
in Law. None of the prior occasions have 
given me as much joy and pleasure as the 
duty I discharge today. It is my great honor 
to present Mortimer M. Caplin, the 2001 recipient 
of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation 
Medal in Law. Mortimer Caplin represents 
the very best of the University’s aspirations 
for its own. Some people gain distinction by 
happenstance, by being in the right place 
and the right time and then rising to the occasion. 
Mortimer Caplin’s reputation rests 
on a lifetime of achievement. Throughout 
the nearly seven decades that he has been associated 
with the University, he has exemplified 
a singular constancy of excellence. At 
every step of the way he has shown how talent, 
courage, persistence and a commitment 
to service can combine to inspire and transform 
us. These are exactly the qualities that 
Mr. Jefferson exemplified in his own life and 
wanted his University to embody. 

Mortimer Caplin was born in New York in 
1916. He came to Charlottesville in 1933, graduating 
from the college in 1937 and the Law 
School in 1940. As an undergraduate, he not 
only earned the highest academic honors but 
excelled at what the University then regarded 
as the most estimable athletic endeavor 
its students could undertake, intercollegiate 
boxing. At the Law School, he displayed 
the same pattern of remarkable success. 
He was elected editor-in-chief of the 

Law Review and went on to serve as law 
clerk for Judge Armistead Dobie, a former 
Dean of the Law School who by tradition 
chose the most outstanding graduate of each 
class as his assistant. 

Mort had barely begun his career as a New 
York lawyer when World War II broke out. 
In anticipation of the conflict, he already 
had enlisted in the Navy and took up his 
commission shortly after Pearl Harbor. 
Eager for active duty, he requested a transfer 
out of the stateside intelligence work 
that was his first assignment. The Navy responded 
by making him a beachmaster on 
Omaha Beach during the Normandy invasion. 
Facing enemy fire, Mort had to make 
hard choices quickly to ensure that supplies 
and reinforcements kept coming. When the 
occasion required it, he used creativity and 
imagination to cut through bureaucratic impediments 
to achieving his essential mission. 
Thus, when a ship’s captain refused to beach 
his vessel at a time when the ammunition it 
carried was in short supply along the front 
and no other method of delivering its cargo 
presented itself, Mort invented a two-star 
general whose imaginary order got the job 
done. 

Mort Caplin returned from the war to New 
York, but not many years later heard the 
University’s call and answered, joining the 
Law faculty in 1950. For over a decade he 
taught federal taxation and constitutional 
law. During this time he produced important 
scholarship and excelled in the classroom. 
Perhaps equally important was the leadership 
role Mortimer Caplin played at the University 
and in the Charlottesville community. 
In 1950 Mort led the Law faculty in its 
unanimous decision to admit Gregory Swanson 
to the Law School, the first African-
American to enroll at the University. Subsequently, 
Mort was a central figure in organizing 
the efforts of the Charlottesville community 
to circumvent the ‘‘massive resistance’’ 
campaign that Virginia’s political 
leaders had launched at the Supreme Court’s 
desegregation mandate. Mort, along with 
other law faculty and their spouses worked 
unceasingly to ensure that neither children 
nor civil rights suffered during this dark 
time in Virginia’s history. 

A brilliant and popular professor, Mort 
Caplin dazzled his students. One who was especially 
impressed was Robert F. Kennedy, 
the younger brother of a rising star in the 
Democratic Party. Several years later, after 
that rising star had become the President of 
the United States, John F. Kennedy appointed 
his brother’s former tax professor as 
United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 
Mort accepted this challenge with his 
characteristic energy and good judgment. He 
led that critically important if sometimes 
unpopular agency for three years, at a time 
of significant changes in the United States 
economy and the tax system. At the end of 
his term, the Treasury Department granted 
him the Alexander Hamilton award, the 
highest possible honor that institution can 
bestow. 

Having traveled to Washington, Mort chose 
to stay. He recognized the need for a first-
rate law firm specializing in tax practice 
and, with Douglas Drysdale, another Virginia 
alumnus, founded Caplin & Drysdale. 

Shortly after establishing his law firm, 
Mort resumed his teaching at the Law 
School. For more than twenty years he 
taught advanced courses emphasizing the 
interplay of tax law and practice. For many 
students at Virginia, tax law with Mortimer 
Caplin became a springboard for a career 
both as public servants and as practitioners 
in the nation’s elite law firms. Mort consistently 
emphasized the importance of a lawyer’s 
independence and judgment, and 
preached the central obligation of advancing 

the public interest while serving one’s clients. 
He sought to lead his students to a life 
in law that would ennoble and dignify the 
person living it. 

During this time of building a prestigious 
law firm and extending a teaching career, 
Mort Caplin still found time for significant 
service to the bar and the general public. He 
served as President of the Indigent Civil 
Litigation Fund and on the executive committee 
of the Washington Lawyers Committee 
for Civil Rights under Law, on numerous 
significant committees of the American 
Bar Association, and various charitable 
organizations. His service as a trustee of the 
Law School foundation in particular provided 
great vision and support during a period 
of change and growth. In recognition of 
this service, Mort collected a remarkable 
number of awards and distinctions, honorary 
degrees and other testimonials to his generosity 
and accomplishments. 

In 1988, at the age of 72, Mort Caplin became 
a Professor Emeritus of the University. 
This simply opened a new phase in his astonishing 
career of service and dedication to 
this University and to the profession. Still to 
come was a five-year term on the University’s 
Board of Visitors and exemplary service 
to the Law School as chair of the executive 
committee of our recently concluded 
capital campaign. When we began the Law 
School campaign in July 1992, the first person 
I went to see was Mortimer Caplin. When 
I asked whether he would lead what would 
become an eight-year fundraising effort. 
Mort replied simply, ‘‘I’ll do it.’’ True to his 
word, he did. By dint of his example and 
leadership, the Law School recently concluded 
the most successful campaign in the 
history of American legal education. 

Mort Caplin remains to this day a central 
figure in the governance of the Law School 
and its guidance into the twenty-first century. 
He has been a driving force behind the 
Law School’s commitment to a broad public 
vision, as reflected in our decision to dedicate 
our Public Service Center in his honor. 
He, in turn, has honored, elevated, and enriched 
us along every possible dimension. 

Mr. President, Mortimer Caplin comes to 
us today as the embodiment of what Mr. Jefferson 
envisioned as the best that we Americans 
have within us. He has lived a life in 
law as a high calling, one dedicated to advancement 
of knowledge, service to the nation, 
husbanding the great resources with 
which we have been endowed and ensuring 
that all Americans can take part in our 
great national banquet and enjoy the opportunities 
that life in America presents. On behalf 
of the School of Law and the selection 
committee, it is my privilege to introduce 
Mortimer M. Caplin as the 2001 recipient of 
the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in 
Law.S

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 

BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS, 

THURSDAY, JULY 12, 2001 

By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself 
and Mr. CARPER): 

S. 1176. A bill to strengthen research 
conducted by the Environmental Protection 
Agency, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Environment and 
Public Works. 
Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce legislation with 
my friend and colleague, Senator CARPER, 
which will strengthen the use of 
science at the Environmental Protection 
Agency. By improving science at 
the Agency, we will be improving the 
framework of our regulatory decisions. 
It is important that these regulations 
be effective, not onerous and inefficient. 
To make government regulations 
efficient, they must be based on a solid 
foundation of scientific understanding 
and data. 

Last year, the National Research 
Council released a report, ‘‘Strengthening 
Science at the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency: Research 
Management and Peer Review Practices’’ 
which outlined current practices 
at the EPA and made recommendations 
for improving science within the agency. 
The bill we are introducing today, 
the ‘‘Environmental Research En


hancement Act,’’ builds on the NRC report. 


When the Environmental Protection 
Agency was created in 1970 by President 
Nixon, its mission was set to protect 
human health and safeguard the 
environment. In the 1960s, it had become 
increasingly clear that ‘‘we needed 
to know more about the total environment—
land, water, and air.’’ The 
EPA was part of President Nixon’s re-
organizational efforts to effectively ensure 
the protection, development and 
enhancement of the total environment. 

For the EPA to reach this mission, 
establishing rules and priorities for 
clean land, air and water require a fundamental 
understanding of the science 
behind the real and potential threats 
to public health and the environment. 
Unfortunately, many institutions, citizens 
and groups believe that science 
has not always played a significant 
role in the decision-making process at 
the EPA. 

In NRC’s report last year, it was concluded 
that, while the use of sound 
science is one of the Environmental 
Protection Agency’s goals, the EPA 
needs to change its current structure 
to allow science to play a more significant 
role in decisions made by the Administrator. 


The legislation we are introducing 
today looks to address those shortcomings 
at the EPA by implementing 
portions of the report that require congressional 
authorization. 

Under our bill, a new position, Deputy 
Administrator for Science and 
Technology will be established at the 
EPA. This individual will oversee the 
Office of Research and Development; 
the Environmental Information Agency; 
the Science Advisory board; the 
Science Policy Council; and the scientific 
and technical activities in the 
regulatory program at the EPA. This 
new position is equal in rank to the 
current Deputy Administrator and 
would report directly to the Administrator. 
The new Deputy would be responsible 
for coordinating scientific research 
and application between the scientific 
and regulatory arms of the 
Agency. This will ensure that sound 
science is the basis for regulatory decisions. 
The new Deputy’s focus on 
science could also change how environmental 
decisions are made. 

Additionally, the Assistant Administrator 
for Research and Development, 
currently the top science job at the 
EPA, will be appointed for 6 years 
versus the current 4 years political appointment. 
Historically, this position 
is recognized to be one of the EPA’s 
weakest and most transient administrative 
positions according to NRC’s 
report, even though in my view, the position 
addresses some of the Agency’s 
more important topics. By lengthening 
the term of this Assistant Administrator 
position and removing it from 
the realm of politics, I believe there 
will be more continuity in the scientific 
work of the Agency across administrations 
and allow the Assistant 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7689 

Administrator to focus on science conducted 
at the Agency. 

In 1997, we learned the problems that 
can arise when sound science is not 
used in making regulatory decisions. 
Following EPA’s ozone and particulate 
matter regulations there was great uncertainty 
on the scientific side. 

When initially releasing the Ozone/ 
PM regulations, the EPA greatly over 
estimated the impacts for both ozone 
and PM, and they had to publicly 
change their figures later on. Additionally, 
they selectively applied some 
study results while ignoring others in 
their calculations. For example, the 
majority of the health benefits for 
ozone are based on one PM study by a 
Dr. Moogarkar, even though the Agency 
ignored the PM results of that study 
because it contradicted their position 
on PM. 

The legislation that Senator CARPER 
and I are introducing will ensure that 
science no longer takes a ‘‘back seat’’ 
at the Environmental Protection Agency 
in terms of policy making. I call on 
my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring 
this bill, and I urge speedy consideration 
of this bill. I ask unanimous 
consent that the text of the bill be 
printed in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 1176 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 

By Mr. LUGAR (for himself and 
Mr. BAYH): 

S. 1181. A bill to designate the facility 
of the United States Postal Service 
located at 2719 South Webster Street in 
Kokomo, Indiana, as the ‘‘Elwood 
Haynes ‘‘Bud’’ Hillis Post Office Building’’; 
to the Committee on Governmental 
Affairs. 
Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I 
would like to take this opportunity to 
pay tribute to a distinguished Hoosier 
and tireless public servant, former Congressman 
Bud Hillis. 

My colleague, Mr. BAYH, and I are introducing 
legislation to honor Congressman 
Hillis by naming the Post Office 
in Kokomo, Indiana the Elwood 
Haynes ‘‘Bud’’ Hillis Post Office. 

Congressman Hillis honorably served 
the people of Indiana’s 5th District in 
the House of Representatives from 1971 
to 1986. Congressman Hillis was a fair 
and reasonable voice on national security, 
trade, and veterans’ issues. A 
graduate of Indiana’s Culver Military 
Academy, he enlisted in the Army at 
the age of 18 and fought in the World 
War II European Theater as an infantryman 
for 27 months. After leaving active 
duty as a first lieutenant, Bud Hillis 
attended Indiana University and the 
Indiana University School of Law. He 
went on to practice law in Howard 
County, Indiana, and served as Chairman 
of the county bar association. 

Before being elected to Congress in 
1970, Congressman Hillis served two 
terms in the Indiana House of Representatives. 


The 1970s and early 1980’s were difficult 
times for many in Indiana’s 5th 
District. A downturn in the auto industry 
during the recession brought unemployment 
in some of the district’s more 
highly industrialized communities to 
over 15 percent. He founded the Congressional 
Auto Task Force and he 
helped to round up votes in 1979 to pass 
legislation that I had sponsored here in 
the Senate to guarantee loans to the 
struggling Chrysler Corporation, an 
employer of more than 60,000 Hoosiers 
at the time. In 1983, he worked to pro


tect the auto industry from Japanese 
imports by extending a voluntary restraint 
agreement. He was a strong 
force on the Congressional Steel Caucus 
and served as Vice President of the 
executive committee. 

As a member of the Armed Services 
Committee, Congressman Hillis was a 
dependable ally of the Reagan military 
build-up that helped to bring an end to 
the Cold War. He supported American 
service men by backing enlistment bonuses 
for military personnel and was a 
proponent of reinstating draft registration, 
which had ended with the Vietnam 
War. Further, he was instrumental 
in development and deployment 
of the M–1 tank and the preservation of 
Grissom Air Force Reserve Base in 
Peru, Indiana. 

Congressman Hillis also took a personal 
interest with the veterans of our 
Nation. As a member of the Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee, he was a leader in 
improving health care for veterans and 
was instrumental in the construction 
of the community-based outpatient 
clinic in Crown Point, IN. 

Congressman Bud Hillis has a distinguished 
record of service to his country 
and to the people of Indiana. The dedication 
of the post office in Kokomo, Indiana, 
a city that continues to be involved 
deeply with the American auto 
industry that Congressman Hillis supported 
so strongly, would be a fitting 
tribute for such an honorable statesman. 


I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of the bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 1181 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF ELWOOD HAYNES 

‘‘BUD’’ HILLIS POST OFFICE BUILD


ING. 

(a) IN GENERAL.—The facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 2719 South 
Webster Street in Kokomo, Indiana, shall be 
known and designated as the ‘‘Elwood 
Haynes ‘Bud’ Hillis Post Office Building’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the facility referred 
to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to 
be a reference to the Elwood Haynes ‘‘Bud’’ 
Hillis Post Office Building. 
By Mr. HOLLINGS: 

S. 1182. A bill to direct the Secretary 
of the Army to lease land at the Richard 
B. Russell Dam and Lake Project, 
South Carolina, to the South Carolina 
Department of Commerce, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works. 
Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I 
rise today to introduce legislation that 
will provide economic stimulation to 
one of the poorest counties in South 
Carolina. This legislation will allow 
the South Carolina Department of 
Commerce, SCDOC, to proceed with a 
project that began almost a decade 
ago. Well, actually the project began 

long before that, way back when the 
Army Corps of Engineers built Lake 
Richard B. Russell in 1984. 

Lake Russell is a 26,000-acre freshwater 
lake on the South Carolina-Georgia 
border and was very controversial 
when originally proposed by the Army 
Corps of Engineers. Enhancement of 
economic development in the region 
was a main selling point of the Corps 
to overcome State, local and environmental 
objections to the lake. Yet, to 
date, virtually no development has occurred 
despite efforts from South Carolina’s 
Department of Commerce. 
Today, there is not a single room for 
rent by the public within sight of, or 
within reasonable walking distance of, 
the lake. There is only one gas pump 
on the entire lake and that is at a 
State park. 

Following the completion of Lake 
Russell in 1984, the Department of 
Commerce and Abbeville County began 
a plan for the development of a lake-
front golf and vacation resort. The Department 
contracted with a development 
company in 1997 to develop the 
project, but in 1998, due to financial 
difficulties, construction was suspended 
and the developer defaulted on 
its Development Agreement with 
SCDOC. As a result of this default, the 
Commerce Department terminated the 
agreement and the property was returned 
to the State. 

In January 1999, in an attempt to 
complete this project, SCDOC solicited 
proposals from various qualified developers. 
After consideration of several 
proposals, a developer was selected 
that had a history of successful developments 
throughout the State of South 
Carolina. However, in order for the 
project to be successful, changes to the 
current lease have to be made. These 
changes are reflected by the proposed 
legislation. 

When drafting this legislation, I 
wanted to address several points that 
may cause concern. First, I wanted to 
make sure the public had an opportunity 
to be involved throughout the 
process. Second, I wanted to make sure 
any additional land that was included 
in the project would be mitigated by 
providing lands with similar ecological 
values and habitat. And third, I wanted 
to ensure that this project would be 
economically viable. I believe the legislation 
does this. 

Like I said, the legislation is simple 
and will bring economic development 
to a county that has longed for it. By 
completing this project, Abbeville 
County will be able to take advantage 
of the economic stimulation created by 
vacationers and tourism from the surrounding 
major cities, which include 
Atlanta, Macon, Columbia, Greenville, 
and Augusta. This economic development 
was promised when the lake was 
built in 1984 and I believe we should 
honor our commitment.

(A) the site of cultural, ceremonial, spiritual, 
archaeological, and traditional gathering sites 
of significance to the Pechanga Band of 
Luiseno Mission Indians; 
(B) the site of what is considered to be the 
oldest living coastal live oak; and 
(C) the site of the historic Erle Stanley Gardner 
Ranch. 
(2) Based on the finding described in paragraph 
(1), local and county officials have expressed 
their support for the efforts of the 
Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians to 
have the land described in subsection (b) held in 
trust by the United States for purposes of preservation. 
(b) DECLARATION OF LAND HELD IN TRUST.— 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
land held in fee by the Pechanga Band of 
Luiseno Mission Indians, as described in Document 
No. 211130 of the Riverside County, California 
Office of the Recorder and recorded on 
May 15, 2001, located within the boundaries of 
the county of Riverside within the State of California, 
is hereby declared to be held by the 
United States in trust for the benefit of the 
Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians and 
shall be part of the Pechanga Indian Reservation. 
SEC. 133. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING 
COASTAL IMPACT ASSISTANCE. (a) FINDINGS.— 
Congress finds that— 

(1) the United States continues to be reliant 
on fossil fuels (including crude oil and natural 
gas) as a source of most of the energy consumed 
in the country; 
(2) this reliance is likely to continue for the 
foreseeable future; 
(3) about 65 percent of the energy needs of the 
United States are supplied by oil and natural 
gas; 
(4) the United States is becoming increasingly 
reliant on clean-burning natural gas for electricity 
generation, home heating and air conditioning, 
agricultural needs, and essential chemical 
processes; 
(5) a large portion of the remaining crude oil 
and natural gas resources of the country are on 
Federal land located in the western United 
States, in Alaska, and off the coastline of the 
United States; 
(6) the Gulf of Mexico has proven to be a significant 
source of oil and natural gas and is 
predicted to remain a significant source in the 
immediate future; 
(7) many States and counties oppose the development 
of Federal crude oil and natural gas 
resources within or near the coastline, which 
opposition results in congressional, Executive, 
State, or local policies to prevent the development 
of those resources; 
(8) actions that prevent the development of 
certain Federal crude oil and natural gas resources 
do not lessen the energy needs of the 
United States or of those States and counties 
that object to exploration and development for 
fossil fuels; 
(9) actions to prevent the development of certain 
Federal crude oil and natural gas resources 
focus development pressure on the remaining 
areas of Federal crude oil and natural gas resources, 
such as onshore and offshore Alaska, 
certain onshore areas in the western United 
States, and the central Gulf of Mexico off the 
coasts of Alabama, Alaska, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
and Texas; 
(10) the development of Federal crude oil and 
natural gas resources is accompanied by adverse 
effects on the infrastructure services, public 
services, and the environment of States, counties, 
and local communities that host the development 
of those Federal resources; 
(11) States, counties, and local communities do 
not have the power to tax adequately the development 
of Federal crude oil and natural gas resources, 
particularly when those development 
activities occur off the coastline of States that 
serve as platforms for that development, such as 
Alabama, Alaska, Louisiana, Mississippi, and 
Texas; 
(12) the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et 
seq.), which governs the development of Federal 
crude oil and natural gas resources located onshore, 
provides, outside the budget and appropriations 
processes of the Federal Government, 
payments to States in which Federal crude oil 
and natural gas resources are located in the 
amount of 50 percent of the direct revenues received 
from the Federal Government for those 
resources; and 
(13) there is no permanent provision in the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 
1331 et seq.), which governs the development of 
Federal crude oil and natural gas resources located 
offshore, that authorizes the sharing of a 
portion of the annual revenues generated from 
Federal offshore crude oil and natural gas resources 
with adjacent coastal States that— 
(A) serve as the platform for that development; 
and 
(B) suffer adverse effects on the environment 
and infrastructure of the States. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that Congress should provide a significant 
portion of the Federal offshore mineral revenues 
to coastal States that permit the development 
of Federal mineral resources off the coastline, 
including the States of Alabama, Alaska, 
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.

the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources 
Planning Act. 

SEC. 319. None of the funds in this Act may be 
used to support Government-wide administrative 
functions unless such functions are justified in 
the budget process and funding is approved by 
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.

forest health conditions, which may include the 
repair or reconstruction of roads, bridges, and 
trails on National Forest System lands in the 
wildland-community interface where there is an 
abnormally high risk of fire. The projects shall 
emphasize reducing risks to human safety and 
public health and property and enhancing ecological 
functions, long-term forest productivity, 
and biological integrity. The projects may be 
completed in a subsequent fiscal year. Funds 
shall not be expended under this section to replace 
funds which would otherwise appropriately 
be expended from the timber salvage 
sale fund. Nothing in this section shall be construed 
to exempt any project from any environmental 
law. 

SEC. 322. Other than in emergency situations, 
none of the funds in this Act may be used to operate 
telephone answering machines during core 
business hours unless such answering machines 
include an option that enables callers to reach

SEC. 323. No timber sale in Region 10 shall be 
advertised if the indicated rate is deficit when 
appraised under the transaction evidence appraisal 
system using domestic Alaska values for 
western red cedar: Provided, That sales which 
are deficit when appraised under the transaction 
evidence appraisal system using domestic 
Alaska values for western red cedar may be advertised 
upon receipt of a written request by a 
prospective, informed bidder, who has the opportunity 
to review the Forest Service’s cruise 
and harvest cost estimate for that timber. Program 
accomplishments shall be based on volume 
sold. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2002, 
the annual average portion of the decadal allowable 
sale quantity called for in the current 
Tongass Land Management Plan in sales which 
are not deficit when appraised under the transaction 
evidence appraisal system using domestic 
Alaska values for western red cedar, all of the 
western red cedar timber from those sales which 
is surplus to the needs of domestic processors in 
Alaska, shall be made available to domestic 
processors in the contiguous 48 United States at 
prevailing domestic prices. Should Region 10 
sell, in fiscal year 2002, less than the annual average 
portion of the decadal allowable sale 
quantity called for in the current Tongass Land 
Management Plan in sales which are not deficit 
when appraised under the transaction evidence 
appraisal system using domestic Alaska values 
for western red cedar, the volume of western red 
cedar timber available to domestic processors at 
prevailing domestic prices in the contiguous 48 
United States shall be that volume: (i) which is 
surplus to the needs of domestic processors in 
Alaska; and (ii) is that percent of the surplus 
western red cedar volume determined by calculating 
the ratio of the total timber volume which 
has been sold on the Tongass to the annual average 
portion of the decadal allowable sale 
quantity called for in the current Tongass Land 
Management Plan. The percentage shall be calculated 
by Region 10 on a rolling basis as each 
sale is sold (for purposes of this amendment, a 
‘‘rolling basis’’ shall mean that the determination 
of how much western red cedar is eligible 
for sale to various markets shall be made at the 
time each sale is awarded). Western red cedar 
shall be deemed ‘‘surplus to the needs of domestic 
processors in Alaska’’ when the timber sale 
holder has presented to the Forest Service documentation 
of the inability to sell western red 
cedar logs from a given sale to domestic Alaska 
processors at price equal to or greater than the 
log selling value stated in the contract. All additional 
western red cedar volume not sold to 
Alaska or contiguous 48 United States domestic 
processors may be exported to foreign markets at 
the election of the timber sale holder. All Alaska 
yellow cedar may be sold at prevailing export 
prices at the election of the timber sale holder. 

SEC. 324. None of the funds appropriated by 
this Act shall be used to propose or issue rules, 
regulations, decrees, or orders for the purpose of 

implementation, or in preparation for implementation, 
of the Kyoto Protocol which was adopted 
on December 11, 1997, in Kyoto, Japan at the 
Third Conference of the Parties to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, which has not been submitted to the 
Senate for advice and consent to ratification 
pursuant to article II, section 2, clause 2, of the 
United States Constitution, and which has not 
entered into force pursuant to article 25 of the 
Protocol. 

SEC. 325. The Forest Service, in consultation 
with the Department of Labor, shall review Forest 
Service campground concessions policy to determine 
if modifications can be made to Forest 
Service contracts for campgrounds so that such 
concessions fall within the regulatory exemption 
of 29 CFR 4.122(b). The Forest Service shall offer 
in fiscal year 2002 such concession prospectuses 
under the regulatory exemption, except that, 
any prospectus that does not meet the requirements 
of the regulatory exemption shall be offered 
as a service contract in accordance with 
the requirements of 41 U.S.C. 351–358. 

SEC. 326. A project undertaken by the Forest 
Service under the Recreation Fee Demonstration 
Program as authorized by section 315 of the Department 
of the Interior and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1996, as 
amended, shall not result in— 

(1) displacement of the holder of an authorization 
to provide commercial recreation services 
on Federal lands. Prior to initiating any project, 
the Secretary shall consult with potentially affected 
holders to determine what impacts the 
project may have on the holders. Any modifications 
to the authorization shall be made within 
the terms and conditions of the authorization 
and authorities of the impacted agency. 
(2) the return of a commercial recreation service 
to the Secretary for operation when such 
services have been provided in the past by a private 
sector provider, except when— 
(A) the private sector provider fails to bid on 
such opportunities; 
(B) the private sector provider terminates its 
relationship with the agency; or 
(C) the agency revokes the permit for noncompliance 
with the terms and conditions of the 
authorization. 
In such cases, the agency may use the Recreation 
Fee Demonstration Program to provide for 
operations until a subsequent operator can be 
found through the offering of a new prospectus. 
SEC. 327. The authority to enter into stewardship 
and end result contracts provided to the 
Forest Service in accordance with section 347 of 
title III of section 101(e) of division A of Public 
Law 105–277 is hereby expanded to authorize the 
Forest Service to enter into an additional 28 
contracts subject to the same terms and conditions 
as provided in that section: Provided, That 
of the additional contracts authorized by this 
section at least 9 shall be allocated to Region 1 
and at least 3 to Region 6. 

SEC. 328. Any regulations or policies promulgated 
or adopted by the Departments of Agriculture 
or the Interior regarding recovery of 
costs for processing authorizations to occupy 
and use Federal lands under their control shall 
adhere to and incorporate the following principle 
arising from Office of Management and 
Budget Circular, A–25; no charge should be 
made for a service when the identification of the 
specific beneficiary is obscure, and the service 
can be considered primarily as benefiting broadly 
the general public. 

SEC. 329. Notwithstanding any other provision 
of law, for fiscal year 2002, the Secretary of Agriculture 
is authorized to limit competition for 
fire and fuel treatment and watershed restoration 
contracts in the Giant Sequoia National 
Monument and the Sequoia National Forest. 
Preference for employment shall be given to dislocated 
and displaced workers in Tulare, Kern 
and Fresno Counties, California, for work associated 
with the establishment of the Giant Sequoia 
National Monument. 

SEC. 330. The Secretary of Agriculture, acting 
through the Chief of the Forest Service shall:

AUTHORIZING SENATE OFFICE OF 
SENATOR JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER 
IV BE USED TO COLLECT 
DONATIONS OF CLOTHING 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent the Senate proceed to 
the consideration of S. Res. 134, submitted 
earlier today by Senators 
ROCKEFELLER and BYRD. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 

The legislative clerk read as follows: 

A resolution (S. Res. 134) authorizing that 
the Senate office of Senator John D. Rockefeller 
IV be used to collect donations of 
clothing from July 13, 2001, until July 20, 
2001, from concerned Members of Congress 
and staff to assist the West Virginia families 
suffering from the recent disaster of flooding 
and storms. 

There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 

Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, 
as you may know, my state of 
West Virginia was ravaged last week 
by its worst flooding in years. Homes 
were destroyed, businesses and infrastructure 
were shut down and, most 
tragically, lives were lost. The outpouring 
of support thus far has been 
truly heartwarming; however, much is 
still needed in order to rebuild our 
communities. That is why I am asking 
my colleagues, our staffs, and our 
friends to support this resolution and 
to participate in a clothing drive that 
will give aid to the victims of this tragedy. 
I am proud to be joined by our distinguished 
senior Senator, ROBERT C. 
BYRD, in our effort to help West Virginians. 
Our drive can only be successful 
if the resolution before us is passed, 
and if we each give what we can. 

Immediately following the floods, I 
visited some of the areas hardest hit. 
Although I have seen this type of devastation 
before, I was still taken aback 
by dissolved roads, collapsed homes, 
and splintered bridges. Fortunately, 
the clean-up process is already underway 
as federal disaster relief pours in. 
Organizations such as the American 
Red Cross and the Salvation Army 
have provided for residents’ most immediate 
needs, while agencies such as 
the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, FEMA, begin processing damage 
claims. Governor Wise and state 
agencies are working hard to reach out 
to communities struggling to cope with 
the aftermath of the flooding. Working 
together, federal, state, and local officials 
can begin the crucial work to rebuild 
our communities. 

Yet, much remains to be done. 
Today, Sharon and I will visit more of 
the state. With us, we will take the 
prayers and well-wishes we have been 
given. We will also present generous 
donations from corporations such as 
the Pepsi Cola Company. While I am in 

the state, my staff will organize a 
clothing drive to replace some of the 
items lost in the floods. Clothing of all 
kinds is needed as residents rebuild 
their homes and their lives. Many have 
lost everything and, as they return to 
work and school, will need the basic 
items we all take for granted. Moreover, 
as the winter months approach 
and the season brings rugged weather, 
victims will also find themselves in 
need of cold-weather clothing and 
shoes. Once the clothing is collected on 
Capitol Hill, United Airlines will transport 
all of the donations to West Virginia 
and the National Guard will help 
distribute the clothing to families in 
need. These are just two examples of 
the generosity displayed by companies 
and by individuals who wish to help. 
Each of them has my deep gratitude. 

Of course, in the rush to move on and 
rebuild, we cannot forget about those 
lost. I am enormously sorry for the loss 
of Bonnie Shumate and Bradley Jenkins, 
and my heart goes out to their 
families and friends. Though rebuilding 
will serve as a challenge for the average 
West Virginian, grieving will, of 
course, prove far more difficult for the 
Shumates and the Jenkins. 

It has been said that there is light at 
the end of every tunnel. Considering 
the awesome amount of support provided 
to date for the flood victims in 
West Virginia, I would have to agree. 
Let us continue this support by committing 
to and participating in a clothing 
drive for the people affected by the 
flood. On behalf of the Mountain State, 
thank you. 

Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask 
consent the resolution and preamble be 
agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider 
be laid on the table, and any 
statements and supporting documents 
be printed in the RECORD. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

The resolution (S. Res. 134) was 
agreed to. 

The preamble was agreed to. 

(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
located in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Submitted 
Resolutions.’’)

ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JULY 17, 
2001 

Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that when the Senate 
completes its business today, it adjourn 
until the hour of 9 a.m. tomorrow, 
July 17. 

I further ask consent that on Tuesday, 
immediately following the prayer 
and the pledge, the Journal of proceedings 
be approved to date, the 
morning hour be deemed expired, the 
time for the two leaders be reserved for 
their use later in the day, and the Senate 
resume consideration of the Bankruptcy 
Reform Act; further, that the 
Senate recess from 12:30 to 2:15 for the 
weekly party conferences. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

PROGRAM 

Mr. REID. Madam President, therefore, 
on Tuesday the Senate will convene 
at 9 a.m. and resume consideration 
of the Bankruptcy Reform Act 
under a previous order. There will be 3 
hours of debate on cloture on the 
Bankruptcy Reform Act, which will 
cause us to vote around 12 noon. We expect 
to return to the Energy and Water 
Appropriations Act on Tuesday, with 
rollcall votes expected into the 
evening. 

In the morning I am going to renew 
my request that there be a time certain 
for filing amendments. The reason 
this is so important is we are not going 
to be on this bill tomorrow. That will 
give staff time to work on the amendments 
that people think are important. 
Some certainly are important. So I am 
going to renew that request tomorrow 
morning, and I hope Senators on both 
sides of the aisle will allow us to go 
forward. 

f 


ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate stand in adjournment 
following the remarks of the Senator 
from Arizona and the Senator from Oregon, 
as previously outlined in the 
unanimous-consent agreement. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

NOMINATIONS 
Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me 
say I appreciate what the Senator from 
Nevada said about the reforms that 
Senators DOMENICI, MURKOWSKI, and I 
effectuated with respect to the Department 
of Energy. It was a time of some 
confusion, and reasonable people could 
differ about what we did there. But I 
think it is working out well. I appreciate 
that the Senator from Nevada is 
now very much in support of that. Earlier 
I when spoke, I did no use the 
name of the Senator from Nevada but I 
did thank the Democratic leadership 
for moving nominations with such 
alacrity last week. I think there were 
54 nominations and I think I mentioned 
that I hoped we could continue with 
that progress during the next couple of 
weeks. I wanted the Senator from Nevada 
to know I paid him a compliment 
today as well. 
Mr. REID. I say to my colleague, if 
he will yield, I watched his statement 
from my office, and I appreciate that 
very much. I say to my friend from Arizona, 
it is important we move these 
nominations. There are a few that 
cause problems, but very few. And you 
will know about those. The rest of 
them we need to move forward to have 
better government. 
I think it is very unfair that the system 
has become so complicated, so burdensome, 
that we are having trouble 
getting good people to take these jobs. 
It is amazing to me the quality of the 
people who served in the Clinton administration 
and those who are now 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7713 

willing to serve the Bush administration 
with all they have to go through. 

I look forward to working with my 
friend from Arizona to move as many 
of these as quickly as we can. As I told 
my friend on Friday, we had one person 
with a little problem and we just went 
around that, took care of everybody 
else. Even those we have problems 
with, they deserve their day in court, 
so to speak. So I appreciate the comments 
of the Senator from Arizona. I 
appreciate his cooperation in allowing 
us to have this bill on the floor. 

Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from 
Nevada. 

Madam President, will the Chair advise 
me when I have gone 5 minutes. I 
do not want to impinge anymore on the 
time of the Senator from Oregon.

UNITED STATES-CHINA RELATIONS 

Mr. KYL. Madam President, I wanted 
to speak briefly about the decision 
made last Friday to hold the next 
Olympics in Beijing, the 2008 games. 
Our Government was not involved in 
that. It is not a government-to-government 
kind of decision. But I am hopeful 
the fact that the United States did 
not, as a nation, weigh in on that decision—
I am hopeful that did not send a 
signal to the leaders in Beijing that the 

U.S. Government either supports what 
that Chinese Government leadership 
does or does not object to many of the 
things which are done by that Government 
that violate human rights and in 
other ways suggest the country of 
China is not yet willing to join the 
family of nations. 
I wanted to note a few of the activities 
of this recent Chinese Government 
that suggest to me the United States 
needs to take a very firm position with 
respect to China. That is why I say I 
am hopeful this decision that the 
Olympics go to China not be mistaken 
for U.S. support for what China has 
done. 

As illustrated in recent press reports, 
China’s bid for that honor has been the 
subject of much international attention. 
For example, the European Union 
Parliament recently passed a resolution 
declaring that China’s bid is ‘‘inappropriate’’ 
and that it is ‘‘unsuitable’’ 
for the Games due to its ‘‘disastrous 
record on human rights.’’ 

The American government, however, 
chose to remain neutral on China’s 
bid—a decision that I hope will not 
convey to China’s leaders a signal that 
the United States is willing to blindly 
tolerate that country’s continuing failure 
to abide by internationally-recognized 
norms of behavior. Consider just 
a few events of recent months: 

The collision of our reconnaissance 
plane with a Chinese fighter jet—the 
result of a Chinese pilot’s aggressive 
flying. 

China’s detention and interrogation 
of our plane’s crew for nearly two 
weeks, and submission of a $1 million 
bill to the United States. 

China’s detention and arrest of 
American citizens and permanent resi


dents without clear evidence of wrongdoing 
or illegal activity—including 
Gao Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Li Shaomin, 
and Tan Guangguang. Li Shaomin was 
convicted of espionage on July 14 and 
reportedly will be expelled from China 
in the near future. 

China’s systematic torture and murder 
of hundreds of members of the 
Falun Gong—including the recent 
deaths of approximately fourteen 
peaceful adherents in a Chinese labor 
camp. 

China’s hardening of its crackdown 
on this group—including a new legal directive 
issued by Chinese judicial authorities 
on June 10 authorizing courts 
to prosecute Falun Gong practitioners 
for intentional wounding or murder, or 
for organizing, encouraging or helping 
other followers commit suicide or injure 
themselves. Additionally, it states 
that followers can be prosecuted if they 
produce or distribute anti-government 
materials. 

China’s execution of at least 1,781 
persons during the past three months— 
more than the total number of executions 
worldwide over the past three 
years 

A former Chinese doctor’s testimony 
on June 27 to the House International 
Relations Committee that his job required 
him ‘‘to remove skin and corneas 
from the corpses of over one hundred 
executed prisoners, and, on a couple 
of occasions, victims of intentionally 
botched executions.’’ 

The Chinese military’s ongoing 
large-scale military exercises in the 
South China Sea aimed at preparing 
that country for an invasion of Taiwan. 

China’s shipments to Cuba of arms 
and explosives, the latest of which reportedly 
occurred in December. 

China’s continuing assistance and 
provision of military technology to 
rogue regimes, including the case involving 
the Chinese firm that helped 
Iraq outfit its air defenses with fiber-
optic equipment. 

China’s continuing purchases from 
Russia of conventional weapons, including 
plans to purchase two additional 
Sovremenny destroyers armed 
with Sunburn anti-ship cruise missiles. 

There is no doubt that dealing with 
China will continue to be a challenge. 

Whatever we do, we have to make 
sure that we don’t send signals to 
China that we approve of these kinds of 
actions. Not standing in the way of 
their getting the Olympic games I hope 
will not send that kind of a signal. 

And there is no alternative. It is the 
world’s most populous nation (and biggest 
potential market); it has the 
world’s largest armed forces; and it is a 
permanent member of the U.N. Security 
Council. Its economic and military 
strength has grown a great deal in recent 
years, and is projected to continue 
to grow significantly in the coming 
decades. 

There are many areas of potential 
disagreement with other nations, such 
as trade policy and human rights violations. 
But the one source of potentially 

catastrophic consequences is China’s 
insistence that, by negotiation or force, 
Taiwan must be reunited with the 
mainland, and that conflict with the 
United States is inevitable as long as 
we stand in the way of that objective. 
We cannot ignore this very real and potentially 
dangerous situation. How we 
deal with it will dictate the course of 
history. 

The United States must develop a 
more comprehensive and realistic policy 
toward China, one which promotes 
good relations while not ignoring unpleasant 
exigencies. 

In March, two days prior to the collision 
over the South China Sea, I spoke 
on the Senate floor about the challenge 
of dealing with China’s growing military 
strength. I discussed in detail China’s 
threatening rhetoric aimed at the 
United States and Taiwan, and warned 
of that country’s rapid military modernization 
and buildup. And most importantly, 
I asked the question: what if 
China’s leaders mean what they say? 
To assume they do not, particularly in 
light of the prevalence of highly 
threatening public statements and 
military writings could mean leaving 
ourselves deliberately vulnerable to potential 
Chinese aggression, (or impotent 
to deal with Chinese aggression 
against others). 

China, unfortunately, has not been a 
very cooperative member of the international 
community. Several years 
ago, at a New Atlantic Initiative conference 
in Prague, I discussed America’s 
role in that community and our 
vision for a world in which the United 
States could work side-by-side with 
other democracies, stating, 

If I had to sum up in one sentence the U.S. 
national interest in the world, I would say 
that it is promoting the security, well-being, 
and expansion of the community of nations 
that respect the democratic rights of their 
peoples. 

China cannot become a member of 
this trusted family until there is a serious 
change in the attitude of its leadership. 
Indeed, China’s leaders systematically 
violate the most fundamental 
rights of the Chinese people. Moreover, 
they increasingly lack respect for the 
democratic rights of individuals visiting 
China, including U.S. citizens. 
The Chinese government seeks to 
maintain absolute control over all domestic 
political matters. It remains resistant 
to what it considers interference 
in its internal affairs, threatening 
the use of force, if necessary, to 
achieve its objectives, including reunification 
with Taiwan. And China actively 
pursues foreign policies that risk 
destabilizing the South China Sea. 

In the long-term, our goal must be to 
live in peace and prosperity with the 
Chinese people; however, to do so requires 
that we reconcile the different 
aspirations of our governments. It is 
clear that many of the Chinese government’s 
goals conflict with American 
values, and it is important that we do 
not to compromise these values in 
dealing with the communist regime. 


S7714 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

We should, instead, encourage China to 
adopt a less aggressive and less threatening 
attitude through firm and principled 
interactions with that country’s 
leaders. 

Since the formal establishment of 
the People’s Republic of China in 1949, 
the United States has purposely remained 
ambiguous about the degree to 
which we recognize the governments in 
Beijing and Taipei. Our ‘‘One-China’’ 
policy, dating back to the Shanghai 
Communique of 1972, has served U.S. 
strategic and economic interests, allowing 
the United States to peacefully 
retain ties with China and Taiwan. 

On one subject, however, there 
should be no ambiguity—U.S. policy in 
the event China should ever attack 
democratic Taiwan. That is why I am 
pleased that President Bush made very 
clear to China that the United States 
will actively resist any such aggression. 
Yet even those measures ostensibly 
intended to eliminate any doubt 
of our commitment to Taiwan have not 
been so concrete. While we presented 
Taiwan with an arms package that will 
help that island build its defensive 
forces, the United States cannot ensure 
that Taiwan will ever receive the diesel 
submarines that were included since we 
do not build them and it remains unclear 
as to whether another country 
would be willing to provide a design for 
them. 

Additionally, President Bush chose 
not to include Aegis destroyers in this 
arms package, though he reserves the 
right to sell them in the future should 
China continue or increase its belligerent 
behavior toward Taiwan. In light 
of China’s military exercises in the 
South China Sea, perhaps now is the 
time to seriously consider this option. 

We must be very clear in our own 
minds about our strategic intentions 
and just as clear in signaling these intentions 
to China. The object is to 
avoid a situation in which China’s leaders 
miscalculate and are tempted to 
use force against Taiwan in the mistaken 
belief that they won’t meet 
resistence from the United States. 

History is replete with examples of 
ambiguity fostering aggression. Perceptions 
of American ambivalence contributed 
to North Korea’s invasion of 
South Korea and Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, 
for example. 

We have also observed instances 
where conflict never occurred because 
of the resoluteness of our stance. Our 
unambiguous commitment to contain 
Soviet expansion and defend our Western 
European allies during the Cold 
War enabled Western Europe to escape 
the grip of communism. And it led to 
one of the greatest accomplishments in 
history: the West’s victory without war 
over the Soviet Empire. 

There is an old saying that, ‘‘There is 
nothing wrong with making mistakes. 
Just don’t respond with encores.’’ Let 
us not repeat the mistake—failing to 
signal our commitment to defend our 
friends and our interests—that has 
many times led the United States to 

military conflict. China should be certain 
that we will help Taiwan resist 
any aggression against it. 

We should make every effort to work 
with China, trade with China and seek 
greater understanding of our mutual 
cultures—while, at the same time, appropriately 
dealing with all aspects of 
China’s troubling behavior. This offers 
our greatest hope for maintaining a 
balanced relationship near-term and 
helping to bring about change in the 
communist regime in the longer term. 
While reconciling our two very different 
views about the relationship of a 
nation’s people to its government requires 
patience, and even some short-
term compromise, the United States 
cannot remain true to its fundamental 
belief in the natural rights of man 
without promoting respect for human 
rights, the rule of law, and the embrace 
of democracy by all governments, including 
the government of China. 

There are five specific aspects of China’s 
behavior that require a straightforward, 
firm response from United 
States: China’s proliferation of ballistic 
missiles and weapons of mass destruction; 
its threats and corresponding 
military buildup opposite 
Taiwan; its threatening rhetoric and 
missile buildup aimed at the United 
States; its human rights abuses; and its 
history of refusing to play by economic 
rules. 

China is perhaps the world’s worst 
proliferator of the technology used to 
develop and produce ballistic missiles 
and weapons of mass destruction. Beijing 
has sold ballistic missile technology 
to Iran, North Korea, Syria, 
Libya, and Pakistan. It has also sold 
nuclear technology to Iran and Pakistan. 
It has aided Iran’s chemical weapons 
program and sold that nation advanced 
cruise missiles. And it has sold 
Iraq fiber-optic cables, and assisted 
with their installation between antiaircraft 
batteries, radar stations, and 
command centers. 

Chinese assistance has been vital to 
the missile and weapons of mass destruction 
programs in these countries. 
And because of this assistance, the 
American people and our forces and 
friends abroad now face a much greater 
threat. 

The United States needs to impose 
sanctions on Chinese organizations and 
government entities for their proliferation 
activities, as required by U.S. 
laws. Sanctions need not be the first or 
only tool used in the fight against proliferation. 
Nor, however, should this 
tool grow rusty from disuse. As the 
Washington Post noted in an editorial 
on July 14, 2000, ‘‘China’s continuing 
assistance to Pakistan’s weapons program 
in the face of so many U.S. efforts 
to talk Beijing out of it shows the 
limits of a nonconfrontational approach.’’ 
We must back our frequent 
expressions of concern with actions if 
our words are to be perceived as credible. 


Unfortunately, the United States has 
all too often sent a signal to Beijing 

that its irresponsible behavior will be 
tolerated by failing to enforce U.S. 
laws requiring sanctions, or doing so in 
ways deliberately calculated to undermine 
the intent of the sanctions. For 
example, China transferred M–11 missiles 
and production technology to 
Pakistan in violation of the Missile 
Technology Control Regime, despite 
promising to adhere to that agreement. 

U.S. law requires sanctions to be imposed 
on nations that transfer technology 
regulated by the MTCR. In 1993, 
the Clinton Administration imposed 
sanctions on China’s Ministry of Defense 
and eleven Chinese defense and 
aerospace entities for violations of Category 
2 of the MTCR—despite the fact 
that the M–11 transfers were Category 1 
violations—thereby imposing the mildest 
form of sanctions possible. Then, in 
return for a Chinese promise in October 
1994 not to export ‘‘ground-to-ground 
missiles’’ covered by the MTCR, the 
Clinton Administration waived the 
sanctions. 
After the waiver, despite a steady 
stream of press reports, Congressional 
testimony, and unclassified reports by 
the intelligence community that described 
China’s continued missile assistance 
to Pakistan, the Clinton Administration 
did not impose sanctions 
as required by law. Assistant Secretary 
of State for Nonproliferation Robert 
Einhorn said in Senate testimony in 
1997 that sanctions had not been invoked 
on China for the sale of M–11s to 
Pakistan because the Administration’s 
‘‘. . . level of confidence [was] not sufficient 
to take a decision that [had] 
very far-reaching consequences.’’ The 
Clinton Administration appeared to 
have purposely set a standard of evidence 
so high that it was unattainable. 

Madam President, China has promised 
six times during the past two decades 
not to transfer missiles and missile 
technology—in 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 
1994, and 2000—and six times has broken 
its promises without any consequences. 
It is no wonder that China 
does not take seriously its obligations. 

I recently joined several of my colleagues 
in sending a letter to President 
Bush expressing concern about Beijing’s 
continuing proliferation activities. 
The letter states: 

The PRC’s most recent missile nonproliferation 
promise was made on November 
21, 2000. China promised not to assist, in any 
way, any country in the development of ballistic 
missiles that can be used to deliver nuclear 
weapons, and to abide by the MTCR. 
The PRC further pledged to issue export regulations 
covering dual-use technologies. 
However, no regulations have been promulgated, 
and we are concerned that China has 
continued to transfer missile equipment and 
technology in contravention of both the 
MTCR and its November pledge. 

In return for China’s November 2000 
pledge, the previous administration 
‘‘swept the decks clean,’’ sanctioning 
numerous Chinese entities for their activities 
and subsequently waiving those 
sanctions. And again it appears as 
though China may be continuing to 
transfer missile equipment and technology. 
We do not need more empty 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7715 

promises from China—we need action. 
It is important that the Bush Administration 
signal to China by imposing 
sanctions required by U.S. nonproliferation 
statutes and making 
them stick that the United States will 
no longer tolerate that country’s irresponsible 
proliferation activities. 

In addition to enforcing nonproliferation 
laws, we should also resist efforts 
to weaken controls on the export of 
dual-use technologies, which China can 
use to further modernize its military, 
as well as transfer to other countries. 
In particular, I am concerned that the 
Export Administration Act of 2001 
would reduce the ability of the U.S. 
government to maintain effective export 
controls on such items. 

An Asian Wall Street Journal op-ed 
published on March 19 by two researchers 
at the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear 
Arms Control described how the 
Chinese firm that helped Iraq outfit its 
air defenses with fiber-optic equipment 
has purchased a significant amount of 
technology from U.S. firms and is seeking 
to import more. For example, the 
op-ed indicated that one such firm has 
applied for an export license to teach 
this Chinese company how to build 
high-speed switching and routing 
equipment that will allow communications 
to be shuttled quickly across 
multiple transmission lines. The U.S. 
government should have the ability to 
deny exports of dual-use technology to 
a company such as the Chinese firm in 
this case. 

The second of five areas of concern is 
China’s belligerent behavior toward 
Taiwan. China is intent on gaining control 
over that island—by force if necessary—
and is taking the necessary 
military preparations that would enable 
it to do so. According to an article 
published in the Washington Post on 
April 27, Wu Xinbo, a professor at 
Fudan University’s Center for American 
Studies in Shanghai, stated: 

At this moment it’s very difficult to argue 
that there’s still a high prospect for a peaceful 
solution of the Taiwan issue . . . From a 
Chinese perspective there has to be a solution 
to Taiwan either way, peacefully or 
with the use of force. Given [the] change in 

U.S. policy . . . you have to give more weight 
to the second option.’’ 
The ‘‘change’’ to which he was referring 
was the U.S. commitment to come 
to Taiwan’s defense articulated by 
President Bush. 

China’s threats have been backed by 
rapid efforts to modernize its military. 
The immediate focus of the modernization 
is to build a military force capable 
of subduing Taiwan swiftly enough to 
prevent American intervention. According 
to the Department of Defense’s 
Annual Report on the Military Power 
of the People’s Republic of China, released 
in June 2000, ‘‘A cross-strait 
conflict between China and Taiwan involving 
the United States has emerged 
as the dominant scenario guiding [the 
Chinese Army’s] force planning, military 
training, and war preparation.’’ 

To solidify its ability to launch an 
attack against Taiwan, China is in


creasing its force of short-range ballistic 
missiles opposite the island. According 
to an article in the Wall Street 
Journal on April 23, U.S. defense officials 
estimate that China currently has 
300 such missiles aimed at the island, 
and is increasing this number at a rate 
of 50 per year. 

China is also in the process of modernizing 
its air force and navy. The Defense 
Department’s June 2000 report 
predicted that after 2005, ‘‘. . . if projected 
trends continue, the balance of 
air power across the Taiwan Strait 
could begin to shift in China’s favor.’’ 
The same report warned, ‘‘China’s submarine 
fleet could constitute a substantial 
force capable of controlling 
sea lanes and mining approaches 
around Taiwan, as well as a growing 
threat to submarines in the East and 
South China Seas.’’ 

In response to the growing threat and 
Taiwan’s increasing vulnerability to an 
attack, President Bush approved the 
sale to Taiwan of some much-needed 
defensive military equipment. As 
noted, however, the sales are limited in 
practical effect and, in any event, must 
be accompanied by proper training and 
coordination with the U.S. military in 
order to be useful in conflict. 

In addition to the Chinese military’s 
investment in hardware, Beijing has increasingly 
focused on advanced training 
methods, demonstrating joint-service 
war-fighting skills in its military 
exercises that are steadily altering the 
balance of power across the Taiwan 
Strait. Over the past several years, 
these exercises have shifted from an intimidation 
tactic to a more serious effort 
intended to prepare China for an 
invasion of Taiwan. 

Beijing’s amphibious exercises at 
Dongshan Island in the Taiwan Strait 
have illustrated this increasing level of 
sophistication in war-fighting tactics 
and interoperability. A Chinese state-
owned newspaper, Hong Kong Ming 
Pao, reported on June 1 that China’s 
Central Military Commission proposed 
that these exercises be held near Taiwan 
‘‘in order to warn the United 
States and the Taiwan authorities not 
to play with fire over the Taiwan 
issue.’’ Furthermore, according to the 
same article, ‘‘the main aim of this exercise 
will be to attack and occupy Taiwan’s 
offshore islands and to counterattack 
U.S. military intervention.’’ 
Another article in the state-owned 
Hong Kong Wen Wei Po on June 4 stated 
that the purpose of the exercise 
‘‘not only includes capture of [the islands 
around Taiwan], but also how to 
tenaciously defend these islands and 
turn them into wedges for driving into 
the heart of the enemy.’’ 

According to an article in the New 
York Times on July 11, the official Chinese 
publication, International Outlook 
Magazine, described in detail 
these recent ‘‘war games’’. The games 
reportedly occurred in three stages. 
The first, information warfare, was intended 
to paralyze enemy communications 
and command systems electroni


cally. The second involved a joint 
navy, infantry, and air force landing on 
Dongshan Island. And the third, according 
to the Chinese publication, 
simulated a ‘‘counterattack against an 
enemy fleet attempting to intervene in 
the war.’’ It was also reported that this 
final stage incorporated Russian-
bought SU–27 fighter aircraft. Thus far, 
military experts state that China has 
had difficulty incorporating these aircraft 
into its arsenal, and its ability to 
do so indicates a significant improvement 
in its ability to integrate military 
operations. 

Taiwan’s war-fighting skills are not 
nearly as advanced. For over twenty 
years, the United States has cut Taiwan 
off from the intellectual capital 
that should accompany the hardware 
we sell, thus reducing the readiness of 
that island’s forces. Our defense officials 
and military personnel need to be 
able work with their Taiwanese counterparts 
to ensure that they know how 
to use the equipment and they will be 
capable of operating alongside U.S. 
forces. Increased interaction would better 
prepare Taiwan’s military to defend 
itself in the event of a Chinese attack, 
reduce the possibility that the United 
States would need to become involved 
in such a conflict, and inevitably save 
lives. 

This leads directly to the third area 
of concern—China’s actions that directly 
threaten America. China’s harsh 
rhetoric aimed at the United States is 
accompanied by Beijing’s build-up of 
long-range missiles targeted at our cities, 
acquisition of anti-ship cruise missiles 
to counter U.S. carrier battle 
groups, and development of 
cyberwarfare and anti-satellite capabilities. 
China also understands the importance 
of aggressive intelligence operations 
against the United States. 

In February 2000, the People’s Liberation 
Army Daily, a state-owned newspaper, 
warned the United States 
against intervening in a conflict in the 
Taiwan Strait, stating, 

On the Taiwan issue, it is very likely that 
the United States will walk to the point 
where it injures others while ruining itself 
. . . China is neither Iraq or Yugoslavia . . . 
it is a country that has certain abilities of 
launching a strategic counterattack and the 
capacity of launching a long-distance strike. 
Probably it is not a wise move to be at war 
with a country such as China, a point which 

U.S. policymakers know fairly well also.’’ 
China is, in fact, continuing to increase 
its capacity to launch a long-
distance strike against the United 
States. The Defense Department’s report, 
Proliferation: Threat and Response, 
states: 

China currently has over 100 nuclear warheads. 
. . While the ultimate extent of China’s 
strategic modernization is unknown, it 
is clear that the number, reliability, survivability, 
and accuracy of Chinese strategic 
missiles capable of hitting the United States 
will increase during the next two decades. 

China currently has about 20 CSS–4 ICBMs 
with a range of over 13,000 kilometers, which 
can reach the United States. Some of its ongoing 
missile modernization programs likely 


S7716 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

will increase the number of Chinese warheads 
aimed at the United States. For example, 
Beijing is developing two new road-mobile 
solid-propellant ICBMs. China has conducted 
successful flight tests of the DF–31 
ICBM in 1999 and 2000; this missile is estimated 
to have a range of about 8,000 kilometers. 
Another longer-range mobile ICBM 
also is under development and likely will be 
tested within the next several years. It will 
be targeted primarily against the United 
States.’’ 

China’s military has also taken steps 
to improve its capability to counter 

U.S. carrier battle groups, in response 
to its encounter with the U.S. Navy in 
1996. It has acquired two Sovremenny 
destroyers from Russia armed with 
Sunburn anti-ship cruise missiles, and 
according to an article in the Washington 
Times on May 4, plans to purchase 
two more. These weapons were 
designed to attack U.S. carriers and 
Aegis ships during the Cold War and 
are a significant improvement to the 
Chinese Navy’s capabilities in this 
area. 
In addition to its buildup of conventional 
and nuclear weapons, China’s 
military is also placing an emphasis on 
information warfare, including computer 
network attacks and anti-satellite 
operations. In September 2000, 
the U.S. Navy identified China, among 
several others, as having an acknowledged 
policy of preparing for 
cyberwarfare and as rapidly developing 
its capabilities. In fact, an article in 
the People’s Liberation Army Daily in 
1999 stated that the Chinese military 
planned to elevate information warfare 
to a separate service on par with its 
army, navy and air force. 

Also of great concern is the Chinese 
military’s development of a broad 
range of counterspace measures, including 
an anti-satellite (ASAT) capability. 
According to China’s Strategic 
Modernization: Implications for the 
United States, written by Mark 
Stokes, ‘‘Chinese strategists and engineers 
perceive U.S. reliance on communications, 
reconnaissance, and navigation 
satellites as a potential Achilles’ 
heel.’’ The Defense Department’s June 
2000 report warned that China may already 
possess the capability to damage 
optical sensors on satellites and furthermore, 
that it may have acquired 
high-energy laser equipment and technical 
assistance that could be used in 
the development of ground-based ASAT 
weapons. 

An article in Jane’s Missiles and 
Rockets on May 1 confirmed the Defense 
Department’s warning, stating 
that China’s state-run press reports indicate 
that country is, in fact, developing 
an ASAT capability. It is currently 
in the ground-testing phase and 
will start flight testing in 2002. 

In light of China’s threatening rhetoric 
and its efforts to acquire the capabilities 
that could allow it to carry out 
those threats, we must begin to implement 
a broad range of measures that 
will safeguard our national security. 

First, we need to develop and deploy 
a missile defense system to protect 

ourselves and our allies from an accidental 
or deliberate missile launch and 
to eliminate the possibility of blackmail 
by hostile powers. As President 
Bush recently stated in a speech to the 
National Defense University, 

We must seek security based on more than 
the grim premise that we can destroy those 
who seek to destroy us. . . . We need a new 
framework that allows us to build missile defenses 
to counter the different threats of today’s 
world. To do so, we must move beyond 
the constraints of the 30 year old ABM Treaty. 
This treaty does not recognize the 
present, or point us in the future. It enshrines 
the past. No treaty that prevents us 
from pursuing promising technology to defend 
ourselves, our friends and our allies is 
in our interests or in the interests of world 
peace. 

Second, the United States needs to 
develop better anti-ship cruise missile 
defenses. Systems to counter the cruise 
missile threat have lagged behind the 
level of that threat, despite the fact 
that, according to the U.S. Navy, over 
75 nations possess more than 90 different 
types of anti-ship cruise missiles. 


We must also prepare for China’s potential 
use of information warfare. It is 
important that we find ways to protect 
our computer networks from hacking, 
to eliminate future lapses in security, 
as most recently occurred at Sandia 
National Laboratory in Mexico. According 
to an article in the Washington 
Times on March 16, this attack has 
been partially attributed to hackers 
with links to the Chinese government. 

The United States should also develop 
defenses against China’s ASAT 
weapons. As the Commission to Assess 
United States National Security, Space 
Management and Organization recently 
concluded: 

The present extent of U.S. dependence on 
space, the rapid pace at which this dependence 
is increasing and the vulnerabilities it 
creates, all demand that U.S. national security 
space interests be recognized as a top 
national priority. 

With this goal in mind, Secretary 
Rumsfeld recently announced a reorganization 
of our Nation’s space programs. 
Moreover, President Bush, recognizing 
U.S. reliance on our network 
of satellites for civilian and military 
uses, has stressed the need for ‘‘great 
effort and new spending’’ to protect our 
satellites from attack. 

Of course, our ability to defend 
against China’s increasing military capabilities 
is largely dependent on our 
knowledge of their development. We 
must do a better job of ascertaining 
Chinese government plans and intentions 
(and proliferation activities) and 
improve our counterintelligence vis-avis 
China. 

The fourth area of concern is the Chinese 
government’s deplorable human 
rights record that, according to the 
State Department’s Country Reports 
on Human Rights Practices, has continued 
to deteriorate over the past 
year. The report states: 

The [Chinese] Government continued to 
commit widespread and well-documented 

human rights abuses in violation of internationally 
accepted norms. These abuses 
stemmed from the authorities’ extremely 
limited tolerance of public dissent aimed at 
the Government, fear of unrest, and the limited 
scope or inadequate implementation of 
laws protecting basic freedoms . . . Abuses 
included instances of extrajudicial killings, 
the use of torture, forced confessions, arbitrary 
arrest and detention, the mistreatment 
of prisoners, lengthy incommunicado detention, 
and denial of due process. 

According to an Amnesty International 
report on June 7, China has 
executed at least 1,781 persons during 
the past 3 months—more than the total 
number of executions worldwide over 
the past 3 years. Moreover, the report 
indicates that 2,960 people have been 
sentenced to death in China during this 
brief time period. 

What is the significance to the 
United States of such abuses? First, 
they are not only directed at Chinese 
citizens; they are also directed at 
Americans. Second, if China is to become 
a reliable member of the international 
community, it must begin to 
adhere to accepted norms of behavior. 
In this regard, China’s leaders seem to 
be oblivious to the understanding that 
all people deserve certain basic freedoms 
and that violation of such fundamental 
rights is an appropriate concern 
of the United States and the world 
at large. For example, when questioned 
by the Washington Post about China’s 
detention of several Americans, Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin stated, 
‘‘. . . the United States is the most developed 
country in the world in terms 
of its economy and it high-tech; its 
military is also very strong. You have 
a lot of things to occupy yourself with 
. . . why do you frequently take special 
interest in cases such as this?’’ 

Jiang Zemin’s perplexity speaks volumes. 
Until the Chinese leadership understands 
why Americans and most of 
the rest of the world make such ‘‘a big 
deal’’ over denial of the rule of law, it 
will be hard to reach a reconciliation of 
our mutual aspirations. For example, 
the Chinese government’s continued 
detention of two American citizens and 
two U.S. permanent residents—Gao 
Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Li Shaomin, and 
Tan Guangguang—is unacceptable, and 
should be much more the focus of official 
U.S. government attention. One of 
these individuals, Li Shaomin was convicted 
of espionage on July 14 and is 
expected to be deported from China. 
With regard to the others, China has 
failed to present evidence of wrongdoing 
or illegal activity, or indicate 
when their cases might begin to move 
forward. 

President Bush addressed China’s detention 
of Americans in a phone conversation 
with Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin on July 6, making clear that 
they should be ‘‘treated fairly and returned 
promptly.’’ These words need to 
be reinforced with actions. While the 
State Department issued a travel advisory 
in March to American citizens and 
permanent residents of Chinese descent 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7717 

traveling to China who have connections 
to Taiwan or have openly criticized 
the Chinese government, we can 
also deny visas to Chinese officials, 
seek international sanctions, and continue 
to link an improvement in 
human rights to other policies, as we 
did with the Soviet Union and Eastern 
Europe. 

As I mentioned earlier, I am concerned 
that our government’s neutrality 
on Beijing’s ultimately successful 
bid to host the 2008 Olympic Games 
may send a signal of U.S. tolerance of 
China’s inappropriate behavior. With 
the Secretary of State visiting China 
to help prepare for the President’s trip 
this fall, there is an opportunity to reinforce 
our opposition to the repressive 
behavior of China’s leaders. While some 
hope otherwise, it seems unlikely that 
the International Olympic Committee’s 
choice of Beijing will bring about 
positive change in the communist regime. 
In fact, I fear that the decision 
could serve to strengthen the standing 
of China’s communist leaders in the 
world, as the 1936 Games glorified and 
emboldened Nazi Germany. 

The only hope for a positive result of 
China hosting the games is a concerted 
effort by our government, Europeans 
(and others) and human rights groups 
using the occasion to push China’s 
leaders. The multitude of media covering 
the games can also help. 

During the 1980’s President Reagan 
was a champion for human rights, 
standing up for freedom, democracy, 
and civil society. He passionately 
spoke of American values and universally-
recognized rights, and more importantly, 
backed his words with action. 
In his 1982 ‘‘Evil Empire’’ speech 
before the British House of Commons, 
President Reagan stated: 

While we must be cautious about forcing 
the pace of change, we must not hesitate to 
declare our ultimate objectives and to take 
concrete actions to move toward them. We 
must be staunch in our conviction that freedom 
is not the sole prerogative of a lucky 
few but the inalienable and universal right of 
all human beings. 

This is the course we must chart in 
the coming years. China must understand 
that a friendly, productive relationship 
with the United States can 
only be based upon mutually shared 
values. Beijing’s human rights abuses 
are anathema to the American people, 
and relations cannot reach their full 
potential as long as the communist 
government continues to violate the 
most fundamental rights of worship, 
peaceful assembly, and open discourse. 
A failure to reconcile this most basic 
attitude will result in continued 
strained relations. 

The final area of concern is that, in 
addition to its violation of other international 
norms, China has a history of 
failing to play by accepted economic 
rules, placing an extensive set of requirements 
on companies that wish to 
do business in China and imposing an 
array of trade barriers on imports that 
compete directly with products made 

by domestic Chinese firms. Such barriers 
make it difficult for U.S. companies 
to penetrate China’s market. The 
result is a surging U.S. trade deficit between 
us, reaching $85 billion in 2000. 

On June 1, President Bush submitted 
to Congress a determination extending 
normal trade relations status to China 
for another year, allowing that country’s 
WTO (World Trade Organization) 
negotiations to continue. Not until 
these negotiations are completed and 
China has acceded to the WTO will the 
permanent normal trade status approved 
by the 106th Congress take effect. 


In June, China took a significant 
step toward WTO accession by completing 
its bilateral WTO agreement 
with the United States. That country 
must now complete bilateral negotiations 
with Mexico and resolve several 
outstanding issues related to its multilateral 
agreement before its accession 
package proceeds to the WTO’s Working 
Party, and then to the WTO’s General 
Council, for approval. 

As a member of the WTO, China will 
be required to play by the same rules 
as all other members. China’s membership 
in this organization has the potential 
to improve our trading relationship, 
benefitting many American businesses 
and consumers, as long as China 
holds to its agreements. 

Finally, we expect that China’s accession 
to the WTO will be immediately 
followed by Taiwan’s accession 
to this organization. Last September, I 
received a letter from President Clinton 
that responded to a letter I sent 
him in July 2000 (along with 30 other 
Senators), that sought assurances that 
his Administration remained committed 
to Taiwan’s entry to the WTO 
under terms acceptable to Taiwan. In 
the letter the former President stated 
that, ‘‘My administration remains 
firmly committed to the goal of WTO 
General Council approval of the accession 
packages for China and Taiwan at 
the same session.’’ The letter went on 
to say that ‘‘China has made clear on 
many occasions, and at high levels, 
that it will not oppose Taiwan’s accession 
to the WTO.’’ However, the President 
acknowledged that, ‘‘China did 
submit proposed language to their 
working party stating that Taiwan is a 
separate customs territory of China,’’ 
but went on to say that it had ‘‘advised 
the Chinese that such language is inappropriate 
and irrelevant to the work of 
the working party and that we will not 
accept it.’’ 

Further, in a September 2000 letter to 
Senators LOTT and DASCHLE, President 
Clinton stated: 

. . . I am confident we have a common understanding 
that both China and Taiwan will 
be invited to accede to the WTO under the 
language agreed to in 1992, namely as the 
Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, 
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (referred to as 
‘‘Chinese Taipei.). The United States will 
not accept any other outcome. 

We must continue to make clear to 
China that it would be unacceptable to 

the United States for China to fail to 
live up to its commitments not to 
block Taiwan’s entry to the WTO as a 
separate customs territory, Chinese 
Taipei, not a customs territory of 
China. 

Mr. President, let me briefly recap 
the concerns I have raised today regarding 
China’s proliferation of ballistic 
missiles and weapons of mass destruction, 
its threats and military 
buildup opposite Taiwan and the 
United States, it human rights abuses, 
and its history of failing to play by accepted 
economic rules. 

I believe our policy toward China 
should be one of strength and firmness, 
with friendly intentions, but never 
compromising U.S. principles. In the 
long-term, our goal must be to live in 
peace and prosperity with the Chinese 
people; however, to do so requires that 
China’s leaders begin to alter their behavior. 
As Robert Kagan and William 
Kristol wrote on April 16 in the Weekly 
Standard, with regard to China’s handling 
of the collision of our reconnaissance 
plane and China’s fighter jet, 
‘‘China hands both inside and outside 
the government will argue that this 
crisis needs to be put behind us so that 
the U.S.-China relationship can return 
to normal. It is past time for everyone 
to wake up to the fact that the Chinese 
behavior we have seen is normal.’’ To 
conduct business as usual with a communist 
regime that mistreats its people 
and threatens the security of Americans 
and our allies would be a dereliction 
of our duty as a world leader. We 
have no higher obligation than the protection 
of Americans, and the support 
of our friends and allies, including Taiwan, 
which stands to lose the freedoms 
it has worked so hard to sustain in face 
of resistance from China’s communist 
regime. 

During his ‘‘Sinews of Peace’’ address 
in 1946, Winston Churchill stated, 

Our difficulties and dangers will not be removed 
by closing our eyes to them. They 
will not be removed by mere waiting to see 
what happens; nor will they be removed by a 
policy of appeasement. 

As it has so often been said, those 
who ignore history are condemned to 
repeat it. In the face of obvious belligerency 
and determination to impose a 
different set of rules by China’s leadership, 
the United States must not repeat 
the mistakes of the past. We cannot 
stand idle or look away in the face 
of the Chinese behavior and rhetoric I 
have discussed. 

There is no doubt that China will 
play a larger role on the world stage in 
the coming years. Our goal must be to 
ensure that China’s leaders do not assume 
that this heightened stature 
grants them the right to attack Taiwan 
or be a force for belligerency and 
instability in the world. 

Dealing with China will be a challenge, 
but America does not fear challenge. 
Our greatest hope for change remains, 
as it has always been, to stand 
firmly as a force for peace and 
progress, and to champion no less for 


S7718 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE July 16, 2001 

the people of other countries what we 
guarantee for our own citizens. I am 
confident that, if we make clear our 
friendly intentions to China and follow 
through with actions that reinforce our 
words, Beijing will, in time, respond 
positively, Taiwan will continue to 
flourish, and China can be welcomed as 
a peaceful and productive member to 
the community of nations. 

I express the hope that by holding 
those games in Beijing, the media, 
human rights organizations, and others 
will work to hold the Chinese leadership 
accountable for what goes on in 
that nation. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Oregon. 

Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, before 
he leaves the floor, I want to express 
my thanks to the Senator from 
Arizona. Because of his thoughtfulness, 
I am able to speak now. I want him to 
know I very much appreciate that. 

f 


PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, tomorrow 
I intend to introduce bipartisan 
prescription drug legislation with 
the senior Republican on the Senate 
Finance Committee’s Subcommittee on 
Health, Ms. OLYMPIA SNOWE of Maine. 
For more than 3 years, Senator SNOWE 
and I have teamed up in an effort to address 
this prescription drug issue, of 
which the Presiding Officer is acutely 
aware. It is one of the most vexing and 
contentious of all issues. We have been 
trying to address it in a bipartisan 
fashion. Perhaps no issue in the last 
political campaign generated more 
controversy, more attack ads on both 
sides, and more bitterness rather than 
thoughtful discussion than the question 
of prescription drugs for seniors. 
The reason Senator SNOWE and I are 
moving now with the introduction of 
our bipartisan legislation tomorrow is 
that we are hopeful that when the Senate 
Finance Committee takes up the 
prescription drug legislation issue at 
this month, the legislation we have put 
together can serve as a template, a beginning, 
for a bipartisan effort to address 
this issue. 
Our legislation marries what I think 
are the core principles that Democratic 
Members of this body have advocated 
with certain key principles that Republicans 
have felt very strongly about as 
well. I want to discuss briefly tonight 
how our legislation does that. 
The legislation that I drafted with 
Senator SNOWE, for example, has a defined 
benefit, which is absolutely key 
for the Nation’s senior citizens. The alternative 
is what is known as a defined 
contribution—a sort of a voucher 
which you hand an older person, or a 
family with sort of a wish and a hope 
that maybe they will get meaningful 
benefits. 
What Senator SNOWE and I have 
done—which has been extraordinarily 
important to Senator DASCHLE, and 
correctly so, in my view—is to make 
sure that under our legislation every 
senior would get these defined benefits. 

Second, our legislation ensures that 
the program is inside the Medicare 
Program. It is a part of the Medicare 
Program because, as the Presiding Officer 
of the Senate knows, the alternative 
is to in effect begin the privatization 
of Medicare and the prescription 
drug benefit. It is essential that 
this program be an integral part of 
Medicare. That is something that Senator 
SNOWE and I have felt very strongly 
about. 

The third part of the legislation ensures 
that older people will have bargaining 
power to help make prescription 
drugs in this country more affordable. 
Older people today are in effect 
hit by a double whammy. Prescription 
drugs are not covered by the Medicare 
Program, of course, and they haven’t 
been since the program began in 1965. 

When an older person isn’t able to afford 
prescription drugs and has no private 
coverage, when they go to a pharmacy—
in effect that senior citizen is 
subsidizing the person who gets their 
prescription drugs through a group 
plan. An individual who is fortunate 
enough to have bargaining power because 
they have insurance coverage, in 
effect is subsidized by the older person 
who has no coverage at all. 

Our legislation ensures that older 
people would have an opportunity to 
have real bargaining power. This is key 
for the millions of older people who 
spend well over a third of their income 
on prescription drugs. 

Finally, our legislation is voluntary. 
We want to make sure that the message 
goes out far and wide that any 
older person who is comfortable with 
their prescription drug coverage today 
can just keep it and in no way would be 
required or coerced to alter the prescription 
drug coverage with which 
they are comfortable. If they have a retirement 
package, or in some way get 
this assistance, our legislation would 
not in any way alter what they are receiving. 


Having had the privilege of working 
with the Presiding Officer on health 
care legislation over the years, I am 
pleased that I have a chance tonight to 
describe our bipartisan bill with you in 
the Chair. 

I think we all understand that there 
is no one who has studied the health 
care system today—not a Democrat or 
a Republican—if they were redesigning 
Medicare, who wouldn’t include a prescription 
drug benefit. 

A physician in Washington County in 
my home State of Oregon wrote me not 
long ago saying that he put a senior 
citizen in the hospital for 6 weeks because 
that person couldn’t afford their 
medicine on an outpatient basis. Medicare 
Part A, of course—the hospital 
portion of the Medicare Program—covers 
prescription drugs. If the older person 
goes into the hospital, Medicare 
Part A will write out that check, no 
questions asked. Medicare Part B, of 
course, has no outpatient prescription 
drug benefit. 

What happened in Washington County, 
in my home State of Oregon, re


cently is that the Medicare Program 
probably paid out $50,000 or $60,000 for 
the costs associated with hospitalizing 
a patient to get prescription drug coverage 
rather than making this benefit 
available on an outpatient basis the 
way I and Senator SNOWE and the Presiding 
Officer have sought to do for so 
many years. 

Very often, when I am out around the 
country, people come up to me. They 
say: RON, can this country afford prescription 
drug coverage? We are going 
to have this demographic sunami. Are 
we going to be able to afford to cover 
all of these older people? 

I think what we have learned here is 
that very clearly this country can’t afford 
not to cover prescription drugs. 
We can’t afford to allow the repetition 
of what happened in Washington County 
in Oregon and across this country 
where so many older people could have, 
with modest prescription drug assistance, 
prevented much more serious illnesses. 
And I could cite one drug after 
another tonight. 

Strokes are a very important health 
concern for older people. The cost of 
caring for a person who has had a 
stroke can be $125,000 or $150,000. But 
we have many drugs available that 
help prevent strokes that cost $800 or 
$1,000 a year. 

So the hour is late, and I am not 
going to go through one example after 
another. But I would say, what Senator 
SNOWE and I are trying to do is break 
the gridlock on this issue. I have been 
at it for more than 3 years now with 
Senator SNOWE. We got a majority of 
the Senate, in the last Congress, to 
vote for funding a prescription drug 
program that, frankly, is much broader 
than what we are talking about now. 
Senator SNOWE and I were able to get 
over 50 Members of the Senate to vote 
for a tobacco tax to cover a prescription 
drug program. 

We are not talking about that at all 
here. In the budget resolution we have 
$300 billion to start a prescription drug 
program. I believe a properly designed 
prescription drug program would cause 
future Congresses to make available 
additional funds to meet this pressing 
need. The challenge today is to look at 
some of the sensible ideas that Senator 
DASCHLE, the majority leader, has advocated, 
such as a defined benefit, ensuring 
that the program is inside Medicare, 
providing bargaining power for 
older people, and marrying the sensible 
ideas Senator DASCHLE has talked 
about with some of the Republican 
ideas that promote choice and competition. 


As I have said to my colleagues on 
other occasions, we have a precedent 
for doing that. One of the accomplishments 
of which I am proudest is to 
have been the sponsor, when I was in 
the House of Representatives, of the 
Medigap legislation which really 
drained the swamp of so many questionable 
private insurers selling senior 
citizens policies that really were not 
worth the paper on which they were 
written. 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7719 

I remember back in the days when I 
was Co-director of the Oregon Gray 
Panthers, we would visit seniors and 
they would have a shoe box full of 
these policies. They would have seven 
or eight private policies. They, in effect, 
were wasting money on junk that 
could have been used to meet their 
heating bills or their other health 
needs. We drained that swamp, and we 
did it through a Medigap law, by ensuring 
that seniors had meaningful 
choices and strong consumer protections. 


So we have an example of how you 
can create choice and alternatives and 
promote competition, and do it in the 
context of the Medicare Program. You 
do not have to go out and privatize this 
program that has been a lifeline for 
millions of older people in order to create 
choice and competition. You can do 
it within the Medicare Program, which 
is what I am seeking to do with the 
senior Senator from Maine, the ranking 
Republican on the Finance Subcommittee 
on Health Care, Ms. OLYMPIA 
SNOWE. 

Our hope is that when the Senate Finance 
Committee gets together this 
month, on a bipartisan basis, they will 
look at our legislation, along with the 
other very good bills that have been in


troduced. The senior Senator from 
Florida, Mr. GRAHAM, for example, has 
talked at length with me about this 
issue and has a fine bill. I think there 
are a variety of ways the Senate Finance 
Committee, under the leadership 
of Senator BAUCUS, can take these bills 
and bring the Finance Committee 
Democrats and Republicans together 
and break this gridlock on a vital 
issue. 

I know of few issues that are more 
important at this point to American 
families than prescription drugs. I 
think we all understand that with a 
well crafted prescription drug program, 
this country can take a significant step 
forward towards meaningful Medicare 
reform. 

I say to the Presiding Officer, the 
hour is late, and you have been gracious 
to allow me, along with the 
Democratic leader, this extra time. I 
intend to keep coming back to this 
Chamber again and again and again 
throughout this Congress to, in effect, 
proselytize—I use that word deliberately—
with my colleague from 
Maine, Senator SNOWE, for a bipartisan 
effort on this issue. It has dragged on 
too long. There has been too much partisan 
bickering and squabbling surrounding 
this issue. 

I would like to see just a tiny fraction 
of the millions of dollars that were 
spent on attack ads during the last political 
campaign on this issue spent on 
trying to bring Democrats and Republicans—
Members of Congress across the 
political spectrum —together on this 
issue. That is what older people deserve. 


Every month that this issue drags on 
is a month where older people—who are 
walking an economic tightrope, having 
to balance their fuel needs against 
their medical needs—have to worry 
about how they are going to pay for 
their essentials. The Presiding Officer 
understands that very well. I look forward 
to working with her and all of our 
colleagues on a bipartisan basis. 

With that, Madam President, I yield 
the floor.

AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, 
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, 
AND RELATED 
AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS 
ACT, 2002 

SPEECH OF 

HON. SAXBY CHAMBLISS 

OF GEORGIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Thursday, July 12, 2001 

The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the State of the Union had under 
consideration the bill (H.R. 2330) making appropriations 
for Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies programs for the fiscal 
year ending September 30, 2002, and for other 
purposes: 

Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. Chairman, I fully support 
H.R. 2330, because it provides funding 
for programs that will help assure the vitality of 
agriculture in America and particularly in Georgia. 
This bill allocates funding for essential 
programs, which allow further development 
and progress in food production. In addition, 

H.R. 2330 provides financial support for agricultural 
research that is crucial for finding solutions 
that will allow and promote more cost-effective 
production methods and higher quality 
results. 
By allocating funding for research, this bill 
will help resolve problems inhibiting productivity 
and development. More specifically, research 
in pest and disease control, such as 
nematode and tomato spotted wilt disease research 
will enhance strategies used to combat 
crop yield losses. Also, funding is included for 
the development of more efficient agricultural 
water usage that is critical to locations in 
south Georgia where agricultural water usage 
comprises 50% of all water consumed. Furthermore, 
the bill includes funding for the improvement 
of cotton fiber quality. Funding is 
necessary for purchasing equipment that 
would be used in developing a research cotton 
micro gin for evaluation of cotton fiber in Georgia. 
Also, funding for pecan scab research is 
important to explore diseases that limit and inhibit 
pecan production. 

Support for these research efforts, coupled 
with funding for promotional and marketing efforts, 
will help enable farmers to practice more 
efficient methods and minimize the devastating 
losses with which they have become 
all too familiar. I urge my colleagues to vote 
for this bill and support American Agriculture.

TRIBUTE TO RUTH HYMAN 

HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Monday, July 16, 2001 

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
call the attention of Congress to an event on 
Thursday, August 16 in New Jersey. The Jew


ish Family and Children’s Service of Greater 
Monmouth County is holding a dinner and tribute 
at Temple Beth El of Oakhurst to honor 
Ruth Hyman. Ruth will have the distinction of 
receiving an Ad Journal for her work as a philanthropist 
and her support of Jewish causes 
in the area, as well as in Israel. 

Ruth, close friend of mine, was born in my 
hometown of Long Branch, New Jersey into a 
family of four boys and four girls. She says 
that her parents’ direction and teachings of 
tzedakah, menschlichkeit, and the Torah guided 
her to be the person that she is today. 

Ruth’s teachings as a child can well be 
seen in her community involvement. She is a 
life member of Daughters of Miriam, charter 
and life member of the Central Jersey Jewish 
Home for the Aged, founder and past chairperson 
of the Federation Women’s Business 
and Professional Division, benefactor and 
board member of the Jewish Community Center, 
and an active member of B’nai Brith, 
AMIT, and Congregation Brothers of Israel. 
For the past twenty-five years Ms. Hyman has 
been the Chairperson of the Women’s Division 
of Israel Bonds, and for the past twenty-six 
years she has been the president of the Long 
Branch Hadassah. 

This is not the first time that Ruth will be 
honored for her service to the community. 
Ruth has received the Service Award from the 
Jewish Federation Women’s Campaign, 
Woman of Valor of the Long Branch chapter 
of Hadassah, Israel Bonds Golda Meir Award 
and the Ben Gurion Award, Lay Leader of the 
Year by the Jewish Federation, and the Hadassah 
National Leadership Award. The community 
cannot express the debt that we owe 
to my friend Ruth who has shown us all that 
selflessness will never go unrecognized. 

I want to personally thank Ruth Hyman for 
being a leader of the Jewish community and 
an excellent role model for our youth.

CONGRATULATIONS TO SERGEANT 
HAROLD F. ADKISON CHAPTER 
OF THE KOREAN WAR VETERANS 
ASSOCIATION UPON RECEIVING 
THEIR FORMAL CHARTER 

HON. LINDSEY O. GRAHAM 

OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Monday, July 16, 2001 

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the Sergeant Harold F. Adkison 
Chapter of the Korean War Veterans Association 
for recently receiving their formal charter. 
On June 25, 2001, as a result of their tireless 
efforts, this chapter was officially established. 

This chapter had fifty charter members before 
its petition for a charter was submitted, an 
unprecedented show of commitment. For this, 
the Sergeant Harold F. Adkison Chapter 
should certainly be commended. 

America’s Armed Forces are exceptional, 
because unlike other nations our military not

only defends the homeland and our people, 
but we protect the freedom of all men. In 
World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, 
and in the Desert Storm our men and women 
have gone to fight for freedom. 

The Korean War, regrettably, has often 
been referred to as the ‘‘forgotten war’’ because 
it came so quickly after World War II 
and was overshadowed on the homefront by 
the Vietnam War and its associated protests. 
At the outbreak of hostilities, many feared that 
this tiny peninsula would be the setting for the 
eruption of World War III as the United Nations 
joined with the United States and the Republic 
of South Korea to stop the invasion of 
the North Koreans backed by both the Soviet 
Union and the People’s Republic of China. 

The great sacrifice to the world made by the 
members of this newly established chapter of 
the Korean War Veterans Association, and 
their more than 54,000 peers, was a huge gift 
to the cause of freedom. As the Korean War 
Veterans Memorial on the Mall reads: ‘‘Our 
nation honors her sons and daughters who 
answered the call to defend a country they 
never knew and a people they never met.’’ 

The charter members of this new chapter 
should be proud of their sacrifices to defend 
freedom. Many of them lost friends to the horrors 
of combat. Their lives were changed in 
ways that no one can imagine, but they also 
changed the world in ways that we all can 
clearly see. 

I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating 
these veterans on the establishment of 
the Sergeant Harold F. Adkison Chapter and 
in thanking them for their outstanding service 
to our nation. We owe them a tremendous

OF GEORGIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Monday, July 16, 2001 

Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to Senator Hugh Marion Gillis, 
Sr. for his dedicated service to his country and 
to the state of Georgia. This year Senator 
Gillis his attained a distinction achieved by no 
other member of the Georgia House or the 
Senate and only one other state legislator in 
the nation by completing 50 years of service 
in the Georgia General Assembly. 

Senator Gillis comes from a proud family 
tradition of public service. Without opposition 
he won the Senate seat that his father left and 
was then elected President Pro Tem, a seat 
his father too held. Senator Gillis served 12 
years as a member of the House of Representatives 
from 1941–44, and again from 
1949–56, and he first served in the Senate 
from the 16th District in 1957–58 and returned 
as the Senator from the 20th in 1963, where 
he has served with dedication and diligence 
for 38 consecutive years. 

Gillis was born in Soperton where he graduated 
from Soperton High School and then 
went on to study at Georgia Military College 
and earn a B.S. degree in agriculture from the 
University of Georgia. 

It has been said that ‘‘Nearly all men can 
stand adversity, but if you want to test a man’s 
character, give him power.’’ 

Senator Gillis has stood up to the challenge 
of leadership and power with wisdom and humility 
to be one of the most respected politicians 
of Georgia. 

He has served in the General Assembly 
longer than any other Senator currently in office. 
Senator Gillis is by all accounts the nation’s 
longest-serving legislator. His combined 
Senate and House terms exceed 50 years. In 
his years of service, Senator Gillis has served 
as the Chairman of the Senate Natural Resources 
Committee and a member of the influential 
Appropriations Committee. Other committees 
Senator Gillis has served on are the 
Reapportionment Committee and the Finance 
and Public Utilities Committee as well as the 
Economic Development, Tourism and Cultural 
Affairs Committee. He has also served for six 
years as the Senate President Pro-Tempore, 
the highest-ranking Senate official next to the 
Lieutenant Governor. 

Senator Gillis is known for his legislative 
work and also for his civic volunteering and 
community service. Senator Gillis has received 
numerous awards for his civic work, such as 
the title of Treutlen County Citizen of the year. 
Senator Gillis has served on the boards of Private 
Colleges, The Georgia Poultry Federation, 
Georgia Forestry Association, and Future 
Farmers of America. 

Senator Gillis is also a deacon at Soperton 
First Baptist Church and a member of the 

Lion’s Club. He has served as chairman of the 
Treutlen County Hospital Authority for 22 
years. 

Senator Gillis, a widower is the father of two 
sons, Hugh Jr. and Donald; and a daughter, 
Jean Marie. By profession, he is a farmer and 
timber grower. 

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to call to the attention 
of the House of Representatives the 
many accomplishments that have followed in 
the path of Senator Gillis’ career. I am privileged 
to know such a dedicated and upstanding 
citizen and to call him my good friend. I 
thank him for his efforts to improve the lives 
of so many others across Georgia.

Fort Monmouth in New Jersey.

TRIBUTE TO CALIFORNIA’S SEN


IOR SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, 

THE LATE STANLEY MOSK 

HON. ROBERT T. MATSUI 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Monday, July 16, 2001 

Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to California’s Senior Supreme 
Court Justice, the late Stanley Mosk. 

For the past 37 years, Mosk served as the 
court’s independent voice and moral compass. 
His trailblazing decisions brought sweeping 
changes to California law long before such decisions 
were addressed at the national level. A 
vigorous advocate of individual liberties, Mosk 
lead state courts across the country to use 
their own constitutions to establish individual 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1335 

rights beyond those required under the federal 
constitution. In 1976, Mosk wrote the opinion 
that bars the use of improperly obtained confessions 
arguing that such confessions could 
not be used to challenge the truthfulness of a 
defendant who later testifies. While the U.S. 
Supreme Court allowed for such use, Mosk invoked 
the state Constitution and did not approve 
the practice. His always careful, 
thoughtful and considerate opinions, totaling 
1,688 over the span of his career, were widely 
regarded and highly acclaimed. 

Mosk, the longest-serving member in the 
court’s 151–year history and only Democrat, 
was known for his shrewd political acumen 
and often criticized by his adversaries for his 
focused attention of the states shifting political 
climate. Nevertheless, Mosk remained dedicated 
to his role as a public servant and vigilant 
in his undertaking of civil and criminal law. 

A native of San Antonio, Mosk’s career as 
a giant in the court began by serving 15 years 
on the Superior Court and six years as the 
State Attorney General. For a time, he served 
as the Democratic national committeeman 
from California but became weary of the fundraising 
component attached to political life and 
returned to the judicial branch as a member of 
the state Supreme Court. 

While Mosk’s independent liberal voice will 
be missed, the legacy that he has left will continue 
to serve the people of California.

TRIBUTE TO 1107TH AVIATION 

CLASSIFICATION AND REPAIR 

ACTIVITIES DEPOT 

HON. IKE SKELTON 

OF MISSOURI 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Monday, July 16, 2001 

Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, let me take 
this means to praise the Missouri National 
Guard for the integral role that they are playing 
in keeping the Army’s Apache helicopters 
in the air. The 1107th Aviation Classification 
and Repair Activities Depot, or the MO– 
AVCRAD, has been the only National Guard 
group selected to help with this mission. 

Recently, an AH–64 Apache lost a tail rotor 
blade and then the entire tail rotor hub assembly. 
The good news is the skilled pilots were 
able to land the helicopter, the bad news is 
that the cause of the accident is not know. 
When these accidents happen, several agencies 
attempt to find out what happened and 
why. As a precautionary measure a Safety of 
Flight is issued, mandating that all tail rotor 
blades be inspected. 

This inspection is crucial to ensure that our 
soldiers are as safe as possible and the MOAVCRAD 
is making that happen. The MO– 
AVCRAD is helping to inspect every tail rotor 
blade, including those in storage bins. 

Mr. Speaker, the soldiers responsible for 
this critical work deserve to be recognized. I 
know the Members of the House will join me 
in extending a big thank you to the soldiers of 
the 1107th Aviation Classification and Repair 
Activities Depot.

intelligence, responsible citizenship, and capacity

Lakeview High School and possesses an impressive 
high school record. Travis’s involvement 
in both the Lakeview High School and 
the Battle Creek Math and Science Center

PAYING TRIBUTE TO SHERIFF 
CULLEN TALTON 

HON. SAXBY CHAMBLISS 

OF GEORGIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Monday, July 16, 2001 

Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to Sheriff Cullen Talton of Houston 
County. His dedication to the people of his 
county is deserving of the utmost recognition. 

Sheriff Talton being one of the most respected 
sheriffs in the state, became a recipient 
of the Liberty Bell Award on June 11, 
2001. This esteemed award is given by Bar 
Associations across the United States to recognize 
special people in their communities. 
The award praises the achievements of contributions 
that exceed the work of the common 
man. The Houston County Bar Association 
presents the Liberty Bell Award each year to 
celebrate the work of someone who has contributed 
to our legal system beyond the significant 
call of duty. The recipient of this award is 
generally someone who has dedicated his 
life’s work to better the legal system in hopes 
of making his community a better place for 
those who are to follow. 

Sheriff Cullen Talton has lived in Bonaire, 
Georgia, his whole life. Sheriff Talton has 
served 29 years as Sheriff of Houston County 
and 6 years as County Commissioner. While 
serving his community as a law enforcement 
officer he has also maintained a personal life 
that deems recognition as well. Sheriff Talton 
married his high school sweetheart, Peggy 
Sears and they have been married for 51 
years. Together they have raised four children, 
Carline, Pattie, Cully and Neal. There are also 
four grandchildren and one great-grandchild. 
Keeping his faith as the focal point of his life 
he has been a life long member of Bonaire 
United Methodist Church. 

Sheriff Talton is a member of many civic organizations 
and has received an abundance of 
awards for his civic work over the past 35 
years. Sheriff Talton is a member of the Georgia 
Sheriffs Association and the National Sheriff’s 
Association. His pet project is serving on 
the Board of the Georgia Sheriffs Boy’s Ranch 
in Hahira. This Boy’s Ranch is a place where 
underprivileged children can have a home. 
Sheriff Talton has been honored as Georgia’s 
Sheriff of the Year and has received the Warner 
Robins/Houston County Chamber of Commerce 
Good Government Service Award. He 
serves as a board member of the State of 
Georgia Department of Corrections and is 
Chairman of the Board of Security Bank in 
Houston County. 

Sheriff Talton is a successful leader because 
he believes that the way to take care of 
the people is to know the people. He has 
maintained a respected Sheriff’s Department 
because he maintains his open door policy to 
the citizens. This keeps him close to the community 
making him aware of its problems as 
well as its victories. The Liberty Bell Award 
speak volumes for the work that Sheriff Talton 
has done. He is greatly appreciated. If it were 
not for the dedication of people like Sheriff 
Cullen Talton our counties, states and country 
could not march forward. 

Mr. Speaker, Sheriff Cullen Talton has devoted 
his life to better serving his community. 
He spends tireless energy towards bettering 
his community and for that Sheriff Cullen 
Talton deserves our recognition and gratitude 
today.

TRIBUTE TO HARRY LEE COE III 

HON. JIM DAVIS 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Monday, July 16, 2001 

Mr. DAVIS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today I 
would like to pay tribute to Harry Lee Coe III, 
a loving father, gifted athlete, dedicated judge 
and life-long public servant of the citizens of 
Florida. Harry passed away one year ago. 

Harry was first known in Hillsborough County 
as a pitcher for the Tampa Tarpons, but he 
soon built a distinguished law career, serving 
as a civil lawyer, then as a juvenile court attorney 
and finally as a criminal court judge. Harry 
presided over his court for 20 years—always 
devoted to serving our community to the best 
of his ability. 

On the bench, Harry was known not only for 
his unique wit and passion, but also for his unwavering 
integrity and commitment to justice. 
Some say Harry expected too much of those 
who came before his bench, but he always 
demanded the most of himself and worked 
tirelessly to do his best. While Harry became 
known as ‘‘Hanging Harry’’ for his stringent 
sentences and his deep conviction to protecting 
our community from dangerous criminals, 
he was equally passionate about giving 
our children the love and support they deserve 
to prevent the need for such rehabilitation. 

Much can be said of Harry’s dedication to 
his job, but volumes can be written of his persona 
outside the court. In all of Harry’s years 
as an elected official he was never branded as 
a typical politician, for his kind and gentle demeanor 
with people could never be mistaken 
for anything other than sincerity. You could always 
depend on Harry to listen to what you 
had to say, just as much as you knew that his 
words were from the heart. I know Harry will 
be remembered for all these things.

SMALL BUSINESS REFINERS COMPLIANCE 
WITH THE HIGHWAY 
DIESEL FUEL SULFUR CONTROL 
REQUIREMENTS 

HON. STEPHEN HORN 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Monday, July 16, 2001 

Mr. HORN. Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of 
this year, on January 18, 2001, the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) implemented 
heavy-duty engine and vehicle standards and 
highway diesel fuel sulfur control requirements. 
I strongly supported the final rule by 
the EPA as a necessary tool to reduce pollution. 
Under this new regulation, oil refiners 
must meet rigorous new standards to reduce 
the sulfur content of highway diesel fuel from 
its current level of 500 parts per million to 15 
parts per million by June, 2006. The diesel 
rule goes a long way in reducing the amount 
of pollution in our air. 


July 16, 2001 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1337 

Small business refineries produce a full 
slate of petroleum products including everything 
from gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel to asphalt, 
lube oil, and specialty petroleum products. 
Today, among the 124 refineries operating 
in the United States, approximately 25 
percent are small, independent refiners. These 
small business refiners contribute to the nation’s 
energy supply by manufacturing specific 
products like grade 80-aviation fuel, JP–4 jet 
fuel, and off-road diesel fuel. 

In order for oil refineries to comply with the 
new rule, the EPA estimated capital costs at 
an average of $14 million per refinery. This is 
a relatively small cost for major multinational 
oil companies, but for smaller refineries, this is 
a very high capital cost that is virtually impossible 
to undertake without substantial assistance. 
Small business refiners presented information 
in support of this position to EPA during 
the rulemaking process. In fact, EPA 
agreed that small business refiners would likely 
experience a significant and disproportionate 
financial hardship in reaching the objectives 
of the diesel fuel sulfur rule. 

There is currently no provision that helps 
small business refiners meet the objectives of 
the rule. That is why I am introducing a tax incentive 
proposal that would provide the specific, 
targeted assistance that small refineries 
need to achieve better air quality and provide 
complete compliance with EPA’s rule. 

A qualified small business refiner—defined 
as refiners with fewer than 1,500 employees 
and less than a total capacity of 155,000 barrels 
per day—will be eligible to receive federal 
assistance of up to 35 percent of the costs 
necessary, through tax credits, to comply with 
the Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements 
of the EPA. 

Without such a provision, many small business 
refiners will be unable to comply with the 
EPA rule and could be forced out of the market. 
Individually, each small refiner represents 
a small share of the national petroleum marketplace. 
Cumulatively, however, the impact is 
substantial. Small business refiners produce 
about four percent of the nation’s diesel fuel 
and in some regions, provide over half of the 
diesel fuel. Small business refiners also fill a 
critical national security function. For example, 
in 1998 and 1999, small business refiners provided 
almost 20 percent of the jet fuel used by 

U.S. military bases. Small business refiners’ 
pricing competition pressures the larger, integrated 
companies to lower prices for the consuming 
public. Without that competitive pressure, 
consumers will certainly pay higher 
prices for the same products. 
Over the past decade, approximately 25 

U.S. refineries have shut down. Without assistance 
in complying with the EPA rule, we 
may loose another 25 percent of U.S. refineries. 
This legislation is critical—not because 
small business refiners do not want to comply 
with the EPA rule due to differences in environmental 
policy—but because it will help 
keep small business refiners as an integral 
part of the industry and on their way to cleaner 
production and full compliance with all environmental 
regulations. 

MEDAL OF HONOR, ED FREEMAN 

HON. C.L. ‘‘BUTCH’’ OTTER 

OF IDAHO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Monday, July 16, 2001 

Mr. OTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor one of Idaho’s great citizens. Ed Freeman, 
73, of Boise, who will be awarded the 
Medal of Honor today by the President for his 
acts of valor during the Vietnam War. The 
Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor 
in action against an enemy force which can be 
bestowed upon an individual serving in the 
Armed Services of the United States. 

On November 14th, 1965, Captain Freeman 
risked his life more than once to deliver ammunition 
and supplies to 450 men who had 
been surrounded by more than 2,000 North 
Vietnamese. In addition, each time he delivered 
supplies, he carried out wounded U.S. 
military personnel to safety. 

On November 14th, 1965, Captain Freeman 
voluntarily flew his Army Helicopter on 14 missions 
to the Ia Dang battle zone in less than 
14 hours. For each trip, he risked his life to 
save and supply his fellow countrymen. 

Without the courage of Captain Freeman 
and his crew, the 450 men in the Ia Dang Valley 
would have been quickly overrun by the 
North Vietnamese. By the end of the day Captain 
Freeman had saved an estimated 30 soldiers. 


Mr. Speaker I am pleased to salute Captain 
Freeman today for his act of bravery in 1965 
and I congratulate him for receiving the highest 
military honor anyone can receive, the 
Medal of Honor.

NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT AND 

ECONOMIC CONVERSION ACT OF 

2001 

HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 

OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Monday, July 16, 2001 

Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I have introduced 
the Nuclear Disarmament and Economic 
Conversion Act every year since 1993, 
and I will continue to introduce this bill until 
the threat posed by the world’s nuclear arsenals 
is eliminated. This issue was brought to 
my attention by constituents who have been 
vigilant to the continuing need to focus on nuclear 
proliferation. Moreover, today missile defense 
is being pressed by the Bush Administration, 
which has refused to acknowledge urgent 
domestic needs from health care to affordable 
housing. 

Long after the end of the Cold War and the 
breakup of the Soviet Union, the threat of nuclear 
weapons remains. Today, the United 
States continues to hold approximately 7,295 
operational nuclear warheads while Russia 
controls 6,094, and the other declared nuclear 
powers of Great Britain, France, and China 
are estimated to possess approximately 

10,000 operational warheads. Furthermore, 
proliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in 
countries in unstable regions, is now one of 
the leading military threats to the national security 
of the United States, its allies, and the 
world. 

The United States, as the sole remaining 
superpower and the leading nuclear power in 
the world, has an obligation to move first and 
take bold steps to encourage other nuclear 
powers to eliminate their arsenals and to prevent 
the proliferation of these weapons. That 
is why I have chosen today, the 56th anniversary 
of the first test of a nuclear explosive in 
Alamogordo, New Mexico, to reintroduce the 
Nuclear Disarmament and Economic Conversion 
Act of 2001. The bill would require the 
United States to disable and dismantle its nuclear 
weapons and to refrain from replacing 
them with weapons of mass destruction once 
foreign countries possessing nuclear weapons 
enact and execute similar requirements. 

My bill has an important complementary 
provision that the resources used to sustain 
our nuclear weapons program be used to address 
human and infrastructure needs such as 
housing, health care, education, agriculture, 
and the environment. By eliminating our nuclear 
weapons arsenal, the United States can 
realize an additional ‘‘peace dividend’’ from 
which critical domestic initiatives can be funded, 
including new programs proposed in the 
Administration’s FY 2002 budget. 

Many courageous leaders in the United 
States and around the world have spoken out 
about the obsolescence of nuclear weapons 
and the need for their elimination. These leaders 
include retired Air Force General Lee Butler 
and more than 60 other retired generals 
and admirals from 17 nations, who, on December 
5, 1996, issued a statement that ‘‘the 
continuing existence of nuclear weapons in 
the armories of nuclear powers, and the ever-
present threat of acquisition of these weapons 
by others, constitute a peril to global peace 
and security and to the safety and survival of 
the people we are dedicated to protect’’ and 
that the ‘‘creation of a nuclear-weapons-free 
world [is] necessary [and] possible.’’ 

The United States and the world community 
must redouble their efforts to obtain commitments 
from the nations developing nuclear 
technology to refrain from actual deployment 
of nuclear weapons, as well as to help contain 
other countries that aspire to become nuclear 
powers, such as Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, 
from moving forward with their programs. The 
United States will be far more credible and 
persuasive in these efforts if we are willing to 
take the initiative in dismantling our own nuclear 
weapons program and helping arms industries 
to convert plants and employees to 
providing products and services that enhance 
the wealth and quality of life of citizens. I ask 
my colleagues to cosponsor the Nuclear Disarmament 
and Economic Conversion Act of 
2001 and the committees with jurisdiction over 
the bill to mark it up quickly so that it can be 
considered and passed.

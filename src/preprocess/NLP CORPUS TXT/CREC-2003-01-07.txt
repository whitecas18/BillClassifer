H4 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

House on your swearing-in to the 108th 
Congress which is about to occur. A 
special congratulations and welcome to 
the freshmen to the Capitol and certainly 
to their families and friends. Let 
us all welcome our freshmen Members. 

Let me also thank my Democratic 
colleagues. I am humbled by the honor 
they have bestowed upon me to become 
the House Democratic leader. I know 
that I speak for all of us when I express 
profound gratitude to our esteemed 
colleague, the gentleman from Missouri 
(Mr. GEPHARDT). We thank the 
gentleman for his unwavering service 
to this institution and to our country. 
It is a great honor to follow in his footsteps. 


And to my family, my dear husband, 
Paul, our five children, and our five 
grandchildren, and to my D’Alesandro 
family, I thank them very much for the 
love, support, encouragement, and joy 
that they have given me. 

Because of you, and the people of San 
Francisco, whom I am honored to 
serve, I had the unprecedented privilege 
today to have my name placed in 
nomination as the first woman ever to 
do so in the history of the House of 
Representatives. 

I am grateful to my colleagues for 
the confidence and proud of my party 
for breaking down another barrier and 
leading America closer to the ideal of 
equality that is both our heritage and 
our hope. 

We serve in the people’s House; and 
today, I want to pay tribute to the 
American people. It is their greatness, 
their fair-mindedness, their commitment 
to family, their willingness to 
hope and dream that sustain our country. 


I especially wish to acknowledge the 
men and women in uniform whose 
courage keeps our country free and 
safe and makes it possible for us to 
strive for peace on Earth and goodwill 
toward mankind. 

For more than 214 years, the American 
people have issued a most awesome 
challenge to those of us in Congress. 
Debate, the American people tell 
us when they send us here, debate the 
great issues of our Nation. Decide matters 
of war and peace. Fashion laws and 
policies that will make our economy 
sound, our institutions fair, our society 
just, our environment protected, our 
people educated and healthy, our religions 
and beliefs free from constraint, 
and our homeland secure from terror. 

Debate policies, the American people 
tell us, which will ensure peace and 
justice throughout the world, comfort 
the afflicted, give voice to the oppressed, 
and make the future brighter 
for our children. 

Today I speak as the leader of the 
minority in a closely divided House of 
Representatives. We are on different 
sides of the aisle, but we have shared 
oath and a greater obligation to serve 
our country together, both to find common 
ground wherever we can and to 
stand our ground wherever we must to 
be true to the people we represent. 

My colleagues, I commit to all of you 
and to the American people that our 
party will always stand for the principles 
in which we believe, for I believe 
those principles represent the mainstream 
beliefs of our Nation: fairness, 
opportunity, patriotism, community, 
equal rights and a strong America, safe 
and prosperous at home, and committed 
abroad to a more secure and 
just world, free from the fear of terrorism. 


So in that spirit, I ask the majority 
in this House and the administration 
to join us in a new spirit to get our 
economy moving again in a way that 
helps working families. I ask that you 
join us in creating jobs and providing 
access to quality health care for America’s 
families, including a prescription 
drug coverage for our seniors. 

I ask that, after having passed the 
Leave No Child Behind Act, we act now 
to pledge to put our children first and 
fully fund their education. 

Finally and fundamentally, on the 
great and fateful issues we have all 
faced as Americans, especially since 
September 11, let me pledge for my 
party our absolute commitment to our 
national security, to winning the battle 
against terrorism and countering 
the threat of weapons of mass destruction. 


At times, we will have to debate on 
how best to provide for the common defense. 
That debate is not only right and 
necessary, it is at the heart of our democracy. 
But let there be no doubt, in 
our commitment to the strength and 
safety of America, there are no Democrats, 
there are no Republicans. Together, 
as Americans, we must and will 
prevail. 

We have great and grave issues to decide, 
as fateful as any faced by any of 
the 107 Congresses before us. So let us 
reach across party lines as we stand for 
principle, and let this be our own test, 
to advance and defend what is best for 
America. 

Now it is my privilege to present the 
Speaker of the House with my hardiest 
congratulations. Mr. Speaker, I hope in 
the next Congress our roles will be reversed, 
and you will have this wonderful 
privilege of presenting the gavel. 

In introducing our Speaker, let me 
first pay tribute to his skill, his decency 
and his integrity. We all hold the 
title of ‘‘honorable’’ by virtue of the office 
we hold; DENNIS HASTERT holds the 
title of ‘‘honorable’’ by virtue of his 
character. He is a man of honor. 

It is my privilege, colleagues, to 
present the Speaker of the House for 
the 108th Congress, the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. HASTERT). 

The SPEAKER. I want to thank the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PELOSI) for her gracious remarks, and I 
want to congratulate her for her historic 
achievement. NANCY PELOSI is the 
first woman in our Nation’s history to 
be nominated to be Speaker of the 
House of Representatives. Now that 
this glass ceiling has been broken, I 
trust she will not be the last. 

NANCY PELOSI is not the only woman 
to make history today. The gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. PRYCE) today 
becomes the first woman to chair the 
House Republican Conference. I want 
to congratulate her as well. 

I think it is altogether appropriate to 
note the history these two outstanding 
representatives have made today. We 
are a better country because of the active 
political participation of millions 
of American women, in this House and 
in elected positions all across this Nation. 


We have 63 women Members in the 
House today. They represent millions 
of American. They fight hard for their 
constituents, and they serve with distinction. 


Let me say to my good friend, the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PELOSI), as I welcome her to her new 
post as minority leader, we are going 
to have our fair share of disagreements. 
That is the nature of our two-
party system. But together we must always 
find ways to make America a better 
and a more secure place to live. 

My door will always be open as we 
work together in this 108th Congress. 
To all Members of this House, I say 
thank you for giving me the great 
honor to serve once again as your 
Speaker. 

As we stand here today, we leave behind 
the work of the historic 107th 
Congress. Some of the achievements of 
the 107th Congress were planned, others 
were thrust upon us by events. We 
enacted landmark education reform, 
far-reaching election reform, and we 
have completed work on the most significant 
tax relief in a generation. 

But we are also confronted by the 
most brutal, the senseless, and most 
tragic attack on our citizens in our Nation’s 
history. The events of September 
11, 2001, which we recalled in a historic 
commemorative session in New York 
City last fall, are still very much in 
our thoughts and in our prayers. 

We ache for those we lost at the 
World Trade Towers and the Pentagon, 
and we give quiet thanks to those 
brave passengers on United Flight 93 
who stopped the terrorists from crashing 
another plane into Washington, 

D.C. We sit in this Chamber knowing 
that it may very well have been the 
target for that ill-fated flight. 
Just a few steps from here, on the 
central steps of this Capitol building, 
we stood together on September 11, Republicans 
and Democrats. We stood 
shoulder to shoulder representing one 
Nation, under God, indivisible, and 
pledged to fight those who would 
threaten our freedom. 

b1400 
In this room, just a few days later, 
our President called us to action. And 
act we did to give the President the 
tools he needed to fight those who engage 
in terrorism and those who harbor 
them. 
Friends, our fellow Americans know 
that we are still engaged in that struggle 
today. Like generations before, 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5 

they know that freedom comes with a 
price. As we begin this new Congress, I 
want to say to the American people, we 
will keep that commitment we made 
on the steps of this Capitol on September 
11, 2001. This Congress will do 
everything in its power to provide for 
the security of the American people. 
We are determined that it shall never 
happen here again. 

The Members of this House who are 
returning can be proud of the legislation 
we passed to create a Department 
of Homeland Security, the most significant 
restructuring of the Federal 
Government in the last 50 years. It will 
help make this Nation more secure. 

But the 108th Congress must build on 
the work of the last Congress. Having 
given birth to this new department, we 
must now nurture it and, with the leadership 
of our President, guide it to successful 
maturity. And as we build on 
the achievements of the 107th Congress, 
we must not forget the legacy of 
three leaders, two who decided to make 
the 107th Congress their last, and another 
who chose to step down from his 
leadership post as he considers other 
opportunities for public service. 

Dick Armey and DICK GEPHARDT differed 
in many ways. The former majority 
leader and the former minority 
leader were often at odds on tax policy, 
debated vigorously on social policy, 
and presented competing visions for 
America. But they both loved this 
House, and they both loved the St. 
Louis Rams. Their leadership, along 
with that of J.C. Watts, will be missed 
in this House, and I wish them the best 
in their new endeavors. 

As we start the 108th Congress, we 
welcome 54 new Members of the House. 
I have had a chance to meet almost all 
of them, and I am impressed by their 
experience, by their expertise and by 
their energy. The other body also welcomes 
10 new Senators, including several 
of our former colleagues. 

As I begin my third term as Speaker 
of the House, and ninth term as a Member 
of Congress representing the voters 
of the 14th District of Illinois, I want 
to thank my constituents for honoring 
me with their trust. My district 
stretches from the far suburbs of Chicago, 
through the Fox River Valley, to 
the great Mississippi River. It includes 
suburbs, small towns and flowing fields 
of corn and soybeans. It is the heartland 
of America. I am particularly 
proud that it includes Dixon, Illinois, 
the boyhood home of one of the giants 
of the 20th century, President Ronald 
Reagan. 

As you all know, I go home as often 
as possible, because it is there that I 
get a dose of reality. It is usually my 
wife Jean who provides that dose of reality. 
Thank you, Jean, for all of your 
love, your support and your patience. 

I believe that to be a good Speaker of 
the House, you also must be a good listener. 
I pledge to you that I will continue 
to open my door to listen to your 
concerns and to do my best to do the 
will of this House. And as we start the 

108th Congress, we must all begin by 
listening to America, to the men and 
women who sent us here. 

What is it that concerns our citizens? 
First and foremost, they want us to 
make this Nation more secure. Terrorists 
threaten our American homeland. 
This Capitol building and the buildings 
where our fellow Americans work and 
live and worship are all on the front 
lines of this new war. Now that we have 
a Department of Homeland Security, 
we in the Congress have a duty to 
make sure it works as it was designed 
to work. It must protect our citizens 
without invading their privacy unnecessarily. 
It must make our government 
more effective in fighting terrorism 
without making our government too 
big. And it must do its work efficiently, 
without compromising workers’ 
rights. 

Later on today, we will vote to create 
a Select Committee on Homeland 
Security. Members of this select committee 
will oversee the creation of the 
Department of Homeland Security to 
make certain that the executive 
branch is carrying out the will of the 
Congress. This select committee will 
be our eyes and our ears as this critical 
department is organized. The standing 
committees of the House will maintain 
their jurisdictions and will still have 
authorization and oversight responsibilities. 
This House needs to adapt to 
the largest reorganization of our executive 
branch in 50 years, and this select 
committee will help us make this transition. 


As we protect our citizens, we must 
also support our Armed Forces as they 
fight the terrorists and the terrorist 
states that protect them. Giving our 
Armed Forces and intelligence services 
the resources they need to get the job 
done will be a top priority of this 
House. 

As we work to make American families 
more secure, we also need to improve 
our Nation’s economy. Without a 
sound economy that creates jobs, no 
family really feels secure. In too many 
pockets of our Nation, the economy 
stumbles along. This week, this House, 
as we did in the waning hours of the 
107th Congress, will address an immediate 
need by passing an extension of 
unemployment benefits. 

But we all know that unemployment 
benefits are no substitute for a permanent 
job. We must ask ourselves, what 
can we do to improve our economic 
growth and create jobs? First, we can 
lower the tax burden on small businesses 
so that they can hire more 
workers. Eighty percent of all the jobs 
in my district, and I suspect many of 
yours, are created by small and medium-
sized businesses. Let us do something 
to help the job creators. 

Second, we can increase export opportunities 
with the rest of the world. 
Last year we passed trade promotion 
authority. This year we need to promote 
more trade and, yes, fair trade. 

Third, we can cut the cost of government, 
of regulations, and of litigation, 

which too often strangles business creation 
and puts an undue burden on our 
consumers. 

Fourth, we can make the President’s 
tax cuts permanent. What sense does it 
make to phase out the unfair death tax 
over 8 years only to have it come back 
to life in year 9? And we have to look 
at longer term reform of our Tax Code. 
Our Tax Code should help us compete 
on the world stage. But does it help or 
actually hurt job creation? Would it 
not make sense to make our Tax Code 
simpler, smarter and less burdensome? 

As we work to make the economy 
stronger, we must also work to make 
our health care system better. We face 
a health care crisis in this country. 
Forty-four million Americans are uninsured. 
Prescription drug costs are too 
high. Health care costs continue to 
skyrocket. We need to address all of 
these issues, and we need to do it 
quickly. No senior citizen should be 
forced to choose between putting food 
on the table or purchasing lifesaving 
prescription drugs. No small business 
mom and pop operation should have to 
risk going without health insurance for 
their children because the cost is too 
high. No baby boomer should be forced 
to face bankruptcy just because she 
gets sick. Our health care system is the 
best in the world. But it could be even 
better and more accessible to everyone. 
We have the resources, we have the talent, 
and we have the know-how. Now 
let us have the right laws to allow for 
an even better system. 

Finally, last year we passed landmark 
education reform. The Leave No 
Child Behind Act was a good start to 
making our public schools the best in 
the world. But we still have much work 
to do. I taught at a public high school 
for 16 years. My wife taught public 
grade school for over 30 years. I know 
how tough, yet how rewarding teaching 
can be. There is no more noble profession 
than being a teacher. There is no 
better investment in the future of our 
Nation than education. Yet far too 
often our schools are not as good as 
they ought to be. Let us work together, 
as Republicans and Democrats, to improve 
our schools and support our 
teachers. 

On this historic day, my mind turns 
to our most sacred political document, 
our Constitution. It is here that we, 
the Congress of the United States, are 
charged with a simple task: establish 
justice, ensure domestic tranquility, 
provide for the common defense, promote 
the general welfare, and secure 
the blessings of liberty to ourselves 
and our posterity. Never has that mission 
seemed so important and never 
has it seemed to be more threatened. 

My colleagues, we have a sacred duty 
to perform. As the elected representatives 
of the American people, we must, 
along with our President, shoulder a 
great burden of responsibility. Today, 
we are jubilant in our celebration, and 
rightfully so. Enjoy this day with your 
family and your friends. But come back 
tomorrow with your sleeves rolled up, 


H6 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

because the task ahead is great and 
leadership is hard, steady work. You 
will be called upon to make many decisions 
over the next 2 years. Many will 
impact the economic well-being of your 
fellow Americans. Some may cause you 
to send our youth into harm’s way. 
There is no textbook for how to do 
your job. Each of you must find your 
own way. Start by doing your job to 
the best of your ability. Represent 
your constituents with the noblest of 
motives. And always be true to the 
democratic values of this great institution. 
Let us be respectful of those with 
whom we disagree and make an effort 
to find the common ground. Let us 
keep before us our common goal, to 
make this Nation safer and more secure 
for all Americans and a better 
place to pass on to our children and our 
grandchildren when our work here is 
done. 

As we begin this new 108th Congress, 
let us be mindful of our Creator and of 
His plans for this great country. May 
God bless this House of Representatives.

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

I want to begin by extending congratulations 
to the Speaker, our majority 
leader, our friends in the minority 
and all of our colleagues on their

January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H11 

The comprehensive changes that we 
are proposing in H. Res. 5 seek to build 
on the successful reform accomplishments 
of the last 8 years which have 
helped to make the House more accountable 
and deliberative and have 
strengthened our ability to govern effectively 
and responsibly. 

As my colleagues recall, Mr. Speaker, 
we overhauled the committee system, 
made Congress compliant with 
anti-discrimination and workplace 
safety laws, opened committee meetings 
to the public and press, modernized 
the Rules of the House to make 
them more understandable, and cut the 
number of standing rules nearly in 
half. In the 107th Congress, we created 
the Committee on Financial Services, 
enhanced oversight planning, strengthened 
performance goals and objectives, 
and created the Department of Homeland 
Security. 

Our continued investments in technology 
are transforming the culture, 
operations, and responsibilities of Congress 
in a very positive way. 

With that having been said, I want to 
describe some of the more significant 
positive rules changes we are proposing 
to the standing rules of the House, and 
those are contained in section 2 of this 
resolution. 

Section 2(A) and section 2(C), as well 
as section 2(L) stem from the recommendations 
made by the bipartisan 
Continuity of Congress Task Force, 
which was formed following the attack 
of September 11, 2001, which Speaker 
HASTERT talked about, that was co-
chaired by my friend, the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. FROST) and the gentleman 
from California (Mr. COX), and 
it reviewed the rules and procedures of 
the House to ensure that the appropriate 
institutional and mechanisms 
were in place to respond to a catastrophic 
event. 

The first provision amends rule 1, 
clause 8(b) to require the Speaker to 
provide to the Clerk of the House a list 
of Members in the order in which each 
shall act as Speaker pro tempore in the 
case of a vacancy in the office of 
Speaker. 

Section 2(C) provides new recess and 
convening authorities to the Speaker 
in the event of an imminent threat to 
the safety of the House by amending 
clause 12 of rule 1. 

Finally, Mr. Speaker, section 2(L) 
codifies the practice of adjusting the 
whole number of the House upon the 
death, resignation, expulsion, disqualification, 
or removal of a Member in 
rule 20, clause 5. 

In the 107th Congress, rule 18 was 
amended to allow the Chairman of the 
Committee of the Whole to postpone a 
request for a recorded vote on any 
amendment. This procedure has been 
very helpful, as my colleagues know, 
Mr. Speaker, in improving the management 
of the floor and in dealing with 
the challenges of our legislative schedule. 
In an effort to provide committees 
with similar management flexibility, 
section 2(G) proposes to amend rule 11, 

clause 2(h) to allow committees to 
adopt a similar rule authorizing the 
chairman of a committee or subcommittee 
to postpone certain votes 
and resume proceedings on a postponed 
question after reasonable notice. An 
underlying proposition would remain 
subject to further debate or amendment 
to the same extent as when the 
question was postponed. 

During the 105th Congress, Mr. 
Speaker, the House adopted H. Res. 168, 
which included both changes to the 
standing rules of the House and freestanding 
directives to the Committee 
on Standards of Official Conduct. For 
the past two Congresses, these freestanding 
directives have been carried 
forward through a separate order. 

Section 2(H) codifies these directives 
which address committee agenda, committee 
staff, meetings and hearings, 
public disclosure, requirements to constitute 
a complaint, duties of the 
chairman and ranking member, investigative 
and adjudicatory subcommittees, 
standard of proof for adoption of 
statement of alleged violation, subcommittee 
powers, due process rights 
of respondents, and committee reporting 
requirements. 

Section 2(I) permits the joint referral 
of measures without designation of primary 
jurisdiction. This change is 
meant only as a minor deviation from 
the normal requirement under the 
rules for the designation of one committee 
of primary jurisdiction and 
should be exercised only in extraordinary 
jurisdictionally deserving instances. 


Mr. Speaker, in an effort to provide 
more realistic estimates of tax measures, 
section 2(J) requires the Committee 
on Ways and Means to include 
in reports on measures amending the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 an analysis 
by the Joint Tax Committee on 
the macroeconomic impact of such legislation. 
This is something also known, 
Mr. Speaker, as dynamic scoring. 

Mr. Speaker, section 2(O) of the resolution 
expands the application of 
clause 5(a) of rule 21 to include as a tax 
or tariff measure a floor amendment 
limiting funds in a general appropriation 
bill for the administration of a tax 
or tariff. The intent of this rules 
change is to ease the burden on the 
maker of a point of order from having 
to show a necessary, certain and inevitable 
change in revenue collections, 
tax statuses, or liability as previous 
precedents required, to one of showing 
a textual relationship between the 
amendment and the administration of 
the Internal Revenue or tariff laws. 

The resolution amends clause 7(c)(1) 
of rule 22 to permit further motions to 
instruct during conference to be offered 
after 20 calendar days, but not 
less than 10 legislative days. While continuing 
to afford a Member a timely 
opportunity to offer a further motion 
to instruct, the modification in section 
2(P) provides a more realistic timetable, 
especially when a conference extends 
over a lengthy recess and is unable 
to meet. 

Section 2(T) creates a new rule 27 
which provides for the automatic 
House passage of a joint resolution increasing 
the statutory limit on the 
public debt when the House agrees to a 
budget resolution that requires such an 
increase. The amount of the increase in 
the joint resolution conforms to the 
level established in the budget resolution. 
The final House vote on the conference 
report on the budget resolution 
shall be deemed the vote on the joint 
resolution. The rule is similar to the 
former rule 23 of the 106th Congress 
and prior Congresses. 

The resolution also makes exceptions 
and clarifications to rule 25, also 
known as the gift rule, with regard to 
perishable food distributed in the office 
and charity travel, respectively. And, 
for the most part, the remaining provisions 
of section 2 are technical, conforming, 
or clarifying in nature. 

Mr. Speaker, section 3 of the resolution 
consists of ‘‘Separate Orders’’ 
which do not change any of the standing 
rules of the House. These are more 
or less housekeeping provisions which 
deem certain actions or waive the application 
of certain rules of the House. 

Section 3(A) provides for the continuation 
of certain budget enforcement 
mechanisms from the 107th Congress as 
well as deems the provisions of the 
budget resolution H. Con. Res. 353 as 
adopted by the House in the 107th Congress 
shall have effect in the 108th Congress 
until such time as a conference 
report establishing a budget for the fiscal 
year 2004 is adopted. 

Also contained in section 3(B) is a 
separate order providing for the limited 
number of exemptions to clause 
5(d) of rule 10 regarding a limitation on 
the number of subcommittees a committee 
may establish. This resolution 
grants the Committee on Armed Services, 
the Committee on International 
Relations, and the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure up 
to six subcommittees each. 

Mr. Speaker, recognizing that it 
takes time for committees to organize 
and report legislation at the beginning 
of a new Congress, section 3(D) provides 
that during the first session of 
this 108th Congress motions to suspend 
the rules shall be in order on Wednesdays 
from the beginning of the Congress 
through the second Wednesday in 
April, as though under clause 1 of rule 
15. 

Mr. Speaker, section 4 of the resolution 
is very important and significant, 
and is aimed at ensuring effective oversight 
of a crucial national priority, and 
that is what was discussed in the 
Speaker’s address to us; namely, homeland 
security. The security threats to 
our Nation are real and dangerous. 
Every branch of government, including 
the Congress, must be an integral part 
of the homeland security effort. 

In that regard, section 4 of the resolution 
establishes a Select Committee 
on Homeland Security for the 108th 
Congress with both legislative and 
oversight responsibilities. 


H12 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

The select committee would have 
legislative jurisdiction over matters 
that relate to the Homeland Security 
Act of 2002, Public Law 107–296. As the 
Act is the organic statute creating the 
new Department of Homeland Security, 
it is anticipated that the select committee 
would be the committee of jurisdiction 
over bills dealing with the 
new Department. 

Further, the select committee would 
have jurisdiction over legislation 
amending the Act such as a bill making 
technical corrections to that Act. 
In addition to the committee of primary 
jurisdiction, the Speaker would 
have the authority to refer bills to the 
select committee as an additional committee, 
either initially or sequentially. 
Otherwise, the existing jurisdictional 
rules of the House would continue to 
apply during the 108th Congress. 

The select committee would have 
oversight responsibility over laws, programs, 
and government activities relating 
to homeland security and is intended 
to serve as the primary coordinating 
committee of the House. 

Mr. Speaker, until the new Department 
of Homeland Security is up and 
running, it is difficult to predict how 
best to reflect legislative oversight and 
authorization functions for the Department 
in the House. Furthermore, during 
this transitional period, it is crucial 
that the White House and the new 
Department’s leadership have a central 
point of contact with the House. This 
new select committee will provide this 
interim capacity. It will also conduct a 
study of the operation of the rules of 
the House, including possible changes 
in committee jurisdiction with respect 
to homeland security. Those recommendations 
would be submitted to 
the Committee on Rules by September 
30, 2004. 

At this point, Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to include for the RECORD a more 
detailed, section-by-section summary 
of H. Res. 5, as well as other relevant 
material. 

SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY 
SECTION 1. RESOLVED CLAUSE 
The rules of the House of Representatives 
for the 107th Congress are adopted as the 
rules of the House for the 108th Congress 
with amendments as provided in section 2, 
and with other orders provided in sections 3 
and 4. 
SECTION 2. CHANGES IN STANDING RULES 

(a) Speaker succession. The Speaker is required 
to submit to the Clerk of the House a 
list of Members to succeed the Speaker in 
the event of a vacancy in the office of the 
Speaker until the House reconvenes in order 
to elect a new Speaker. [Rule I, clause 8(b)] 
(b) Repeal of Speaker term limit. This provision 
strikes Clause 9 of Rule 1, which limits 
a Member to no more than 4 consecutive 
terms as Speaker. [Rule I, clause 9] 
(c) Declaration of emergency recess. The 
Speaker may, when notified of an imminent 
threat to the House’s safety, declare an 
emergency recess subject to the call of the 
Chair. Allows the Speaker to accelerate or 
postpone the reconvening of the House in the 
event of an emergency. [Rule I, clause 12] 
(d) Clarification of staff access to House 
Floor. The practice of allowing leadership 
staff with Floor responsibilities access to the 
House Floor is codified. [Rule IV, clause 
2(a)(7)] 

(e) Rules Member on Budget Committee. 
The Committee on the Budget shall include 
one member of the Committee on Rules. 
Codifies action taken in the 108th Republican 
Conference organizational meeting requiring 
that one Member of the Rules Committee 
serve on the Budget Committee. [Rule X, 
clause 5(a)(2)] 
(f) Associate and professional staff. This 
change clarified that the professional staff of 
the Appropriations Committee shall comply 
with the same rules regarding their duties as 
the professional staff of all other House committees. 
Further clarifies that the associate 
or shared staff of the Appropriations Committee 
are not subject to the review of the 
Committee on House Administration in connection 
with the reporting of committee expense 
resolutions. This change is technical 
in nature [Rules X, clause 9(b)] 
(g) Postponing votes in committee. Committees 
may adopt a rule which allows the 
chairman of a committee or subcommittee 
to postpone votes on approving a measure or 
matter or on adopting an amendment and to 
resume proceedings on a postponed question 
at any time after reasonable notice. An underlying 
proposition shall remain subject to 
further debate or amendment to the same extent 
as when the question was postponed. 
[Rule XI, clause 2(h)] 
(h) Incorporation of H. Res. 168 (105th) in 
clause 3 of Rule XI ‘‘(Committee on Standards 
of Official Conduct).’’ Over the last two 
consecutive Congresses the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct’s operating 
procedure has been carried over as a separate 
order referencing a resolution adopted by the 
105th Congress. This modification codifies 
the aforementioned operating procedures. 
[Rule XII, clause 2(c)(1)] 
(i) Joint referral. Joint referral of measures 
without designation of primary jurisdiction 
will be permitted under ‘exceptional circumstances.’ 
Under this designation, the 
Speaker may designate more than one committee 
as though primary. [Rule XII, clause 
2(c)(1)] 
(j) Require dynamic scoring in Ways & 
Means reports. The Committee on Ways and 
Means is required to include in reports on 
measures amending the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 an analysis by the Joint Tax 
Committee on the macroeconomic impact of 
such legislation. The committee is not required 
to include such analysis if the Joint 
Tax Committee certifies that such analysis 
is not calculable. In addition, the chairman 
of the Ways & Means Committee may satisfy 
this requirement by inserting such analysis 
in the Congressional Record prior to the 
bill’s consideration on the floor. [Rule XIII, 
clause 3(h)] 
(k) Personal electronic equipment on the 
Floor. This provision modernizes the rules of 
the House to prohibit only the use of wireless 
telephones and personal computers on 
the House floor, thereby permitting the use 
of unobtrusive handheld electronic devices. 
[Rule XVII, clause 5] 
(l) Accounting for vacancies. The practice 
of adjusting the whole number of the House 
in the case of vacancies in the membership is 
codified. [Rule XX, clause 5] 
(m) Proceedings during call of House. This 
change clarifies that a motion to adjourn retains 
its normal privilege and is in order during 
a call of the House under clause 6 of rule 
XX. The former language of the rule could be 
interpreted to five the Speaker the discretion 
to entertain such motion. This change 
is technical in nature. [Rule XX, clause 6(c)] 
(n) Five-minute voting in series. The 
Speaker’s authority to reduce the minimum 
time for electronic voting following a fifteen-
minute vote is expanded to include all 
succeeding votes provided no other business 
intervenes and notice of possible five-minute 
voting is given. This change is technical in 
nature. [Rule XX, clause 9] 

(o) Prohibition on limitation amendments 
for the administration of taxes and tariffs 
and on measures restricting imports. Expands 
the application of clause 5(a) of rule 
XXI to include as a tax or tariff measure a 
floor amendment limiting funds in a general 
appropriation bill for the administration of a 
tax or tariff. [Rule XXI, clause 5(a)] 
(p) Motions to instruct during conference. 
Permits further motions to instruct to be offered 
after 20 calendar days, but not less 
than 10 legislative days. [Rule XXII, clause 
7(c)(1)] 
(q) Fiduciary relationship exemption for 
physicians. Redefines a fiduciary relationship 
as not including ‘‘the practice of medicine,’’ 
thereby allowing dentists and physicians 
to earn outside income up to $22,500. 
[Rule XXV, clause 2] 
(r) Perishable food as gift. Provides that 
the value of perishable food sent as a gift to 
an office shall be allocated among the individual 
receipts and not to the Member. [Rule 
XXV, clause 5(a)(1)(B)] 
(s) Gift ban exemption for charity travel. 
Clarifies the gift ban to allow Members to be 
reimbursed for travel and lodging expenses 
by a charity organization, in cases where the 
net proceeds of the event go to a qualified 
charity, and the invitation is issued by the 
charity. [Rule XXV, clause 5(a)(4)(C)] 
(t) Statutory limit on public debt. (reinstate 
‘‘Gephardt Rule’’, former Rule XXIII of 
the 106th Congress.) Provides for automatic 
House passage of joint resolution increasing 
the statutory limit on the public debt when 
the House agrees to a budget resolution that 
requires such an increase. The amount of the 
increase in the joint resolution conforms to 
the level established in the budget resolution. 
The final House vote on the budget resolution 
shall be deemed the vote on the joint 
resolution. [New Rule XXVII, former Rule 
XXVII redesignated as Rule XXVIII] 
(u) Technical corrections. Technical and 
grammatical changes are made throughout 
the rules of the rules of the House, including 
those correcting changes that were made as 
a result of the recodification of the House 
rules. 
SECTION 3. SEPARATE ORDERS 
(a)(1)–(a)(3) Continuation of budget enforcement 
mechanisms from the 107th. This 
order clarifies that section 306 of the Budget 
Act (prohibiting consideration of legislation 
within the Budget Committee’s jurisdiction, 
unless reported by the Budget Committee) 
only applies to bills and joint resolutions 
and not to simple and concurrent resolutions. 
It also makes a Section 303 point of 
order (requiring adoption of budget resolution 
before consideration of budget-related 
legislation) applicable to text made in order 
as original bill by a special rule. Specified or 
minimum levels of compensation will not be 
considered as providing new entitlement authority. 
(a)(4) Continuation of budget ‘‘deeming’’ 
resolution from the 2nd Session of the 107th 
Congress. This order establishes that the 
provisions of House Concurrent Resolution 
353 as adopted by the House in the 107th Congress, 
shall have effect in the 108th Congress 
until such time as a conference report establishing 
a budget for the fiscal year 2004 is 
adopted. 

(b) Extra subcommittees for Armed Services, 
International Relations, and Transportation 
& Infrastructure. A waiver of Rule X, 
clause 5(d), is granted for International Relations, 
Transportation & Infrastructure, and 
Armed Services for 6 subcommittees in the 
108th Congress. 

January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H13 

(e) Numbering of bills. In the 108th Congress, 
the first 10 numbers for bills (H.R. 1 
through H.R. 10) shall be reserved for assignment 
by the Speaker to such bills as he may 
designate when introduced during the first 
session. 
(d) Wednesday suspension day. During the 
first session of the 108th Congress, motions 
to suspend the rules shall be in order on 
Wednesdays through the second Wednesday 
in April. 
SECTION 4. SELECT COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND 
SECURITY 

This section establishes the Select Committee 
on Homeland Security for the 108th 
Congress. It establishes that the Select Committee 
will have legislative jurisdiction to 
develop recommendations and report to the 
House by bill or otherwise on such matters 
that relates to the Homeland Security Act of 
12002 (P.L. 107–296). 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 

Mr. Speaker, we all remember how 
partisan, divisive and, most importantly, 
unproductive the last Congress 
was. Despite the President’s campaign 
promise to change the tone in Washington, 
nothing really changed in the 
way Republicans ran the House of Representatives. 
In fact, over the past 2 
years, the Republican majority had a 
well-established and easily documented 
track record of denying the minority a 
voice in proceedings and deliberations 
of the House, and that, unfortunately, 
played a large role in the failure of the 
Republican Congress to address America’s 
critical concerns, from the economy 
and homeland security to health 
care and retirement security. 

But, in the spirit of the new year, Mr. 
Speaker, Democrats came to the floor 
today hoping that Republicans might 
turn over a new leaf, that they might 
agree to a rules package to operate the 
House as a deliberate, democratic institution 
in which all points of view 
have a right to be heard. Unfortunately, 
the package before us only 
makes things worse, making changes 
that only assure that the voice of the 
minority will be heard less and less. 
For that reason, I rise in opposition to 

H. Res. 5. I will offer a motion to commit 
at the end of this debate, and I 
urge every Member of this body who 
believes that all of the American people 
have a right to be heard and a right 
to participate in a democratic, small 
‘‘d’’, institution to vote for it. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not the Politburo; 
this is the United States House of 
Representatives. It is high time that 
the majority remembered that very 
clear distinction. We are not here to 
raise our hands in unison; we are here 
to debate what is in the best interests 
of this country, and there are many 
differing views in this body about how 
to achieve that end. Those views 
should and must be heard. 

Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a 
few minutes to explain why I and the 
Democratic Caucus oppose these rules 
changes proposed by the Republican 
majority. As I said, we see these 
changes, along with the majority’s 

record of stifling dissent, as 
counterintuitive to the notion of the 
democratic process. We see some of 
these changes as fig leaves or, as my 
good friend the gentleman from Wisconsin 
(Mr. OBEY) is often heard to say, 
giving Members a chance to pose for 
holy pictures. We see some of these 
changes as attempts to cover up what 
is really happening in terms of the Federal 
budget, both on the spending and 
tax sides. And finally, we see some of 
these changes as allowing Members to 
skirt the intent of the ethics rules in 
this body, something that only sullies 
the reputation of an honorable institution. 


For example, the majority took great 
pains in 1995 to abolish the practice of 
proxy voting. I am not here to pass 
judgment on that old practice. I can 
only say that the Republican majority 
condemned Democrats when we held 
the majority for allowing Members to 
vote by proxy in committee. However, 
the Republican majority has encountered 
some of the same problems that 
made proxy voting a useful tool for 
committees to get their work done. Because 
the Republican majority has refused 
to negotiate committee ratios 
that accurately reflect and fairly reflect 
the numbers in this body, their 
Members have been spread too thin and 
oftentimes must choose between one 
committee’s proceedings and another. 

b1445 
Consequently, there have been a 
number of markups held where Democrats 
have been able to pass amendments 
because some Republicans have 
voted for those amendments and because 
other Republican Members have 
been absent. The majority has decided 
that the best way to deal with those 
rare occasions in which Democrats actually 
win a vote is to ensure that 
votes cannot be taken until the Chair 
of the full committee or a subcommittee 
has all the votes in the 
room, somewhat akin to proxy voting. 
This change proposed by the majority 
would allow those Chairs to postpone 
indefinitely votes on ordered 
questions. There is no definition in the 
rule about when votes must be called 
by, and there is no definition in the 
rule for what constitutes reasonable 
notice. 
Frankly, Mr. Speaker, this rule is a 
recipe for autocracy in the committees 
of this body. My motion to commit will 
delete this provision from the package 
of the rules for the 108th Congress. 
Secondly, the Republican majority 
seems intent on cooking the Federal 
budgetary books in so many ways that 
a new recipe was sure to find its way 
into this package, and so it has. The 
majority has now included a rule providing 
that no tax bill may be considered 
unless the Joint Committee on 
Taxation has included an analysis in 
the report accompanying that bill on 
the macroeconomic impact of such legislation. 
And just what is the macroeconomic 
impact? Why, it is nothing 

more than dynamic scoring, a methodology 
that has been discounted and 
outright dismissed by any economist 
worth his or her salt, including the 
chairman of the Federal Reserve. 

As Chairman Greenspan has said 
about dynamic scoring: ‘‘The analytical 
tools required to achieve it are deficient 
. . . no model currently in use 
can predict macroeconomic effects 
without substantial ad hoc adjustments 
that effectively override the internal 
structure of the model.’’ In 
other words, Mr. Speaker, it does not 
work, an example of what President 
Bush had called ‘‘fuzzy math.’’ 

Yet, the Republican majority persists 
in believing that this bogus economic 
analysis of tax policy is real and reliable. 
But I would contend the only real 
thing that is real and reliable about 
dynamic scoring is that it will serve as 
a cover-up for the true impact of the 
losses of revenue to the Federal Treasury 
generated by tax cuts endorsed by 
this White House and the Republican 
majority. My motion to commit will 
delete this provision from the package 
of the rules of the 108th Congress. 

Motions to instruct conferees have 
been successfully used by Democrats 
and, may I add, by the Republicans 
when they were in the minority, to 
fight for important issues like aviation 
security when otherwise denied that 
ability by the Republican majority. Because 
Democratic Members are far too 
often shut out of the deliberative process 
when a bill reaches the floor, a motion 
to instruct is sometimes the only 
way a Member might be able to bring 
an issue up for discussion. But the Republican 
majority, who did not seem 
particularly anxious to do much work 
in Washington in the past 2 years, considers 
these attempts to open the discussion 
in the House as a nuisance, 
rather than as a means to bring democracy 
back to the institution. 

So Republicans have an amendment 
in this package that further restricts 
the right of any Member, Republican or 
Democrat, to offer a motion to instruct 
by requiring that in addition to the 20 
calendar days from the time a conference 
is appointed, 10 legislative days 
must elapse. The new rule is so loosely 
drafted that it is questionable whether 
those 20 calendar days and 10 legislative 
days run concurrently or not. Either 
way, since this body is in session 
so seldom, 10 legislative days would fill 
up an entire month, further delaying 
the ability of Members to bring up legitimate 
issues relating to those bills 
submitted to conference. 

Mr. Speaker, this provision is such a 
blatant slap in the face of the democratic 
process in the House of Representatives, 
the Republican majority 
should hang its collective head. For 
that reason, my motion to commit will 
strike this amendment from the rules 
package. 

Mr. Speaker, since I have been in 
Congress, I have had the opportunity 
to serve on two special committees created 
for the purpose of revising and 


H14 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

strengthening our ethics rules and regulations. 
The Republican majority 
made much of past abuses in this body, 
in spite of the fact that Members on 
both sides of the aisle were caught in 
these situations. Yet, now the Republicans 
believe they have such a safe and 
secure majority for the foreseeable future, 
they want to undo some of the 
significant strides that were made by 
these two special committees. 

The Republican majority has opened 
a proverbial can of worms by including 
several items in their package. The 
first might be called the ‘‘pizza rule.’’ 
Because some outsiders like to provide 
large quantities of free food and drink 
to Members’ offices night after night, 
this new Republican provision would 
carve out an exception to the gift rule. 

We also have the ‘‘I have a second job 
and I want to get paid for it’’ rule. 
Members are currently prohibited from 
acting in certain fiduciary capacities 
and thus are not allowed to receive 
compensation for practicing a profession 
that offers services involving a fiduciary 
relationship. 

Mr. Speaker, no matter how worthy a 
profession might be, why should we 
create a special exemption in the rules 
for the practice of medicine? If we do it 
for one, why not everyone? I think this 
House would be far better served if we 
just kept the rule the way it is now. 

For these reasons, my motion to 
commit will strike the provisions in 
the rules package that relate to ethics 
rules. 

My motion to commit also strikes 
two separate orders contained in section 
3 of the resolution. The first provision 
I will seek to strike establishes 
the budget resolution adopted by the 
House in the second session of the 107th 
Congress as in effect in this Congress 
until such time as a conference report 
establishing a budget for fiscal year 
2004 is passed. 

Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues 
will say this will merely allow 
the House to finish work on the appropriations 
bills for fiscal year 2003. Perhaps 
we should have done that in the 
107th Congress rather than waiting to 
do it in the 108th Congress, with budget 
numbers outdated and unrealistic 
given the current economic circumstances. 


In addition, the appropriations number 
in the House-passed budget resolution 
of the 107th Congress is $749 billion; 
yet, the Republican leadership has 
agreed with the White House on budget 
numbers exceeding that figure. In addition, 
the budget resolution of the second 
session of last Congress maintains 
highway numbers that are also outdated 
and which, frankly, are not good 
policy. For example, those numbers 
will not allow for increased highway 
construction money that might be prudently 
spent throughout the country to 
create jobs and restore crumbling infrastructure. 


Secondly, in furtherance of the Republican 
majority’s agenda to stifle debate 
by cutting debate, cutting off 

amendments, and staying out of town 
as much as possible, this package contains 
a separate order that will make 
Wednesday a suspension day through 
the second Wednesday in April. Now, 
this order will certainly cut down on 
the work of the Committee on Rules, 
since one of our best work products has 
been a rule making Wednesday a suspension 
day. But Democrats believe 
that far too many bills are considered 
under suspension already and that the 
House is thus denied the opportunity 
to fully debate and amend legislation. 

In my motion to commit, this provision 
would be stricken; but we have 
also included language that calls on 
the Republican majority to bring up 
fewer, rather than more, bills on suspension, 
and that no bill should be considered 
on suspension if it authorizes 
or makes appropriations in excess of 
$100 million. There is ample time in our 
calendar to spend on the floor debating 
legislation. We should not be institutionalizing 
shortened weekdays and 
cutting off debate. 

We have also included in the Democratic 
motion to commit language calling 
on the Republican leadership to ensure 
that the minority party will be 
able to fully participate in the legislative 
process. We have recommended 
that they strive to ensure that five 
‘‘good government’’ ideas are followed 
in the House. 

First, so that Members might know 
what they are voting on when they 
vote, we call on the Republican leadership 
to ensure that Members have conference 
reports available to them 3 calendar 
days before such a conference report 
is considered in the House; and at 
the very least, at a bare minimum, no 
conference report should come to the 
floor unless every Member has had 24 
hours to review it; not exactly a revolutionary 
concept. 

Second, we asked the Republican 
leadership to reduce the number of 
waivers contained in rules reported 
from the Committee on Rules. This is 
especially important in the consideration 
of bills that have been reported 
and that go straight to the floor. Many 
times, even members of the committee 
of jurisdiction are not sure if the bill 
that comes to the floor is the same bill 
that was reported, and it would only 
enhance the legislative process and democracy 
if Members had adequate time 
to review legislation. 

Third, we call on the Republican 
leadership to allow the House to debate 
and amend legislation by reducing the 
number of important bills that are considered 
on the suspension calendar. 

In that regard, we are, fourthly, asking 
that the majority ensure that more 
alternatives and substitutes be allowed 
in rules adopted by the Committee on 
Rules. 

Finally, we ask the Republican leadership 
to allow more legislation to be 
considered on the floor under open 
rules so that more Democrats may 
offer amendments. 

Finally, Mr. Speaker, Democrats 
must raise strong objections to the 

manner in which the Republican leadership 
has gone about creating a Select 
Committee on Homeland Security. 
This provision was added last night 
with no consultation with the minority, 
and we believe that is no way to 
begin a new Congress when the issue of 
homeland security is one that does not 
belong to either party. We are all 
Americans here, and we should be involved 
in the deliberations surrounding 
the provisions of the Homeland Security 
Act. 

Mr. Speaker, I know our motion to 
commit will not pass today; but I do 
believe it is important that we talk 
about these issues, because in the long 
run it is for the good of the institution. 
I am proud to serve here, and I am 
proud to represent the people of my 
congressional district. I think that I, 
along with every other Member of this 
body, should be able to fully participate 
in the process of making laws, setting 
policy, and determining the course 
of this Nation in the years to come. 

While I recognize that he with the 
most votes wins, I also know that if 
someone has the most votes, they 
should not fear an opposing point of 
view. For too long the Republican 
Party has seemed, through their words 
and actions, to fear dissent among 
their own ranks, as well as the opposing 
view that may be held by the minority. 
We are a democracy; and we 
should never forget that, for in a democracy 
the rights of the minority are 
protected while at the same time advancing 
the will of the majority. I hope 
my Republican colleagues will remember 
that in the 108th Congress. 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

I was inclined early on to believe 
that my friend, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. FROST), might be supportive 
of our package; but I have now come to 
the conclusion that he would at best be 
undecided on our package, and he has 
raised a number of questions. 

I believe that I should say that we 
clearly plan to work in the area of 
homeland security with my friend, the 
gentleman from Texas, and other members 
of the minority in addressing 
issues of concern when we proceed with 
this very important work. We want to 
work in a bipartisan way; and I happen 
to believe that this package which we 
have come forth with will, as I said, increase 
the accountability and deliberative 
nature of the institution. I would 
hope that we could have both Democrats 
and Republicans supporting it. 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. STENHOLM). 

(Mr. STENHOLM asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 

Mr. STENHOLM. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the rules package before 
us today. While it contains several 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H15 

items which I support, particularly the 
deeming resolution setting spending 
limits for the unfinished appropriation 
bills, the package contains two items 
which tilt the rules in favor of policies 
which will more easily send our Nation 
further into red ink. I would ask the 
majority to reconsider both of these 
proposals. 

One of the reforms the majority 
made with great fanfare as part of the 
Contract with America in 1995 was repeal 
of the Gephardt rule, which would 
spin off separate legislation increasing 
the debt limit upon passage of the debt 
resolution without a separate vote or 
opportunity for debate on the amendments. 


Now that our national debt is growing 
at a record pace under their policies, 
less than 6 months ago the administration 
asked us to increase the debt 
ceiling by $400 billion; Christmas Eve, 
the administration is asking us to increase 
the debt ceiling again to $6.4 
trillion. 

The majority now, under their rules 
package, has decided that greater openness 
and accountability regarding our 
national debt perhaps is not such a 
good thing after all. I ask Members to 
reconsider that. Just as credit card 
spending limits serve as tools to force 
families to examine their household 
budgets, the statutory debt limit reminds 
our Nation to more closely 
evaluate taxing and spending policies. 
Reviving the Gephardt rule will allow 
Members to avoid taking responsibility 
for paying the bills we incur by our 
votes. 

Now, the implementation of dynamic 
scoring also should raise a red flag to 
those who call themselves conservative 
in this body. Under the logic of those 
advocating dynamic scoring, the tax 
cut we passed last year should have resulted 
in greater surpluses than was 
being projected last spring. We can disagree 
about the extent the tax cut contributed 
to the return of the deficit, 
but it is clear that it did not have a dynamic 
effect on producing higher surpluses 
and revenues. 

The conservative approach, to me, is 
to be conservative in budget projections. 
If we err on the side of being conservative 
and cautious, Congress can 
easily deal with the problem of having 
more money than was projected. But 
when we err on the side of being too optimistic, 
we have a much greater challenge 
in dealing with fiscal problems 
such as those before us now. 

We are paying the price today for ignoring 
the warnings of experts in the 
past. We should not ignore the warnings 
of those that say changing to dynamic 
scoring will contribute to further 
problems of the deficit and debt of 
this country. 

Vote ‘‘no’’ on the rules changes; vote 
‘‘yes’’ on cutting the interest taxes on 
the American people. 

b1500 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 21/2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Minnesota (Mr. OBERSTAR). 

(Mr. OBERSTAR asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, the 
proposal to create a new Select Committee 
on Homeland Security interestingly 
does not make any changes in the 
legislative jurisdiction of the committees 
outlined in rule 10 of the rules of 
the House. For instance, in the Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure 
we have handled complex 
aviation security issues for 28 years. 
We have held dozens of hearings, classified 
briefings on aviation security. We 
have monitored security at U.S. and 
foreign airports. We have passed landmark 
legislation like the Aviation Security 
Improvement Act of 1990 in response 
to the terrorism attack on Pan 
Am 103, and in the aftermath of the 
September 11, the Aviation and Transportation 
Security Act of 2001. We have 
a great body of expertise on aviation 
security issues and the legislation to 
improve security. 

Now, I am puzzled that a moment ago 
the Speaker said the ‘‘select committee 
will be our eyes and ears of the 
House. The standing committees will 
maintain their jurisdictions and will 
still have authorization and oversight 
responsibilities.’’ 

Now I take that to mean that nothing 
in the package would deprive the 
House of the American people of the 
expertise of the committee and the 
members and staff of the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure. But 
it is not clear, the legislative proposal 
on the select committee includes 
‘‘matters that relate to the Homeland 
Security Act of 2002.’’ 

As I read the proposal, the new committee 
would not have primary jurisdiction 
over legislation involving programs 
administered by the Department 
of Homeland Security. The explanation 
offered a moment ago by the distinguished 
chairman of the Committee on 
Rules does not clarify that jurisdictional 
question. 

Now, let me pose an issue. Title 14 of 
the Homeland Security Act, entitled 
Arming Pilots Against Terrorism, establishes 
a program to deputize airline 
pilots as Federal law enforcement officers 
and enables them to carry firearms 
on board a plane. That provision 
was based upon a bill developed in our 
committee which passed the House. 
The question is, if a new bill were introduced 
to repeal that rule, would 
that bill be primarily referred to the 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
or to the Committee on 
Homeland Security? I would ask the 
gentleman that. Would the gentleman 
respond? 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 

Mr. OBERSTAR. I yield to the gentleman 
from California. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, let me 
just say that it is very clear that the 
Speaker does have authority to refer 
legislation, and it is his intent to ensure 
that we maintain the jurisdiction 

of those committees. And the expertise 
that the gentleman offered on this very 
important issue, and I remember his 
testimony upstairs in the Committee 
on Rules on this, it will be very valuable 
as this issue is addressed. And it is 
quite possible that the gentleman may 
or a member of his committee may be 
a member of the Select Committee on 
Homeland Security. So I can assure the 
gentleman that we are going to do everything 
possible to keep the expertise 
that is out there involved in this process. 


Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for 
yielding. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. KUCINICH). 

Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, last fall 
it took weeks for the Members of the 
House, the press and the public to figure 
out who inserted a special interest 
provision in the homeland security bill 
to exempt Eli Lilly and other manufacturers 
of thimerosal. We did not know 
the provision was in the bill before we 
voted on it. After it was found we could 
not figure out how it got there. Now 
that is no way to make law. 

This is why I am supporting the motion 
to commit which would mandate 
that conference reports are made available 
to Members at least 24 hours before 
a vote. This requirement would 
not be permitted to be waived. 

Members of this body deserve to 
know what they are voting on. The 
practice of sneaking in unrelated provisions 
in thick conference reports in 
the dead of night is unacceptable. The 
reason it is done is to cause Members 
who normally would not support a provision 
to do so by burying it in a conference 
report at the last minute when 
there is little chance for it to be found. 

The thimerosal exception that was 
slipped into the Homeland Security bill 
is a prime example. The thimerosal exemption 
was a big Christmas gift to Eli 
Lilly and other thimerosal manufacturers. 
In the last election cycle is it 
any surprise that Eli Lilly was one of 
the top pharmaceutical contributors, 
giving $1.6 million? In return, they got 
a thimerosal exception that they have 
been lobbying for all year. Eli Lilly’s 
first attempt was last spring when it 
placed the exemption in the comprehensive 
bill, but since the bill did 
not get anywhere in the Subcommittee 
on Health, it switched tactics to get 
the exemption in Homeland Security. 

The exemption effectively shields Eli 
Lilly from all lawsuits from claimants 
injured by thimerosal. One of the concerns 
being expressed is that there is a 
possible link between thimerosal and 
autism. The exemption even closed the 
door on litigation that was ongoing at 
the time the legislation was passed. It 
is time to open the conference process 
and stop the back room political maneuvers 
that lead to secret provisions. 
We must stop the abuses of the congressional 
process. We must allow 
Members to know what they are voting 
on. Support the motion to commit. 


H16 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. FRANK). 

Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. 
Speaker, this rules package is a very 
important continuation of the majority’s 
effort to shut down democratic 
debate. The ranking minority member 
spoke about this rule allowing the 
chairs of committees to roll votes. Basically 
what it represents is a willingness 
of the Republican Members to roll 
over, to beg, to sit up and do whatever 
their leadership tells them, because 
what this does is degrade the possibility 
of democratic debate in committees. 


People not familiar with the jargon 
probably do not fully understand what 
is being proposed. You will go to a 
committee session, a markup as we 
call them, and vote on the legislation, 
and you will offer an amendment to try 
to change things. Under these rules 
you may very well not know whether 
your amendment has won or lost. 
There will be a debate on the amendment 
and the Chair of that committee 
can then postpone the voting on that 
amendment until the end of that session. 
And what do you do if you have 
offered an amendment that might be 
somewhat controversial that has a 
chance to pass? What do you do if you 
could have passed the amendment if 
you have made a slight change? How do 
you then decide what to do next? Obviously 
there is no way you can have a 
rational debate in a committee if, having 
offered an amendment, you cannot 
tell whether or not that amendment 
has passed or not. 

So what this does is simply ratify the 
Republican approach, which is all 
power is lodged in whatever leadership 
is in charge at the particular moment 
and the Members are to be excused 
from the irritation of having to think 
about it. When the majority came to 
power in 1995 they wanted to give it a 
proxy. They said the problem with 
proxy voting is that people vote without 
listening to the debate. They are 
not there. They vote by proxy. So they 
have now come up with a proposal that 
has all of the abuses of proxies and 
none of the efficiencies. At least proxies 
allowed you to determine an issue 
one at a time. 

What will happen is you will go to a 
committee meeting. Members will not 
be there. They will troop in obediently 
at the end and vote as the Chair tells 
them, and it will have destroyed the 
possibility of debate earlier because 
you simply cannot logically legislate if 
you do not know what the outcome has 
been of these amendments. 

Now the majority has succeeded in a 
number of ways in this House, during 
my tenure here with their being in control, 
in shutting down debate. I have to 
say that sadly they have had an accomplice 
in this, the media. We had wide 
coverage in the press gallery of our ceremonial 
oath taking. Now that we are 
dealing with extremely controversial 
measures that will further the degrada


tion of democracy in the U.S. House of 
Representatives, very few people are 
here to cover it. So I guess they will 
once again get away with it. But the 
consequence will be very clear. The extent 
to which there is now rational debate 
and openness in the committees 
will be substantially diminished. 

The Republican leadership is apparently 
willing obediently to vote for 
this rules package, although I am told 
that many of them objected to parts of 
it, to give once again their right to 
make decisions to their leadership. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MOORE). 

(Mr. MOORE asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the House rules package 
the majority is proposing for the 108th 
Congress. 

The majority has turned its back on 
fiscal responsibility by attempting to 
hide large future increases in our national 
debt by reinstating the so-called 
‘‘Gephardt Rule.’’ This rules change 
will allow the House to avoid a separate 
vote on the debt limit, preventing 
full and open debate on a policy with 
long-term consequences to our Nation’s 
fiscal health. 

Last June, Mr. Speaker, we had a full 
debate as Congress raised the limit on 
the debt by $450 billion. I opposed this 
increase because the House failed at 
that time to reevaluate the policies 
that required us to increase the statutory 
limit on debt in the first place. 
But at least, at least we had a debate. 

An increase in the debt limit should 
require action by Congress and the 
President to put the fiscal house back 
in order. But now the majority party is 
resorting to the tactics that they opposed 
just last year. They are attempting 
to hide votes to increase the national 
debt by reviving this rule. 

The majority will eagerly support 
the President’s proposal to be unveiled 
today which will add more than $600 
billion to the debt over the next 10 
years. They should be willing to stand 
up and be counted when the time 
comes to pay the bill by raising the 
debt limit. The new proposed rule will 
allow the majority to avoid taking responsibility 
for paying our bills. The 
majority’s rule will impose a new tax, 
a debt tax, a tax equal to the interest 
payments on our $6.2 trillion national 
debt, a tax that cannot be repealed. 

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote for the motion to recommit and 
oppose the rules package that will result 
in a new debt tax increase for all 
Americans. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time I have remaining? 


The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LAHOOD). The gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. SLAUGHTER) has 41/2 minutes 
remaining. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SHERMAN). 

(Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding me time. 

Mr. Speaker, I rise to address section 
2(J) of these rules providing for dynamic 
scoring of tax bills. I thought 
the Arthur Andersen accounting firm 
had been dissolved. Instead it is being 
moved wholesale into the Committee 
on Ways and Means and the Joint Committee 
on Taxation. 

With dynamic scoring, every tax cut 
for the wealthy can be scored as making 
money for the Treasury. The first 
President George Bush described this 
as voodoo economics, while the advisors 
unfortunately of the current 
President seem nostalgic for supply-
side trickle down economics. 

The proof that dynamic scoring 
makes no sense is that dynamic scoring 
is provided in these rules for money 
spent to improve our economy. So if we 
were to spend $100 billion over 10 years 
improving vocational education, virtually 
every economist would agree 
that that will at least help our economy, 
maybe will help our economy to 
the point where the tax revenues outweigh 
the expenditures. And yet there 
is no recognition of the fact that 
spending money on education produces 
money eventually for our Treasury. 

In contrast, if we were to spend $100 
billion over 10 years by giving tax 
breaks to the wealthiest Americans, 
some economists would say the cost of 
the Treasury exceeds $100 billion because 
it will have an adverse impact on 
our economy, drive up interest rates, 
et cetera. And yet instead we will no 
doubt get a dynamic score that says 
tax cuts do not cost the Treasury any 
money but spending on education, oh, 
that costs. 

That is why Alan Greenspan told us 
that unfortunately the analytical tools 
required to achieve dynamic scoring 
are deficient. Accordingly, we should 
be especially cautious about adopting 
technical scoring procedures that 
might be susceptible to overly optimistic 
assessments. 

In summary, the currently relatively 
straightforward scoring has served us 
well. I think Mr. Greenspan is correct. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 21/2 minutes, the remainder of my 
time, to the gentleman from Mississippi 
(Mr. TAYLOR). 

Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, we are barely 3 hours into 
this Congress and the political hedonists 
of this Congress have struck their 
first blow. You know hedonism, if it 
feels good do it regardless of the consequences. 


Well, that is exactly what those people 
who have voted repeatedly to raise 
the debt limit and to stick our children 
and our children’s children with our 
bills have done. Now they want to do it 
even better. 

One of the few things that controlled 
their urge to run up the bill and stick 
our kids with it was at least a law that 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H17 

said we had to vote to raise the debt 
limit. Now they want to do away with 
that law. They want a rule that says if 
they pass a budget we do not have to 
raise the debt limit. 

I would remind them that in the 19 
months since the Bush budget became 
law, that we have stuck our children 
and our children’s children with 
$749,529,498,242 worth of new debt. It did 
not stimulate the economy. It stimulated 
the debt. It is political hedonism. 
You heard it here first. You are going 
to hear it a lot. 

Just a little while ago the Speaker of 
the House said, ‘‘We pledge to fight 
those who would endanger our freedom.’’ 
Those of you who would bankrupt 
our Nation will destroy our freedom. 
And, therefore, just as the Speaker 
pledged to fight those who would endanger 
our freedom, I pledge to fight 
you tooth and nail on every effort to 
increase the national debt and every effort 
to hide the way that you do it. 

b1515 
The last time we had to have a vote, 
it was scheduled for three o’clock in 
the morning. 
My dad’s taught me a lot in life; but 
generally, one of his best rules is anything 
a person does past midnight, 
they are probably not very proud of, 
and I am sure my colleagues were not 
proud of the fact that they raised the 
debt limit. So now my colleagues do 
not want to have that vote at all. 
Mr. Speaker, I am opposing these 
rule changes; and I would ask every 
Member to do so who believes in accountability, 
believes in standing up 
and talking to the citizens and saying, 
yes, I did that and this is the reason 
why or, no, I did not oppose this rule. 
If my colleagues have come here to 
hide from the truth, if they have come 
here to stick their children and their 
children’s children with their bills, 
then vote for it. 
Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of the time. 
Mr. Speaker, we began today with 
wonderful bipartisan statements that 
came from both the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PELOSI), the new minority 
leader, and the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. HASTERT), the Speaker, right 
behind me here in this Chamber; and 
we want to see that spirit continue 
today, and obviously we very much 
want to have that spirit continue 
through this 108th Congress because we 
have many very serious challenges that 
we face as a Nation. 
Number one, of course, is our national 
security and, along with that, 
homeland security, the challenges 
abroad. Right next to that, of course, is 
focusing on getting this economy moving, 
which the President talked about 
earlier today in Chicago; and as we 
look at this opening day rules package, 
I am very proud of the fact that it does 
more to focus on the very important 
issue of minority rights than anything 
that was done by my friends on the 
other side of the aisle during their 4 

decades of uninterrupted, one-party 
control of this institution. 

If my colleagues look at the reforms 
that we have maintained we initiated 
once we became a majority and frankly 
built upon, they do, in fact, increase 
the accountability and the deliberative 
nature of this Congress. We have items 
that are included in this measure 
which guarantee the minority the right 
to offer a motion to recommit on legislation. 


Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of 
serving for 14 years here in the minority 
until in 1994 we won the majority. 
During that period of time, there were 
numerous occasions when the then-Republican 
minority was denied the 
chance to even offer a motion to recommit. 


Something else that we have done 
that we are very proud of, Mr. Speaker, 
again focusing on minority rights, has 
been to ensure that one-third of the 
funding level for minority staffing on 
committees is provided to the minority. 
Once again, during the 14 years 
that I was privileged to serve here in 
the minority, we saw numerous occasions 
when the then-Republican minority 
was denied the chance to have even 
a modicum of investigative staff on 
certain committees; and the numbers 
were very, very heavily skewed against 
the then-Republican minority. We are 
providing a much higher level of funding 
for the Democratic minority. 

Also, we heard this discussion earlier 
about the issue of proxy voting. The 
issue of proxy voting had to do with 
committee chairmen arbitrarily utilizing 
the proxy of Members who were 
not even in the room, in the building, 
quite possibly they were not even in 
our Nation’s capital; and yet their 
votes were being cast on issues that 
they may not have even known about. 
So we chose to bring an end to proxy 
voting. 

Mr. Speaker, one of the things is that 
we have learned that we do have a very 
narrow majority. It is a little greater 
than in the 107th Congress, I am happy 
to say; but it is still the second narrowest 
in recent times, and we do have 
the challenge of trying to manage and 
move very important legislation 
through this body. 

Mr. Speaker, I believe that we have, 
as a Republican majority, learned from 
some of the actions of the Democratic 
majority; and we went, as I said, for 4 
decades without being in the majority. 
We served in the minority. It took us 
time to learn about the process of governing. 
We were not able to do that 
overnight, and so I will admit there are 
some modifications that we have made, 
and providing the opportunity for committee 
chairmen, obviously working, 
as has been the case in the 107th Congress 
and earlier Congresses, with the 
minority to roll votes in committee 
while guaranteeing Members the opportunity 
to offer second-degree 
amendments is something that will 
again enhance the ability to move legislation 
effectively; and we hope, as has 

been the case in the past, that much of 
that will be done in a bipartisan way. 

We have established this Department 
of Homeland Security. We do have dynamic 
scoring. I know there was concern 
raised about that. It is a very, 
very small consideration. The Office of 
Management and Budget, the Congressional 
Budget Office will not be engaged 
in this; but we will see the Joint 
Committee on Taxation doing it. Why? 
Very simply, because we believe that 
behavioral patterns should be taken 
into consideration when we look at the 
impact of a tax cut on the flow of revenues 
to the Federal Treasury. 

Today, I introduced legislation which 
reduces the top rate on capital gains 
from 20 percent down to 10 percent. I 
introduced it perspectively, encouraging 
the American people to once 
again invest, to get into the market 
and to invest. What the bill that I have 
introduced basically says is that during 
a 2-year period, if people invest and 
they hold on to that asset for 1 year, 
they will be able to see a tremendous 
cut, a cut of one-half, from 20 percent 
down to 10 percent and from 10 percent 
to 5 percent for those in the 15 percent 
bracket. 

Mr. Speaker, I would argue and I believe 
that every shred of evidence over 
the past and with the scoring procedure 
that we have put into place will 
show that the rich pay more in taxes. 
Why? Because we have often a lock-in 
effect. More than half the American 
people are members of the investor 
class today. People are invested in 
markets through 401(k)s, individual retirement 
accounts. They have got some 
appreciated assets with real estate 
homes and all, and we know that the 
market has dropped tremendously, but 
the President’s plan is encouraging 
economic growth. 

We, in the bill that I have just introduced 
in a bipartisan way, are encouraging 
economic growth with that as 
well; and with economic growth, Mr. 
Speaker, we are going to see an increase 
in the flow of revenues to the 
Federal Treasury. That is what the 
scoring procedure that we have put 
into place for the Joint Committee on 
Taxation will do. It will simply provide 
that information, making that information 
available. 

So we have a very fair, balanced 
measure here which again increases the 
deliberative nature of this institution 
and does increase the accountability. 

On the issue of the debt limit, every 
Member will be accountable because 
that vote will be cast when we deal 
with the budget resolution itself. So we 
are going to see every Member accountable 
for their votes that they cast 
right here. 

We have spectacular leadership from 
Speaker HASTERT. This is a measure 
that will allow him to deal with the 
very serious challenges that our Nation 
faces in the 108th Congress. 

Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to the House Rules packages being offered 
today by the majority. Over the previous 


H18 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

four Congresses, which have been controlled 
by the Republican party, the House rules became 
increasingly hostile to the rights of the 
minority. This proposal continues that trend. 

Let there be no misunderstanding—when I 
speak of the rights of the minority I am speaking 
of the rights of the 47 percent of all Americans 
who are represented by Democratic and 
Independent Members of Congress. It is their 
rights which are being abused when their 
Member of Congress is treated unfairly. 

For example, the right of all Members, and 
particularly the minority, to file its views on 
legislation reported by a committee, has been 
reduced to 2 days. During the 40 years of 
Democratic control the minority was always 
permitted 3 days. 

Similarly, committee ratios have been consistently 
stacked against the minority. For example, 
on the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, during Democratic control the majority 
representation of the committee was always 
within two percentage points of its ratio 
in the House, and the difference averaged 
less than one percent. In the past three Congresses, 
under Republican control, the difference 
was more than 3 percent. In short, the 
Republican majority has robbed the Democratic 
minority of seats they deserve in our 
committee. 

In the last Congress, the Republican rules 
package radically changed the jurisdiction of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee by 
transferring its jurisdiction over securities and 
insurance to the Committee on Financial Services. 
This change was done without a single 
hearing at which Members of the majority or 
minority were permitted to present their views, 
or without a single markup at which minority 
Members could vote or suggest alternatives. 
Now the Republican majority is doing the 
same thing with the establishment of a Select 
Committee on Homeland Security. 

The majority has not only trampled upon the 
rights of the minority, but also upon the rights 
of individual citizens. For example, Republicans 
eliminated a longstanding rule of the 
House that permitted individuals who were required 
to appear before a committee under a 
subpoena the right to have television cameras 
turned off. The rule had permitted all other 
media to cover the hearing, but the rule gave 
the witness the right to some level of fairness. 

In this context, I look with interest every 
year to see what new rules will be adopted in 
response to the majority’s irritation with the minority’s 
invocation of its merger remaining 
rights. 

This year there are several interesting 
changes. Perhaps the most interesting one is 
the permission to committees to adopt rules 
allowing the chairman to postpone votes on 
bills and amendments in committee. When my 
Republican colleagues took control of the 
House they complained that proxy voting permitted 
Members to cast votes on matters without 
attending the debate that accompanied the 
matter. It now appears that by permitting votes 
to be postponed to a time certain, Members 
will no longer have to attend committee markups 
while important amendments are being 
debated. Instead, they will merely have to 
show up at a specified time to vote. It sounds 
an awful lot like proxy voting to me. 

Another rule change stretches out the length 
of time before the minority may offer motions 
to instruct conferees by requiring a minimum 
of 10 legislative days. Again, this rule limits 
minority rights. 

While some rule changes are technical in 
nature, it appears that the other substantive 
amendments are designed to make it easier 
for my Republican colleagues to plunge our 
Nation further into debt. Not satisfied with 
throwing away the progress made during the 
Clinton administration, which changed annual 
budget deficits to surpluses, the Republicans 
in the last Congress immediately threw the 
country back into budget deficits while raiding 
our Social Security and Medicare trust funds. 

While they seemed to take delight in placing 
more and more tax cuts on the Floor during 
the past Congress, it was a lot more painful 
for them to figure out how to pay for them. So 
this year they are adopting a host of rules to 
hide their budget profligacy. No longer will 
they require Members to vote on raising the 
statutory limit on the debt. Now their vote on 
the budget resolution will automatically raise 
the debt limit. 

Moreover, the rules continue the so-called 
‘‘deeming’’ resolution, which allows the House 
to pretend it has adopted a binding budget 
resolution when in reality, only one House has 
acted. The rules would also require the Ways 
and Means Committee to include so-called 
‘‘dynamic scoring’’ on amendments to the tax 
code. While ‘‘dynamic scoring’’ has no real 
definition, it is generally understood to mean a 
way to pretend that a tax cut increase revenues 
rather than decreasing them. We heard 
all of this same nonsense during the Reagan 
administration and talk about the Laffer curve. 
Ultimately, we saw only greater deficits. 

Mr. Speaker, it is time for my Republican 
colleagues to stop playing games with the 
House rules. We must respect the rights of 
Democratic Members of this body, and more 
importantly, the rights of the 47 percent of 
Americans who they represent. We must stop 
using the House rules to make it easier to 
plunge the Nation into debt, while hiding raids 
on the Social Security and Medicare trust 
funds. The Republicans’ procedural thumb on 
the scale demeans this institution and reduces 
its credibility. 

Mr. OXLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H. Res. 5, the resolution providing 
for the rules for the House for the 108th 
Congress. This is an important package, with 
important reforms, for both the House and its 
committees. 

In particular, I am pleased to see that the 
House is prepared to accept my proposal that 
committees be permitted postpone some votes 
during markups. As I explained in my testimony 
submitted to the Rules Committee, one 
of the biggest obstacles I faced during my first 
term as Chairman of the Financial Services 
committee was the limited House schedule, 
combined with multiple demands for Committee 
members’ time. When the House is in 
session for 21/2 or 3 days a week, and members 
routinely have 2 and 3 committee assignments, 
we are faced with a situation where it 
is next to impossible for authorizing committees 
to do their work. When the committees 
are unable to complete their work, it’s hard to 
keep the floor in session. It is a vicious cycle, 
and we need new tools to address it. 

That is why I suggested that the House 
change rule XI of the Rules of the House to 
permit committee chairmen to exercise authority 
similar to that of the Speaker in the House 
or the Chairman of the Committee of the 
Whole to postpone ordered record votes to 
permit the ‘‘stacking’’ of multiple votes. This is 

a practice we are all used to when we vote in 
the House or the Committee of the Whole, 
and one that can be easily applied to committee 
practice. 

It is important to note that nothing in this 
rules change will alter committee quorum requirements, 
or curtail other parliamentary options 
available to the Minority. Ultimately, this 
tool will be one of bipartisan convenience, 
rather than a tool to be used by the Majority 
to impose its will on the Minority. 

I am pleased to see that this proposal is included 
in the rules package before the House 
today. I especially want to thank the Majority 
Leader, Mr. DELAY, the speaker, and the 
Chairman of the Rules Committee, the gentleman 
from California, Mr. DREIER, for their 
support of this change. 

I believe this is an important provision in an 
excellent rules package, and I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support it. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the resolution. 


MOTION TO COMMIT OFFERED BY MS. SLAUGHTER 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
offer a motion to commit. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LAHOOD). The Clerk will report the motion. 


The Clerk read as follows: 

Ms. SLAUGHTER moves to commit the resolution 
H. Res. 5 to the Committee on Rules 
with instructions to report the same back to 
the House forthwith with the following 
amendments: 

Amend section 2 of the resolution (relating 
to changes in standing rules) by striking 
amendments to the Rules of the House of 
Representatives relating to— 

(1) postponement of votes in committee; 
(2) requirement of dynamic scoring in 
Ways and Means reports; 
(3) motions to instruct during conference; 
(4) perishable food as a gift; and 
(5) gift ban exemption for charity travel; 
and 
(6) fiduciary relationship for physicians. 
Further amend section 2 of the resolution 
by adding at the end the following new subsection: 


(v) COMMITTEE RATIOS.—Clause 5(a)(1) of 
rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives 
is amended by adding at the end 
the following new sentence: ‘‘The membership 
of each committee (and each subcommittee 
or other subunit thereof) shall reflect 
the ratio of majority to minority party 
members of the House at the beginning of 
the Congress. This requirement shall not 
apply to the Committee on Rules and the 
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.’’. 
Amend section 3 of the resolution by striking 
subsection (a)(4) and subsection (d). 
Amend the resolution by adding at the end 
the following new section: 

SEC. 5. SENSE OF THE HOUSE. 

It is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that it considers protection of the 
rights of the minority party to be able to 
fully participate in the legislative process to 
be of paramount importance and to that end, 
the Republican leadership of the House 
should: 

(1) Pursuant to clause 8(a)(1) of rule XXII 
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, 
ensure that conference reports be available 
to Members at least three calendar days 
prior to consideration, and that in no case 
shall they be brought up for consideration 
without 24 hours availability. 

January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H19 

(2) Seek to reduce the number of waivers of 
the Rules of the House of Representatives 
contained in special order of business resolutions 
reported by the Committee on Rules. 
(3) Seek to reduce the number of bills considered 
by suspension of the rules, especially 
those bills which are of major legislative importance 
as well as any bill that may make 
or authorize appropriations in excess of 
$100,000,000 for any fiscal year. 
(4) Seek to ensure that more alternatives 
or substitutes to legislation be allowed in 
any special order of business resolution reported 
by the Committee on Rules in order 
to ensure that differing viewpoints may be 
debated on the House floor which will open 
the democratic process in the House of Representatives. 
(5) Seek to ensure that the Committee on 
Rules reports more open rules so that Members 
of the Democratic Caucus may offer 
amendments to committee bills, or in those 
cases where structured rules are reported, 
that more Democratic amendments presenting 
significant policy ideas and initiatives 
be included in those amendments made 
eligible for consideration by the rule. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the motion is considered as 
one to commit the resolution to a select 
committee composed of the majority 
leader and the minority leader. 

There was no objection. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is ordered 
on the motion to commit. 

There was no objection.

f 


ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair customarily takes this occasion 
on the opening day of the Congress to 
announce his policies with respect to 
particular aspects of the legislative 
process. The Chair will insert in the 
RECORD announcements by the Speaker 
concerning: first, privileges of the 
floor; second, introduction of bills and 
resolutions; third, unanimous consent 
requests for the consideration of bills 
and resolutions; forth, recognition for 
1-minute speeches, morning hour debate, 
and special orders; fifth, decorum 
in debate; sixth, conduct of votes by 
electronic device; seventh, distribution 
of written material on the House floor; 
and, eighth, use of personal, electronic 
office equipment on the House floor. 

These announcements, where appropriate, 
will reiterate the origins of the 
stated policies. The Speaker intends to 
continue in the 108th Congress the policies 
reflected in these statements. The 
policy announced in the 102nd Congress 
with respect to jurisdictional concepts 
related to clause 5(a) of rule XXI, tax 
and tariff measures, will continue to 
govern but need not be reiterated, as it 
is adequately documented as precedent 
in the House Rules and Manual. 

The announcements referred to follow 
and, without objection, will be 
printed in the RECORD: 

There was no objection. 

1. PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR 
The Chair will make the following announcement 
regarding floor privileges. Rule 
4 strictly limits those persons to whom the 
privileges of the floor during sessions of the 
House are extended, and that rule prohibits 
the Chair from entertaining requests for suspension 
or waiver of that rule. The Speaker’s 
instructions to the former Doorkeeper and 
the Sergeant-at-Arms announced on January 
25, 1983, and on January 21, 1986, regarding 
floor privileges of staff will apply during the 
108th Congress. In accordance with the 
change in this Congress of clause 2(a) of rule 
4 regarding leadership staff floor access, the 
Speaker announces that only designated 
staff approved by the Speaker shall be granted 
the privilege of the floor. The Speaker intends 
that his approval be narrowly granted 
on a bipartisan basis to staff from the major


ity and minority side and only to those staff 
essential to floor activities. 

The rule strictly limits the number of committee 
staff permitted on the floor at one 
time during the consideration of measures 
reported from their committees. This permission 
does not extend to Members’ personal 
staff except when a Member has an 
amendment actually pending. To this end, 
the Chair requests all Members and committee 
staff to cooperate to assure that not 
more than the proper number of staff are on 
the floor, and then only during the actual 
consideration of measures reported from 
their committees. The Chair will again extend 
this admonition to all properly admitted 
majority and minority staff by insisting 
that their presence on the floor, including 
the areas behind the rail, be restricted to 
those periods during which their supervisors 
have specifically requested (and the Speaker 
has approved) their presence. The Chair has 
consulted with and has concurrence of the 
Minority Leader with respect to this policy 
and has directed the Sergeant-at-Arms to assure 
proper enforcement of the rule. The 
Speaker’s policy announced on August 1, 
1996, regarding floor privileges of former 
Members will also apply during the 108th 
Congress. 

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER, JANUARY 25, 

1983 

The SPEAKER. Rule IV strictly limits those 
persons to whom the privileges of the floor 
during sessions of the House are extended, 
and that rule prohibits the Chair from entertaining 
requests for suspension or waiver of 
that rule. As reiterated as recently as August 
22, 1974, by Speaker Albert under the 
principle stated in Deschler’s Procedure, 
chapter 4, section 3.4, the rule strictly limits 
the number of committee staff permitted on 
the floor at one time during the consideration 
of measures reported from their committees. 
This permission does not extend to 
Member’s personal staff except when a Member 
has an amendment actually pending during 
the five-minute rule. To this end, the 
Chair requests all Members and committee 
staff to cooperate to assure that not more 
than the proper number of staff are on the 
floor, and then only during the actual consideration 
of measures reported from their 
committees. The Chair will again extend this 
admonition to all properly admitted majority 
and minority staff by insisting that their 
presence on the floor, including the areas behind 
the rail, be restricted to those periods 
during which their supervisors have specifically 
requested their presence. The Chair 
stated this policy in the 97th Congress, and 
an increasing number of Members have insisted 
on strict enforcement of the rule. The 
Chair has consulted with and has the concurrence 
of the Minority Leader with respect to 
this policy and has directed [the Doorkeeper 
and] the Sergeant-at-Arms to assure proper 
enforcement of the rule. 

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER, JANUARY 21, 

1986 

The SPEAKER. Rule IV strictly limits those 
persons to whom the privileges of the floor 
during sessions of the House are extended, 
and that rule prohibits the Chair from entertaining 
requests for suspension or waiver of 
that rule. As reiterated by the Chair on January 
25, 1983, and January 3, 1985, and as 
stated in chapter 4, section 3.4 of DeschlerBrown’s 
Procedure in the House of Representatives, 
the rule strictly limits the 
number of committee staff on the floor at 
one time during the consideration of measures 
reported from their committees. This 
permission does not extend to Members’ personal 
staff except when a Member’s amendment 
is actually pending during the five-
minute rule. It also does not extend to personal 
staff of Members who are sponsors of 


H22 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

pending bills or who are engaging in special 
orders. The Chair requests the cooperation of 
all Members and committee staff to assure 
that only the proper number of staff are on 
the floor, and then only during the consideration 
of measures reported from their committees. 
The Chair is making this statement 
and reiterating this policy because of concerns 
expressed by many Members about the 
number of committee staff on the floor during 
the last weeks of the first session. The 
Chair requests each chairman, and each 
ranking minority member, to submit to the 
[Doorkeeper] Sergeant-at-Arms a list of staff 
who are to be allowed on the floor during the 
consideration of a measure reported by their 
committee. Each staff person should exchange 
his or her ID for a ‘‘committee staff’’ 
badge which is to be worn while on the floor. 
The Chair has consulted with the Minority 
Leader and will continue to consult with 
him. The Chair has furthermore directed the 
[Doorkeeper and] Sergeant-at-Arms to assure 
proper enforcement of rule IV. 

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER, AUGUST 1, 
1996 

The SPEAKER. The Chair will make a statement. 
On May 25, 1995, the Chair took the opportunity 
to reiterate guidelines on the prohibition 
against former Members exercising 
floor privileges during the consideration of a 
matter in which they have a personal or pecuniary 
interest or are employed or retained 
as a lobbyist. 

Clause 4 of rule IV and the subsequent 
guidelines issued by previous Speakers on 
this matter make it clear that consideration 
of legislative measures is not limited solely 
to those pending before the House. Consideration 
also includes all bills and resolutions 
either which have been called up by a full 
committee or subcommittee or on which 
hearings have been a full committee or subcommittee 
of the House. 

Former Members can be prohibited from 
privileges of the floor, the Speaker’s lobby 
and respective Cloakrooms should it be 
ascertained they have direct interests in legislation 
that is before a subcommittee, full 
committee, or the House. Not only do those 
circumstances prohibit former Members but 
the fact that a former Member is employed 
or retained by a lobbying organization attempting 
to directly or indirectly influence 
pending legislation is cause for prohibiting 
access to the House Chamber. 

First announced by Speaker O’Neill on 
January 6, 1977, again on June 7, 1978, and by 
Speaker Foley in 1994, the guidelines were 
intended to prohibit former Members from 
using their floor privileges under the restrictions 
laid out in this rule. This restriction 
extends not only to the House floor but adjacent 
rooms, the Cloakrooms, and the Speaker’s 
lobby. 

Members who have reason to know that a 
former Member is on the floor inconsistent 
with clause 4 of rule IV should notify the 
Sergeant-at-Arms promptly. 

2. INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS 
The Speaker’s policy announced on January 
3, 1983, will continue to apply in the 
108th Congress. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER, JANUARY 3, 
1983 

The SPEAKER. The Chair would like to 
make a statement concerning the introduction 
and reference of bills and resolutions. 
As Members are aware, they have the privilege 
today of introducing bills. Heretofore on 
the opening day of a new Congress, several 
hundred bills have been introduced. The 
Chair will do his best to refer as many bills 
as possible, but he will ask the indulgence of 
Members if he is unable to refer all the bills 
that may be introduced. Those bills which 

are not referred and do not appear in the 
RECORD as of today will be included in the 
next day’s RECORD and printed with a date as 
of today. 

The Chair has advised all officers and employees 
of the House that are involved in the 
processing of bills that every bill, resolution, 
memorial, petition or other material that is 
placed in the hopper must bear the signature 
of a Member. Where a bill or resolution is 
jointly sponsored, the signature must be 
that of the Member first named thereon. The 
bill clerk is instructed to return to the Member 
any bill which appears in the hopper 
without an original signature. This procedure 
was inaugurated in the 92d Congress. It 
has worked well, and the Chair thinks that it 
is essential to continue this practice to insure 
the integrity of the process by which 
legislation is introduced in the House. 

3. UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUESTS FOR THE 
CONSIDERATION OF BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS 
The Speaker’s policy announced on January 
6, 1999, will continue to apply in the 
108th Congress. 

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER, JANUARY 6, 
1999 

The SPEAKER. The Speaker will continue 
to follow the guidelines recorded in section 
956 of the House Rules and Manual conferring 
recognition for unanimous-consent requests 
for the consideration of bills and resolutions 
only when assured that the majority 
and minority floor leadership and committee 
and subcommittee chairmen and ranking minority 
members have no objection. Consistent 
with those guidelines, and with the 
Chair’s inherent power of recognition under 
clause 2 of rule XVII, the Chair, and any occupant 
of the Chair appointed as Speaker pro 
tempore pursuant to clause 8 of rule I, will 
decline recognition for unanimous-consent 
requests for consideration of bills and resolutions 
without assurances that the request 
has been so cleared. This denial of recognition 
by the Chair will not reflect necessarily 
any personal opposition on the part of the 
Chair to orderly consideration of the matter 
in question, but will reflect the determination 
upon the part of the Chair that orderly 
procedures will be followed; that is, procedures 
involving consultation and agreement 
between floor and committee leadership on 
both sides of the aisle. In addition to unanimous-
consent requests for the consideration 
of bills and resolutions, section 956 of the 
House Rules and Manual also chronicles examples 
where the Speaker applied this policy 
on recognition to other related unanimous-
consent requests, such as requests to consider 
a motion to suspend the rules on a non-
suspension day and requessts to permit consideration 
of nongermane amendments to 
bills. 

As announced by the Speaker, April 26, 
1984, the Chair will entertain unanimous-
consent requests to dispose of Senate amendments 
to House bills on the Speaker’s table 
if made by the chairman of the committee 
with jurisdiction, or by another committee 
member authorized to make the request. 

4. RECOGNITION FOR ONE-MINUTE SPEECHES 
AND SPECIAL ORDERS 
The Speaker’s policy announced on January 
25, 1984, with respect to recognition for 
one-minute speeches will apply during the 
108th Congress with the continued understanding 
that the Chair reserves the authority 
to restrict one-minute speeches at the beginning 
of the legislative day. The Speaker’s 
policy announced in the 104th Congress for 
recognition for ‘‘morning hour’’ debate and 
restricted special-order speeches, announced 
on May 12, 1995, will also continue through 
the 108th Congress with the further clarification 
that reallocations of time within each 

leadership special-order period will be permitted 
with notice to the Chair. 

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER, AUGUST 8, 

1984, RELATIVE TO RECOGNITION FOR ONE


MINUTE SPEECHES 

The SPEAKER. After consultation with and 
concurrence by the Minority Leader, the 
Chair announces that he will institute a new 
policy of recognition for ‘‘one-minute’’ 
speeches and for special order requests. The 
Chair will alternate recognition for one-
minute speeches between majority and minority 
Members, in the order in which they 
seek recognition in the well under present 
practice from the Chair’s right to the Chair’s 
left, with possible exceptions for Members of 
the leadership and Members having business 
requests. The Chair, of course, reserves the 
right to limit one-minute speeches to a certain 
period of time or to a special place in 
the program on any given day, with notice to 
the leadership. 

Uponn consultation with the Minority 
Leader, the Speaker’s policy, which began on 
February 23, 1994, was reiterated on January 
4, 1995, and was supplemented on January 3, 
2001, will continue to apply in the 108th Congress 
as outlined below: 

On Tuesdays, following legislative business, 
the Chair may recognize Members for 
special-order speeches up to midnight, and 
such speeches may not extend beyond midnight. 
On all other days of the week, the 
Chair may recognize Members for special-
order speeches up to four hours after the 
conclusion of five-minute special-order 
speeches. Such speeches may not extend beyond 
the four-hour limit without the permission 
of the Chair, which may be granted only 
with advance consultation between the leaderships 
and notification to the House. However, 
at no time shall the Chair recognize for 
any special-order speeches beyond midnight. 

The Chair will first recognize Members for 
five-minute special-order speeches, alternating 
initially and subsequently between 
the parties regardless of the date the order 
was granted by the House. The Chair will 
then recognize longer special orders speeches. 
A Member recognized for a five-minute 
special-order speech may not be recognized 
for a longer special-order speech. The four-
hour limitation will be divided between the 
majority and minority parties. Each party is 
entitled to reserve its first hour for respective 
leaderships or their designees. Recognition 
will alternate initially and subsequently 
between the parties each day. 

The allocation of time within each party’s 
two-hour period (or shorter period of prorated 
to end by midnight) is to be determined 
by a list submitted to the Chair by 
the respective leaderships. Members may not 
sign up with their leadership for any special-
order speeches earlier than one week prior to 
the special order, and additional guidelines 
may be established for such sign-ups by the 
respective leaderships. 

Pursuant to clause 2(a) of rule V, the television 
cameras will not pan the Chamber, 
but a ‘‘crawl’’ indicating morning hour or 
that the House has completed its legislative 
business and is proceeding with special-order 
speeches will appear on the screen. Other television 
camera adaptations during this period 
may be announced by the Chair. 

The continuation of this format for recognition 
by the Speaker is without prejudice 
to the Speaker’s ultimate power of recognition 
under clause 2 of rule XVII should circumstances 
so warrant. 

5. DECORUM IN DEBATE 
The Chair will make the following announcement 
regarding decorum in debate. It 
is essential that the dignity of the proceedings 
of the House be preserved, not only 
to assure that the House conducts its business 
in an orderly fashion but to permit 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H23 

Members to properly comprehend and participate 
in the business of the House. To this 
end, and in order to permit the Chair to understand 
and to correctly put the question 
on the numerous requests that are made by 
Members, the Chair requests that Members 
and others who have the privileges of the 
floor desist from audible conversation in the 
Chamber while the business of the House is 
being conducted. The Chair would encourage 
all Members to review rule 17 to gain a better 
understanding of the proper rules of decorum 
expected to them, and especially: 

(1) to avoid ‘‘personalities’’ in debate with 
respect to references to other Members, the 
Senate, and the President; 
(2) to address the Chair while standing and 
only when, and not beyond, the time recognized, 
and not to address the television or 
other imagined audience; 
(3) to refrain from passing between the 
Chair and a Member speaking, or directly in 
front of a Member speaking from the well; 
(4) to refrain from smoking in the Chamber; 
(5) to disable wireless phones when entering 
the Chamber; 
(6) to wear appropriate business attire in 
the Chamber; and to generally display the 
same degree of respect to the Chair and 
other Members that every Member is due. 
The Speaker’s policies with respect to decorum 
in debate announced on January 3, 
1991, and January 4, 1995, will apply during 
the 108th Congress. 

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER, JANUARY 3, 
1991 

The SPEAKER. It is essential that the dignity 
of the proceedings of the House be preserved, 
not only to assure that the House 
conducts its business in an orderly fashion 
but to permit Members to properly comprehend 
and participate in the business of 
the House. To this end, and in order to permit 
the Chair to understand and to correctly 
put the question on the numerous requests 
that are made by Members, the Chair requests 
that Members and others who have 
the privileges of the floor desist from audible 
conversation in the Chamber while the business 
of the House is being conducted. The 
Chair would encourage all Members to review 
rule XVII to gain a better understanding 
of the proper rules of decorum expected 
of them, and especially: First, to 
avoid ‘‘personalities’’ in debate with respect 
to references to other Members, the Senate, 
and the President; second, to address the 
Chair while standing and only when and not 
beyond the time recognized, and not to address 
the television or other imagined audience; 
third, to refrain from passing between 
the Chair and the Member speaking, or directly 
in front of a Member speaking from 
the well; fourth, to refrain from smoking in 
the Chamber; and generally to display the 
same degree of respect to the Chair and 
other Members that every Member is due. 

The Speaker’s announcement of January 4, 
1995, will continue to apply in the 108th Congress 
as follows: 

The SPEAKER. The Chair would like all 
Members to be on notice that the Chair intends 
to strictly enforce time limitations on 
debate. Furthermore, the Chair has the authority 
to immediately interrupt Members 
in debate who transgress rule XVII by failing 
to avoid ‘‘personalities’ in debate with respect 
to references to the Senate, the President, 
and other Members, rather than wait 
for Members to complete their remarks. 

Finally, it is not in order to speak disrespectfully 
of the Speaker; and under the 
precedents the sanctions for such violations 
transcend the ordinary requirements for 
timeliness of challenges. This separate treatment 
is recorded in volume 2 of Hinds’ Prece


dents, at section 1248 and was reiterated on 
January 19, 1995. 

6. CONDUCT OF VOTES BY ELECTRIC DEVICE 
The Speaker’s policy announced on January 
4, 1995, will continue through the 108th 
Congress. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair wishes to enunciate 
a clear policy with respect to the conduct 
of electronic votes. 
As Members are aware, clause 2(a) of rule 
XX provides that Members shall have not 
less than 15 minutes in which to answer an 
ordinary [rollcall] record vote or quorum 
call. The rule obviously establishes 15 minutes 
as a minimum. Still, with the cooperation 
of the Members, a vote can easily be 
completed in that time. The events of October 
30, 1991, stand out as proof of this point. 
On that occasion, the House was considering 
a bill in the Committee of the Whole under 
a special rule that placed an overall time 
limit on the amendment process, including 
the time consumed by [rollcalls] record 
votes. The Chair announced, and then strictly 
enforced, a policy of closing electronic 
votes as soon as possible after the guaranteed 
period of 15 minutes. Members appreciated 
and cooperated with the Chair’s enforcement 
of the policy on that occasion. 
The Chair desires that the example of October 
30, 1991, be made the regular practice of 
the House. To that end, the Chair enlists the 
assistance of all Members in avoiding the unnecessary 
loss of time in conducting the 
business of the House. The Chair encourages 
all Members to depart for the Chamber 
promptly upon the appropriate bell and light 
signal. As in recent Congresses, the cloakrooms 
should not forward to the Chair requests 
to hold a vote by electronic device, 
but should simply apprise inquiring Members 
of the time remaining on the voting clock. 
Although no occupant of the Chair would 
prevent a Member who is in the well of the 
Chamber before the announcement of the result 
from casting his or her vote, each occupant 
of the Chair will have the full support 
of the Speaker in striving to close each electronic 
vote at the earliest opportunity. 
Members should not rely on signals relayed 
from outside the Chamber to assume that 
votes will be held open until they arrive in 
the Chamber. 

7. USE OF HANDOUTS ON HOUSE FLOOR 
The Speaker’s policy announced on September 
27, 1995, will continue through 108th 
Congress. 
The SPEAKER. A recent misuse of handouts 
on the floor of the House has been called to 
the attention of the Chair and the House. At 
the bipartisan request of the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct, the Chair announces 
that all handouts distributed on or 
adjacent to the House floor by Members during 
House proceedings must bear the name of 
the member authorizing their distribution. 
In addition, the content of those materials 
must comport with standards of propriety 
applicable to words spoken in debate or inserted 
in the RECORD. Failure to comply with 
this admonition may constitute a breach of 
decorum and may give rise to a question of 
privilege. 
The Chair would also remind Members 
that, pursuant to clause 5 of rule IV, staff 
are prohibited from engaging in efforts in 
the Hall of the House or rooms leading thereto 
to influence Members with regard to the 
legislation being amended. Staff cannot distribute 
handouts. 
In order to enhance the quality of debate 
in the House, the Chair would ask Members 
to minimize the use of handouts. 

8. USE OF EQUIPMENT ON HOUSE FLOOR 
The Speaker’s policy announced on January 
27, 2000, as modified by the change in 

clause 5 of rule XVII in this Congress, will 
continue. All Members and staff are reminded 
of the absolute prohibition contained 
in the last sentence of clause 5 of rule XVII 
against the use of a wireless telephone or 
personal computer upon the floor of the 
House at any time. 

The Chair requests all Members and staff 
wishing to receive or send wireless telephone 
messages to do so outside of the chamber, 
and to deactivate, which means to turn off, 
any audible ring of wireless phones before 
entering the Chamber. To this end, the Chair 
insists upon the cooperation of all Members 
and staff and instructs the Sergeant-at-
Arms, pursuant to clause 3(a) of rule II, to 
enforce this prohibition.

REMEMBERING JOE REMCHO 

(Ms. HARMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) 


Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, this past 
weekend I lost a dear friend and law 
school classmate and Californians lost 
a true champion of public interest and 
civil liberties. Joe Remcho died tragically 
in a helicopter accident. He will 
be sorely missed. I met Joe in law 
school 37 years ago. We became quick 
and close friends. After law school we 
took different paths, but both reveled 
in politics, public interest, and public 
policy. Joe became an acknowledged 
expert in first amendment, election 
law, and civil liberties. As a rookie 
lawyer, he represented soldiers in Saigon 
during the Vietnam War and later 
worked as a staff attorney and lobbyist 
for the ACLU in San Francisco and 
Sacramento. 

He became an advisor to many public 
officials, including California Governor 
Gray Davis, Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 
and me and was sought after for his 
skill, his decency, and his common 
sense. His advocacy greatly influenced 
the redistricting process in California, 
and he brought numerous cases involving 
voter initiatives, term limits, and 
campaign finance. 

Legal titan that he was, I will remember 
Joe as quiet and self-effacing, 

a truly decent individual who eschewed 
headlines and publicity. He always had 
time to give advice to his friends, often 
pro bono. Recently, he helped me with 
a small, but important, family issue. 

People like Joe are rare, but their 
impact great. Joe Remcho’s legacy will 
inspire young lawyers for years to 
come. To his family, friends, clients, 
and other classmates, my family extends 
our deepest condolences.

HONORING FORMER 
CONGRESSMAN WAYNE OWENS 

(Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 

Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the dedication and 
the life of a dear friend of this great 
Chamber, former Congressman Wayne 
Owens. Wayne Owens was an energetic 
Member who served the American people 
faithfully for four terms. As a member 
of the International Relations 
Committee on which I serve, Wayne 
Owens reached across the political 
aisle, committing himself to the peace 
process in the Middle East. 

As the founder of the Center for Middle 
East Peace and Economic Cooperation, 
Wayne Owens brought together 
different leaders from the Middle East 
in his tireless pursuit of a just, lasting, 
and comprehensive peace. 

Mr. Speaker, many were touched by 
Congressman Wayne Owens. I want to 
extend my deepest condolences to his 
wife, Marlene, their two children, their 
grandchildren, and to all of his family 
and friends. Wayne will surely be 
missed.

CELEBRATING JOHN COLLINS’S 
BIRTHDAY 

(Ms. LOFGREN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) 


Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, today is 
a historic day. It is a day that for the 
first time an Italian American, a Californian, 
a woman, was nominated for 
Speaker; but it is historic for me for 
another reason. Today my son, John 
Collins, has turned 18 years old, and 
this is the first time I have ever been 
away from him on his birthday. He insisted 
that I come to Washington 
today. He said I would be letting the 
country down if I did not come to vote 
for NANCY PELOSI. And so I took his advice. 


I wanted to celebrate my son’s birthday 
because he is well known to many 
Members of Congress. He has spent 
many hours on this floor teaching 
Members how to use the computers, arguing 
politics, policy, and philosophy. 
He is a wonderful young man. I am immensely 
proud of him, and I am so glad 
that he has reached this milestone, his 
18th birthday and adulthood. 

REMEMBERING JOE REMCHO 

(Ms. LEE asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 
minute.) 

Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is with a 
deep sense of sadness today that I rise 
to express my sense of sorrow upon 
learning of the death of a great lawyer, 
a courageous civil libertarian, a constituent, 
a very valued and very supportive 
constituent, a devoted husband 
and father, Joe Remcho. 

I had the privilege to know Joe for 
many years and benefited from his advice, 
his counsel, and his steadiness. 
Joe had a keen intellect, a gentle 
heart, and a passion for justice. He 
took on difficult cases because he believed 
in the correctness of the cause, 
not in the glory of the moment. Joe 
Remcho was a humble man. He was a 
humble human being who exemplified 
all of the values we hold so dear. 

My heart is very heavy today. We 
have lost an unsung hero to an untimely 
and sad and tragic death. His 
family—his wife, Ronnie, and his children, 
Morgan and Sam, have lost a great husband 
and father. To his family and to all of 
those who are close to Joe, I just want 
to say may he rest in peace. We send 
our condolences. May God bless him.

JOINING IN HONORING THE 
MEMORY OF JOE REMCHO 

(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1

Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
join my colleagues from California in 
honoring the memory of Joe Remcho, 
who was a great attorney in our State 
and who pled cases before the Supreme 
Court there very successfully. His 
daughter, Morgan, has been an intern 
in my office. So I know the values that 
this family shares and how committed 
they were to public service and for improving 
the lives of everyone in our 
country. Our sympathies go to every 
member of Joe Remcho’s family. He 
was highly respected in the State of 
California. His death is a tragedy for 
many of us. He will be sorely missed, 
and I hope it is a comfort to his family 
that so many people share their loss 
and are praying for them at this sad 
time and that his passing has been recorded 
by the California Members of 
Congress in this very distinguished 
House of Representatives.

people of California well. As long as I 
can remember during my stint in the 
Senate, Joe Remcho has been there,

SPECIAL ORDERS 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LAHOOD). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 7, 2003, and 
under a previous order of the House, 
the following Members will be recognized 
for 5 minutes each. 

f 


THE MEDICARE FRAUD PREVENTION 
AND ENFORCEMENT ACT 
OF 2003, THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL 
LEAVE CLARIFICATION ACT 
OF 2003, AND THE ENERGY AND 
SCIENCE RESEARCH INVESTMENT 
ACT OF 2003 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a 
previous order of the House, the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Mrs. BIGGERT) is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 

Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce three bills that address 
issues affecting our health care 
system, our workplace, and the future 
of science research in the United 
States. 

Topping our agenda as we begin this 
first day of the 108th Congress are the 
serious challenges facing our Medicare 
system: enacting a prescription drug 
benefit for seniors and providing fair 
and adequate reimbursement for physicians, 
hospitals, and care facilities in 
my home State of Illinois and across 
the Nation. 

So the first bill that I introduce 
today is one that will make it easier to 
provide this funding by cracking down 
on the waste, fraud, and abuse that 
drain more than $12 billion a year from 
the Medicare system. 

The Medicare Fraud Prevention and 
Enforcement Act of 2003 will put an end 
to that theft. It will strengthen the 
Medicare enrollment process, expand 
certain standards of participation, and 
reduce erroneous payments. Perhaps 
most importantly, it gives criminal investigators 
at the Department of 
Health and Human Services the Federal 
law enforcement tools to help 
them pursue and prosecute health care 
swindlers. 

The time to modernize Medicare is 
not next week, not next month or next 
year; the time is now. But true reform 
will not be achieved without first protecting 
Medicare from fraud and scandalous 
exploitation. 

The second bill I introduce today, the 
Family and Medical Leave Clarification 
Act of 2003, will make a good act 
work even better for our Nation’s 

workers and employers. What do I 
mean by that? Well, since its enactment 
in 1993, the Family and Medical 
Leave Act, or FMLA, has brought 
peace of mind and job security during 
critical times to thousands of workers 
and their families. That is a good 
thing. But along with this good thing 
has come the bad: conflict with existing 
workplace policies, misinterpretations, 
and misapplications of the law, 
intrusions into the privacy of employees, 
and other consequences that were 
never anticipated or intended by Congress. 
While none of us would say that 
FMLA is broken, all of us, employees 
and employers alike, must recognize 
that it should be fixed. 

How will my bill fix the unintended 
and unwanted consequences of FMLA? 

First, it clarifies what is now regarded 
as a confusing definition of a 
‘‘serious health condition.’’ 

Second, it allows for employees to request 
leave time in blocks of at least 4 
hours so that they have enough time to 
take care of their business without 
feeling rushed to return to the office. 
At the same time, it cuts down on the 
paperwork that employers must process 
and the intrusive questions they 
must ask employees before granting 
leave. 

Third, it allows employers to require 
employees to choose whether to take 
unpaid leave under FMLA or a paid 
leave of absence under a collective bargaining 
agreement. It provides an incentive 
for employers who offer sick 
leave to continue to do so while providing 
a disincentive for those who are 
considering termination of such employee 
friendly plans. 

The FMLA Clarification Act is a reasonable 
measure and fair response to 
many of the concerns raised by workers 
and employers around the country. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting 
it. 

Last but not least, I introduce today 
the Energy and Science Research Investment 
Act, which recognizes the urgent 
need to finance and manage well 
our Nation’s basic research initiatives. 

Over the past 5 years, Federal funding 
for medical research has nearly 
doubled, yet funding for research in the 
physical sciences has remained stagnant 
at 1990 levels. 

The Energy and Science Research Investment 
Act will provide additional 
resources to the Department of Energy’s 
Office of Science and make organizational 
changes that will enhance the 
accountability and oversight of energy 
research and science programs at the 
DOE. 

Mr. Speaker, I thank those who have 
signed on as original cosponsors of 
these bills, and I urge others to join us 
in becoming cosponsors of these three 
key measures.

THREAT REDUCTION 
IMPLEMENTATION ACT OF 2003 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a 
previous order of the House, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. SCHIFF) is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 

Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, earlier 
today, I introduced the Threat Reduction 
Implementation Act of 2003, granting 
the President permanent waiver 
authority over Nunn-Lugar Cooperative 
Threat Reduction certification requirements 
to prevent dangerous 
delays in this critical defense program. 
Unnecessary restrictions and delays in 
funding Nunn-Lugar put Americans at 
risk of potential attacks using smuggled 
Russian chemical, biological, or 
nuclear weapons technology or material. 


The terrorist attacks of September 11 
fundamentally changed the way we 
think of national security and protecting 
the homeland. Unlike adversaries 
of the past, our enemies today 
not only utilize untraditional weapons 
in their war of terror, but also are 
seeking access to new and even more 
destructive weapons, such as chemical, 
biological, and nuclear weapons. 

Twelve years ago, the Nunn-Lugar 
Cooperative Threat Reduction Program 
was born out of the necessity to ensure 
that the nuclear arsenal of the Soviet 
Union would not fall into the wrong 
hands as the Soviet empire was coming 
apart. While much has been done to 
dismantle these weapons, continuing 
economic and social weaknesses in 
Russia, coupled with an eroding early 
warning system, poorly secured Russian 
weapons materials, and poorly 
paid Russian weapons scientists and security 
personnel, increase the threat of 
mass destruction on an unprecedented 
scale. 

Unfortunately, every year opponents 
of the CTR program wage a campaign 
to slow down or even block funds for 
the continuation of U.S. efforts in Russia 
to monitor and reduce weapons-usable 
nuclear material and other weapons 
of mass destruction. While accountability 
and oversight are necessary to 
make sure that Nunn-Lugar funds are 
serving their intended purpose, recurrent 
delays owing to outdated certification 
requirements have proven detrimental 
to our ability to protect the 
homeland. 

During the fiscal year 2003 Defense 
authorization and appropriation debates, 
the administration requested 
permanent waiver authority over many 
certification requirements in order to 
permit elements of the program to go 
forward. After a drawn out debate, conferees 
ended up granting a 3-year waiver 
on the Nunn-Lugar certification requirements 
and a 1-year waiver for the 
construction of a chemical weapons 
construction facility in Shchuchye, 
Russia. Avoiding lengthy and unnecessary 
delays in the Nunn-Lugar program 


H26 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

and specifically with the chemical 
weapons elimination project in Russia, 
it is in the strong national interest of 
the United States and justifies granting 
the President permanent waiver 
authority. With the weapons at 
Shchuchye reportedly able to kill the 
world’s population some 20 times over, 
the continued, insecure existence of 
these highly dangerous and portable 
weapons is a direct threat to the American 
people. 

Securing Russia’s arsenal is a massive 
challenge, but not an impossible 
one. While the cost of a terrorist attack 
on the United States involving 
Russian expertise or smuggled Russian 
nuclear, chemical, or biological weapon 
materials are potentially staggering, 
funding for the simple measures that 
can prevent these attacks is both sensible 
and urgent. Robust, uninterrupted 
funding of this very critical program 
would accelerate the progress of 
reducing these attacks on the United 
States and help the Russian Federation 
secure its weapons stockpile. 

Although the President has broad authority 
to use force in the war on terrorism, 
ironically he is significantly 
constrained in using cooperative means 
to destroy these weapons of mass destruction. 
Granting the President permanent 
waiver authority over Nunn-
Lugar certification requirements will 
avoid dangerous delays in this critical 
defense program and prevent Russia’s 
weapons of mass destruction from falling 
into the wrong hands. 

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, 
the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. SPRATT), the gentlewoman 
from California (Mrs. 
TAUSCHER), the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. EDWARDS), the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. CROWLEY), the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. 
MCDERMOTT), the gentleman from California 
(Mr. BERMAN), and the gentleman 
from Massachusetts (Mr. 
FRANK), who joined me today as original 
cosponsors of this bill. I would like 
to also thank Senator RICHARD LUGAR 
and former Senator Sam Nunn for their 
foresight and leadership on this issue. I 
look forward to working with my colleagues 
during this Congress on this 
very important homeland security 
issue.

previous order of the House, the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. MALONEY)

HISTORIC MOMENTS FOR THE 

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a 
previous order of the House, the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. 
MILLENDER-MCDONALD) is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 

Ms. MILLENDER-MCDONALD. Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure that my colleagues 
join me in welcoming the 54 new Mem


bers to this august body and the returning 
Members who are charged with 
helping to chart the course for these 
new Members, knowing that they have 
a very complex and awesome responsibility. 
But, Mr. Speaker, today has 
been an historic day for us. We have 
seen, for the first time ever a woman, 
a Democratic woman, whose name was 
put in nomination for the Speakership 
of the U.S. House of Representatives, 
and another woman who became the 
chairwoman of the congressional Republican 
Conference. Those are historic 
moments for us, Mr. Speaker, and as 
the Democratic chair of the Women’s 
Caucus, I am very much enjoyous of 
this momentous occasion that has 
brought these two women front and 
center to leadership roles. 

So as we convene this 108th Congress, 
we should also pause to look at the 
other historic notes that were taken 
today in this esteemed body, as we convened 
with two sibling pairs of Members 
that have come to this House. The 
SANCHEZ sisters from California and 
the DIAZ-BALART brothers from Florida 
will serve simultaneously as teams in 
this Congress, representing diverse districts 
on opposite coasts of this great 
country. My esteemed colleagues, with 
their formidable backgrounds, are all 
accomplished in their own rights, coming 
from immigrant families and immigrant 
backgrounds who have truly 
lived the American dream with hard 
work, as productive members of society, 
giving back and serving the people 
of their communities. They have now 
been elected to the U.S. Congress. 

The senior sister, the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LORETTA 
SANCHEZ), has an MBA from American 
University and is an accomplished 
businesswoman, assisting municipalities 
and private companies in strategic 
planning and capital acquisition. The 
State of California selected her to independently 
review the financial status 
of Orange County’s first toll road to 
save about $300 million in financing 
costs. The junior sister, the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LINDA 
SA´ NCHEZ), with her law degree from 
UCLA, was a civil rights lawyer and 
labor activist heading up the Orange 
County AFL–CIO. 

The senior brother, the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. LINCOLN DIAZBALART), 
has a law degree from Cleveland, 
Ohio’s Case Western Reserve University, 
which he used to provide free 
legal service to the poor. The junior 
brother, the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. MARIO DIAZ-BALART), served in the 
Florida State Legislature for 14 years 
before being elected to serve in this 
Chamber. 

Mr. Speaker, let us welcome all of 
these outstanding freshman Members, 
these pairs of siblings who have come 
to serve their respective districts, but 
who have made history, along with the 
two outstanding women, and may we 
all embrace them as they take their 
rightful roles. I know that all of us salute 
the Latino community, because 

they are proud of today’s historic 
events, as well as all Americans are 
proud of these pairs of siblings.

LEGISLATIVE ISSUES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a 
previous order of the House, the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON-LEE) 
is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, happy New Year, and congratulations 
to all of my colleagues for 
the beginning of the 108th Congress. 
I believe that we have an opportunity 
as we serve in the United States Congress 
to make things better and, therefore, 
I would like to speak this afternoon 
on the attempt to honor some 
who I believe have made this world a 
better place. So today I will be filing a 
resolution to express the sense of Congress 
for a commemorative postage 
stamp in honor of the late George 
Thomas ‘‘Mickey’’ Leland, one of our 
colleagues who fought so valiantly to 
avoid hunger in this world. As I stand 
here, we are recognizing the emerging 
famine in Ethiopia, which was one of 
the reasons that Congressman Leland 
was in Ethiopia in 1989, to be able to 
thwart the enormous hunger that that 
Nation was facing. It will be our challenge 
in this Congress to honor him, 
but to as well take up the cause that he 
so valiantly attempted in his work to 
avoid or to stamp out hunger in the 
world. 

b1645 

I hope, as we look at the funding and 
the issues before us, we will not forget 
that we are in fact our brothers’ and 
sisters’ keepers. 

In addition, I am filing today a resolution 
to name the Department of Veterans 
Affairs in Houston Hospital as 
the Michael E. DeBakey Department of 
Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Michael 
E. DeBakey, a famous and renowned 
heart surgeon, was also a renowned, 
valiant fighter for America in 
World War II. So we believe that this 
would be an appropriate honoring of 
such an outstanding leader. 

I also intend to file today a bill that 
will emphasize more mental health 
services for children and to provide 
more support for our community mental 
health centers around the Nation. 
We lost a valiant soldier on behalf of 
the mental health needs of this Nation 
last year, our dear friend, former Senator 
Paul Wellstone. In his honor I believe 
that we should continue to fight 
for the equality of health care as it relates 
to mental health services, and 
particularly I believe that we should 
advocate for the children of this land 
to have access to mental health services. 


Over the last couple of years, as the 
co-Chair and Chair of the Congressional 
Children’s Caucus, my colleague, 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
ROS-LEHTINEN), and myself have tried 
to focus on the needs of children in 
America. It has been appalling to 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H27 

watch in several States the tragedy of 
lost children by the children’s protective 
services. 

I have already filed a bill dealing 
with infant abandonment in hospitals, 
and also the question of hospitals attending 
to the information or trying to 
find family members of abandoned children 
that may be left, or newborn babies 
that may be left in hospitals. We 
will be looking to file a bill dealing 
with and addressing the question of 
children’s protective services across 
the Nation. 

Let me first of all say that there are 
many who do good work as part of the 
system of protecting our children in 
States across the Nation. Let me applaud 
those individuals. Particularly, I 
would like to cite the Harris County 
Children’s Protective Services that had 
worked with me so valiantly on the 
issue of baby abandonment and other 
child protection issues. 

But when there is fault and error, 
when there is a circumstance such as 
that that generated the loss of life of a 
7-year-old boy in New Jersey, and the 
starvation of two very young children, 
we need to address the question of accountability 
by our children’s protective 
services across the Nation. 

So I will be filing legislation to require 
an accounting of the children 
that are under their jurisdiction, an 
annual reporting, and a knowledge of 
whose possession those children are in. 
Our children are our most precious resource, 
and therefore we need to include 
legislation to protect them at 
every opportunity that we have. 

Mr. Speaker, I will also be filing two 
private bills, and have filed them, one 
dealing with Gao Zhan, an outstanding 
academic from China, who still at this 
point has not received her citizenship. 
She was held against her will in China 
just a few months ago. We are delighted 
that she is released, and her 
husband and son are citizens; and I 
hope we will consider her plight. 

Let me also say, Mr. Speaker, that I 
am filing a private bill on behalf of the 
Kesbeh family, who have been in this 
country for almost 12 years and have 
made every effort to become citizens, 
and in fact have a 9-year-old daughter. 
We hope that under the laws of this 
land their case can be considered and 
that we will treat them fairly under 
our laws. 

Mr. Speaker, I believe we are here to 
work, and I hope that my colleagues 
will join me in supporting the legislative 
initiative that I have put forward 
and, as well, that we will find compromise 
and opportunity to work with 
those who are unemployed and to provide 
an outstanding economic stimulus 
package.

TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE 

WAYNE OWENS, FORMER MEM


BER OF CONGRESS FROM UTAH 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LAHOOD). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 7, 2003, the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. CANNON) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the designee 
of the majority leader. 

Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, as dean 
of the Utah delegation, it is my sad 
duty to announce to the House the 
passing of the Honorable Wayne Owens, 
a former Member of this body and a 
good friend to many of us. 

Wayne died unexpectedly just before 
Christmas of a massive heart attack 
while walking on the beach in Tel 
Aviv, Israel, at the conclusion of a 
peace-seeking trip to several countries 
in the Middle East. He was only 65 
years old. 

That Wayne Owens would be involved 
in that kind of activity as his life 
ended is no surprise to those of us who 
knew him. He spent a significant part 
of his life trying to bring about accommodation 
of the interests and passions 
plaguing that part of the world. 

Wayne Owens served in this House 
from 1973 to 1975 and again from 1987 to 
1993, representing the people of the 
Second District of Utah. His political 
career inspired a generation of young 
people with his political idealism. He 
was a Democrat and he and I differed 
on many policy issues, but we never 
disagreed on the need for the involvement 
of the electorate, and especially 
young people, in the art and science of 
making law. In fact, I might say that 
while we disagreed on almost every 
issue, he was never, and I hope I also 
was never, disagreeable. 

In the House, Wayne served on the 
Committee on the Judiciary, and we 
had parallel careers in that he inves


tigated one Republican President and I, 
early in my career, investigated another 
Democratic President. Later, he 
served on the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs, and it was his service there 
that led to his lifelong concern for the 
people of the Middle East and to his efforts 
to mediate their conflicts. He created 
the Center for Middle East Peace 
and Economic Cooperation to assist in 
that effort. 

At the funeral service held for Wayne 
Owens, Gordon B. Hinckley, president 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter 
Day Saints, said of him: ‘‘Any man who 
is engaged in the cause of peace is engaged 
in the cause of Christ. By that 
measure, Wayne was a true Christian.’’ 

The world is poorer for his passing. I 
join my colleagues in extending to his 
wife, Marlene, and his children and 
grandchildren our deepest sympathy 
for his loss, and our profound respect 
for their husband, father, and grandfather. 
We will miss him. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that Members have 
5 days to submit tributes to their 
former colleague. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Utah? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
HINCHEY). 

Mr. HINCHEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding to me, and 
thank him for providing me an opportunity 
to express my deep affection and 
respect for Wayne Owens and his memory. 


I can say that we were very good 
friends, even though our tenure here in 
the House of Representatives did not 
coincide. He was leaving for the second 
time, actually, as I was coming in in 
1993; but we were associated by virtue 
of the fact that we were interested in 
similar issues. Two of those issues 
most principally were the protection 
and preservation of open space in the 
State of Utah and peace in the Middle 
East. 

It was because of the initiative of 
Wayne Owens that I became the sponsor 
of a very significant piece of legislation 
here in the House of Representatives 
which would set aside a vast 
amount of publicly owned land in the 
State of Utah to be incorporated within 
that property owned by the Federal 
Government which is declared wilderness; 
in other words, affording it the 
highest level of protection for today 
and for future generations. 

Future generations is what Wayne 
Owens often had in mind, whether he 
was working on environmental issues 
or working with young people in his 
own State of Utah or elsewhere. He was 
also, as we all know, dedicated to the 
idea of bringing about peace in the 
Middle East between Israelis and Palestinians 
and others in that part of the 
world. 

He first developed this intense interest 
as a result of his missionary work 


H28 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

for the Mormon Church. He was, of 
course, a devout Mormon, and had, as 
all Mormons do, performed significant 
missionary work on behalf of the Mormon 
Church. It was in that cause that 
he first became intimately acquainted 
with the details and difficulties of the 
circumstances that prevail, and that 
have prevailed, for some time in the 
Middle East, and which led him to establish 
the Center for Middle East 
Peace, which later became the Center 
for Middle East Peace and Economic 
Development. 

As the director of that center, he led 
many of us in this Congress on numerous 
trips to that part of the world, at 
least for two reasons: to better acquaint 
Members of Congress with the 
circumstances that prevail in Israel 
and the surrounding area, and also to 
enlist us in his work to bring about a 
peaceful settlement to the political difficulties 
that prevail there. 

With Wayne Owens I have had the opportunity 
to be in Israel on numerous 
occasions; also in Beirut, and in Damascus; 
throughout the southern Mediterranean: 
in Tunisia and Morocco, 
Egypt, Algeria; and throughout the 
Saudi Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf 
States, as well. 

Always, Wayne was well received by 
the political leaders of all of those 
countries. They were well acquainted 
with him, they liked him personally, 
they understood the devotion and intensity 
that he brought to his work, 
and they respected him deeply for all of 
that. 

So whenever any of us traveled with 
Wayne, we were always treated well by 
everyone with whom we came into contact, 
not only because we were Members 
of the Congress, but also because 
we were traveling with Wayne Owens, 
who they knew and respected in the 
way that I have just described. 

I and everyone who knew him were 
deeply shocked at his loss, by the suddenness 
of his death. He was a man of 
such energy and vitality we all could 
not help but think that he would go on 
for a long, long time doing the very 
good work that he has done. It is still 
hard to believe that he has been taken 
from us in the midst of his work; but so 
it is, and so we miss him and respect 
him. 

I believe that all of us will continue 
to show that respect by continuing our 
devotion to the cause to which he in 
fact devoted his life, and that is, the 
cause of bringing peace to the Middle 
East. 

I thank Wayne Owens, and I want to 
also at this moment express my deep 
appreciation to his wife and his family, 
who suffered, I guess is the best way to 
put it, his work. They allowed him to 
carry it on. They knew he was doing, in 
effect, the Lord’s work. He was doing 
work that they appreciated and understood. 
I want to express my appreciation 
to his wife and family for allowing 
him to do all the good things that he 
did. 

We miss him very, very deeply, we 
admire him, and we feel deeply his loss. 

Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I first 
would like to thank the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. HINCHEY) for his 
comments. He and I worked closely together 
on issues that he has picked up 
on, public lands in Utah, from Mr. 
Owens; and I want to thank him for his 
kind words to our colleague. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. WEXLER). 

Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding to me. It is 
with a heavy heart that I rise today to 
honor an outstanding visionary leader, 
former Member of Congress, and dear 
friend, Wayne Owens. Today is a sad 
day in the Middle East and here in our 
own country, not only because violence 
and terror continue unabated, but also 
because one of the greatest believers 
and promoters of peace in the Middle 
East has passed. That man was Wayne 
Owens. 

It is with profound respect, admiration, 
and sadness that I wish to pay 
tribute to him today. 

b1700 
In my tenure as a Member of Congress 
I have traveled with Wayne to 
the Middle East on numerous occasions, 
witnessing firsthand his remarkable 
ability to bridge the gap between 
international leaders and promote dialogue, 
understanding and accord. 
Wayne was the quintessential peacemaker 
because he never wavered in his 
steadfast dedication and commitment 
to the future of the Middle East. His 
expertise on this issue was the focus of 
his professional life, from his years in 
the House of Representatives, to his 
time as the President and driving force 
behind the Center for Middle East 
peace. Wayne’s unique efforts promoted 
understanding and communication 
in a time of great uncertainty and 
despair in the Middle East. At a time 
when hostility, hatred and terror permeated 
current events, Wayne would 
travel to the epicenter of the conflict 
to encourage diplomacy and peace. 
At a time when no one could envision 
a resolution to the most contentious 
issues in the Middle East, Wayne consistently 
offered creative answers and 
an optimistic spin. At a time when 
doors began to close in the region, 
Wayne dedicated the end of his life to 
opening the channels of peace, bringing 
American ideals to the region, and offering 
a glimmer of hope to leaders and 
people in the Middle East. 
Wayne Owens was a truly remarkable 
man who leaves behind a legacy of 
compassion, leadership and hope. 
Wayne was a beautiful soul, an extremely 
kind man who loved his family 
and cherished life dearly. I wish to convey 
my deepest condolences to his wife 
Marlene and the rest of Wayne’s family 
and offer my wholehearted sympathy 
at this most difficult time. Wayne’s 
contributions to history will be forever 
remembered as will his unyielding 
dream of harmony and peace. Wayne, 
you will be missed by those who care 
for you, and I consider myself one that 

thinks of you like a brother, an older 
brother, a very dear person and we will 
all miss you very, very much. 

Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, 
want to thank the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. WEXLER) for his kind 
words. 

I will submit for the record a statement 
by the gentleman from California 
(Mr. BERMAN). If I may take a moment 
to summarize what the gentleman from 
California (Mr. BERMAN) said. His ideas 
are important. 

The gentleman from California (Mr. 
BERMAN) served with Mr. Owens in the 
House and pointed out in his comments 
that Mr. Owens was remarkable for the 
broad range of issues with which he 
dealt. 

He goes on to say that Mr. Owens was 
a very effective legislator, and after he 
left Congress that he was deeply involved 
in the Middle East peace process. 
One of the reasons why he was so 
effective, according to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. BERMAN), is that 
all sides accepted him as an honest 
broker. And finally, he never stopped 
believing that peace was possible even 
in the most difficult times recently in 
the Middle East. 

Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from New Mexico (Mr. UDALL). 

Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. CANNON) for all he has done 
in organizing these words today on the 
floor for Wayne Owens. 

I just wanted to rise today to say a 
few words about Wayne Owens and his 
service to the United States of America. 
He was a fine public servant. Many 
will talk and some have already about 
his tireless efforts for Middle East 
peace, but Wayne had an extensive legislative 
record here in the House of 
Representatives. He fought tirelessly 
to restore endangered species across 
the West. And the issue that I specifically 
would like to talk about today is 
his bringing justice to the Colorado 
plateau uranium miners. 

Wayne saw this as a situation with 
the Colorado uranium miners that had 
to have justice be brought to the situation. 
And what happened is these uranium 
miners went into mines on the 
Colorado plateau, worked in very dangerous, 
dirty air mines. There were 
high radon levels, as the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. CANNON) knows. He has 
worked on this very issue. The government 
knew these levels were very high. 
Government doctors did reports and 
doctors issued studies, but nobody told 
the uranium miners that there was 
really a problem. And so many years 
they continued to work in these uranium 
mines, 10 or 15 years in these 
dirty air mines. 

As many of us know, when you contract 
radon in a uranium mine and it is 
at high levels what ends up happening 
is 10 or 15 years down the line you get 
lung cancer, and that is in fact what 
happened on the Colorado plateau, an 
epidemic of lung cancer. Lawsuits were 
brought on behalf of these uranium 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H29 

miners but many of them were unsuccessful. 
My father was one of the ones, 
Stewart Udall, that brought many of 
the lawsuits and represented the miners. 
He just told me the other day when 
we learned of Wayne’s death, he said, if 
it had not been for Wayne at that particular 
point when the miners lost 
their lawsuits, when the families were 
discouraged, when they thought there 
was going to be no justice, it was 
Wayne Owens that picked up the fight. 
And he went out and held hearings and 
he involved TED KENNEDY and BARNEY 
FRANK and the Committee on the Judiciary 
and brought justice to this situation 
by helping pass a piece of legislation 
known as the Radiation Exposure 
Compensation Act. And many families 
today in Utah and across the Colorado 
plateau are now in much better shape 
because of Wayne Owens’ efforts on 
that piece of legislation. 

All of us here in the House of Representatives, 
I believe, miss Wayne 
very much and miss his contributions. 
We want to give our heartfelt condolences 
to his wife Marlene and his family, 
and we want to thank Wayne for 
his service, his great service to the 
country. 

Mr. CANNON. As the gentleman from 
New Mexico (Mr. UDALL) knows, my 
first job as a lawyer, Madam Speaker, 
was with his father working on these 
very cases that we are talking about. It 
was one of the great experiences of my 
life, and it is one of many of the areas 
where Congressman Owens and I had a 
great deal in common. 

I came to represent many of the people 
who were effected by the radon 
from the uranium mines. In fact, there 
is a whole town of widows, Minersville, 
Utah, which was part of my district 
until recently. So this has been a very 
important part of my life and one of 
reasons I appreciate the life and service 
of Mr. OWENS. 

Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. MORAN). 

Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague 
from Utah for yielding to me. I 
knew Wayne, particularly having had 
the opportunity to travel to the Middle 
East with him, and one thing that 
struck anyone who got to know him 
was how profoundly proud he was of 
having served in this institution. He 
served as an aide to Bobby Kennedy 
and to others. He worked in a number 
of political campaigns. Politics was his 
life. But he saw politics as an instrument 
to do good, to make lasting and 
positive change. 

His colleagues from Utah have talked 
about the environmental progress that 
he was able to achieve. He did any 
number of things in bringing diverse 
groups together. But I have to believe 
as his lifelong career pursuit, at least 
the latter part of his life, was dedicated 
to bringing about peace in the Middle 
East. He founded the Center for Middle 
East Peace and Economic Cooperation. 

He took a great many risks, not just 
personally and politically, but even 

physically. He had tremendous courage. 
That courage came from the personal 
belief in what he was doing. He 
put his own safety far below the importance 
of what he knew needed to be 
done in bringing about peace and reconciliation 
in one of the world’s most 
conflicted parts. He found ways to 
build bridges. He loved people on both 
sides and found that commonality and 
worked on that commonality. 

And I want to quote from somebody 
that not only founded the Center for 
Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation 
but was a very close friend of 
Wayne’s, an intimate friend of 
Wayne’s. They shared objectives. They 
loved each other. And that is Danny 
Abraham. Danny sent out a letter from 
the Center for Middle East Peace and 
Economic Cooperation. I want to quote 
from it. He says with regard to Wayne, 
‘‘He was respected, loved and cherished 
by all who knew him. Wayne’s single-
minded devotion to continued dialogue 
and peace between Israelis and Arabs 
in the Middle East, even in the most 
challenging of circumstances, gave us 
the hope and courage we could have 
never found on our own. Wayne never 
faltered from his dream that one day 
Israelis and Arabs would live in peace 
and he had the magic, the gift of nurturing 
that dream in everyone he met. 
My beloved friend Wayne was a true 
servant of peace and he lived and died 
serving humanity. May Wayne Owens’ 
life, his dedication and belief in us not 
be wasted. Together we must recommit 
ourselves to the pursuit of peace.’’ 

That will be Wayne’s legacy, to help 
us recommit ourselves in the pursuit of 
the noblest objectives that he committed 
his life to. Again I want to 
thank my friend and colleague from 
Utah (Mr. CANNON). Let us memorialize 
Wayne in the actions that we take to 
further the vision that he had for 
peace, not only in the Middle East but 
throughout the world. 

Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank my friend and colleague, 
the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. MORAN), for his kind words with 
regard to my dear friend, Mr. Owens. 

Madam Speaker, I would like to yield 
to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
DAVIS). 

Mr. DAVIS of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding 
to me. I had just before Christmas returned 
to Florida from a 10-day trip to 
the Middle East with Wayne Owens and 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. PRICE), who will speak shortly, as 
well as Danny Abraham with the Center. 
And I wanted to start by thanking 
Wayne’s family and the people of Utah 
for sharing him with us, citizens of the 
United States, Members of Congress, 
the many people who were touched by 
Wayne. 

Wayne was a wonderful husband, a 
wonderful father, a wonderful citizen 
and he gave so much because the people 
of Utah saw fit to send him to Congress 
to equip him with the knowledge 
that he used through the last minute of 
his life. 

Wayne was one of the most selfless 
people I had met who served in this 
body. He had a wonderful sense of 
humor, a very strong sense of conviction, 
and something that I really came 
to appreciate more in the most recent 
trip to the Middle East, just a certain 
genius about him, a remarkable level 
of insight into people, people of all 
kinds, people who never could have 
been in the same room with one another, 
on different sides of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict, on different sides 
of other issues that separated us from 
countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia. 

But Wayne truly believed in people 
and I think did his best to see the best 
in everyone he met and to draw that 
out, and I think that Wayne played a 
very important role in the diplomacy 
of this country in having some painfully 
direct and difficult conversations 
with the heads of states in some of 
these Arab nations and having some 
very frank and constructive conversations 
with the officials in the Israeli 
government. 

Wayne Owens knew an awful lot 
about the Middle East and really would 
have been entitled to have been incredibly 
very cynical about what is happening 
over there right now, even hopeless, 
as many well-intentioned wise 
people are. But Wayne, like a lot of 
leaders who have made this country 
great and the world great, was an incurable 
optimist, and he til his dying 
day never stopped radiating the hope 
that he had that the better angels, as 
Abraham Lincoln would have put it, of 
all the people he had come in contact 
with would ultimately prevail, and 
that the United States would in the 
end play an important role in bringing 
about peace and tranquility in the 
Arab-Israeli dispute. 

I always thought to myself that if 
there ever had been or could be an election 
to choose the mayor of the Middle 
East, my candidate would have been 
Wayne Owens. In the last trip that the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
PRICE) and I took, at every major airport 
we passed through in the Middle 
East, Wayne ran into people that knew 
him, respected him, who loved him, 
who had not seen him in 10 years because 
Wayne was one of those people 
that you never forgot. 

I have to say that as a United States 
citizen, I was proud and will always be 
proud not just to call Wayne Owens my 
friend and someone who has helped develop 
me, but someone who I think represented 
the best things about our 
country in a part of the world where 
people are judging us very carefully, to 
see what we are made of and whether 
we really live up to the things that we 
say our country stands for because 
Wayne represented the very best of this 
country.

He has set a standard for diplomacy 
that we will all have to work very hard 
to live up to. 
Wayne Owens’ untimely death on the 
shores of Tel Aviv is tragic but perhaps 


H30 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

the place where Wayne would have chosen, 
in between the United States, his 
beloved home of Utah, and on the shore 
of a country he loved dearly. 

Wayne’s tragic, premature death 
gives us another reason to do what 
Wayne Owens would have asked us to 
do if he were standing here today, and 
that is, to recommit ourselves to peace 
in the Middle East, to serve as an honest 
broker, to stand for the values that 
have helped this country get to where 
it is today, to bring about a Palestinian 
state that respects the security 
of Israel, to help the Palestinians find 
a way to govern themselves, bring the 
terror to an end and give the Israelis 
the chance to live the dream they have 
always had in that part of the world. 

Let us renew ourselves to the cause 
of peace in the Middle East. It is another 
way that we can honor Wayne 
Owens, and I want to thank the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. CANNON) and 
the gentleman from Utah (Mr. MATHESON) 
for all the things they have done 
in Utah today and will be doing in the 
future to honor Wayne Owens, and we 
are all blessed in that. 

Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Florida, and 
I would now yield to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE). 

Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
calling this Special Order today and for 
his and the gentleman from Utah’s (Mr. 
MATHESON) efforts to make certain colleagues 
have an opportunity to pay 
tribute to our dear friend Wayne 
Owens. 

Madam Speaker, Wayne Owens bade 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
DAVIS) and me farewell on December 
17th after we had traveled through the 
Middle East together for 7 intense 
days. He planned to take that same 
flight the next evening. But the next 
day Wayne suffered a massive heart attack, 
collapsed and died while walking 
on the beach in Tel Aviv. 

Our shock and consternation upon 
hearing the news a mere 24 hours after 
he had put us on that flight were acute, 
but these emotions were widely shared 
among Wayne’s many friends, the Utah 
constituents he served during two distinguished 
stints in the United States 
House of Representatives, and the admirers 
of his path-breaking work since 
1989 with the Center for Middle East 
Peace and Economic Cooperation. 

Wayne’s background included 6 years 
of service for the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter Day Saints, including 
work as a missionary in France. In 
Washington, he served on the staffs of 
Senators Frank Moss, Robert Kennedy, 
and EDWARD KENNEDY. He gave up his 
House seat for an unsuccessful Senate 
race in 1974 and then returned to the 
House in the class of 1986, where I and 
others in that class came to know him 
as an accomplished and supportive colleague. 


He left for another Senate run in 1992 
but in the meantime had found his true 
calling in his work in the Middle East. 

This was hardly a predictable path in 
terms of his personal and professional 
background, but it was one to which he 
was drawn by his experience on the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee, his 
friendship with Daniel Abraham, with 
whom he organized the Center for Middle 
East Peace in 1989, and by his vision 
of what a small, independent and 
creative organization might achieve in 
this political and policy thicket. 

Wayne, Danny Abraham, and the various 
Middle East hands and political 
leaders working with the Center were 
actively involved in the discussions 
leading to the Madrid and Oslo agreements, 
and they found numerous ways 
of encouraging the Israeli-Syrian and 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations of the 
1990s. Wayne was haunted by the 
knowledge of how close to resolution 
those efforts had come only to collapse 
into distrust and violence. He had few 
illusions about the obstacles to getting 
peace negotiations back on track. Still 
he persevered, always looking for the 
openings, the confluences of interest, 
the glimmers of hope that could be 
acted and built upon. He was one of the 
most determined and dedicated persons 
I have ever known. 

Wayne’s approach was mirrored in 
the trip we took in December. We met 
with the heads of state in Syria, Lebanon, 
and Israel, demonstrating again 
the remarkable access and the relationships 
of respect that Wayne and 
the Center had developed across the political 
spectrum in Israel, in the Palestinian 
community, and in most Arab 
states. But many of our visits were 
more narrowly targeted to learn about 
and to encourage promising initiatives 
that are under way. 

For example, we met in Cairo with 
Chief of Intelligence General Omar 
Seuliman regarding the next round of 
cease-fire talks to be brokered by 
Egypt among Hamas, Fatah, and possibly 
other groups. We then visited 
chief Palestinian Authority negotiator 
Abu Mazen on the day it was determined 
that he would personally attend 
this second round. 

We met with Palestinian Authority 
Finance Minister Salam Fayyad regarding 
financial and budget reform, 
where there has been enough progress 
to allow the U.S. to broker the release 
of a first installment of Palestinian 
Authority revenues impounded by 
Israel. 

We talked with Sari Nusseibeh, head 
of Jerusalem Affairs for the PLO, 
about the back-channel, unofficial 
peace initiatives undertaken by him 
and others. 

Wayne specialized in discussions of 
these sorts, which bore witness to his 
remarkable understanding of the politics 
of the region and of the many facets 
of peacemaking, his conviction that 
fact-finding for himself or others required 
diverse sources, and his realization 
that the encouragement offered, 
the feedback given, the information exchanged, 
in such off-the-record sessions 
could be significant. 

As a middle-ranking member of this 
House, I have found such repeated visits, 
and my work with Wayne and the 
center generally, invaluable as a 
source of information and insight and 
as an avenue for engagement. 

Wayne was passionately committed 
to the security and integrity of Israel 
and to justice and self-determination 
for the Palestinians. He understood 
well the relation between those two 
and the unlikelihood of forward movement 
without persistent American engagement. 


The achievement of a comprehensive 
peace among Israel and its neighbors is 
a compelling cause in its own right, 
but it is one given additional urgency 
by the need for regional cooperation 
and support in combating terrorism 
and in disarming Iraq. 

With Wayne Owens’ passing, we have 
lost one of our country’s most determined 
and resourceful contributors to 
this cause. It is critically important 
for those of us who understand the 
value of his work to find ways to carry 
it forward. 

Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from North Carolina 
for his kind comments and now 
yield to the gentlewoman from California 
(Mrs. CAPPS). 

Mrs. CAPPS. Madam Speaker, let me 
first thank the gentleman from Utah 
and all of his colleagues from Utah for 
bringing this resolution to the floor, 
for their wonderful and warm words 
about Wayne Owens; and I wish to extend 
my condolences to his family, his 
wife, Marlene, his five children and 14 
grandchildren. 

Unlike many in this Chamber, I was 
only privileged to know Wayne Owens 
a very short time; but in the weeks 
since he has died, I have learned a 
great deal about this man and his career, 
how he campaigned in 1972 by 
walking his entire district, about his 
courageous vote in the Judiciary Committee 
to impeach President Nixon, 
about his commitment to environmental 
protection which was way 
ahead of its time, and such a tribute to 
the land he represented in Congress. 

I came to know Wayne Owens because 
of his work on another important 
issue, the cause of Middle East peace. 
As a Member of Congress and as a 
founder of the Center for Middle East 
Peace, Wayne Owens never lost sight of 
his dream, that one day Israelis and 
Arabs would put down their weapons 
and take up the mantle of peace. 

Because of Wayne’s decency and fair-
mindedness, he was a rare Middle East 
expert with credibility in the American 
Jewish and the American Arab communities. 
He was respected by Israelis and 
Palestinians alike. 

Wayne Owens was the right messenger 
with the right message, that it 
is in the United States’ interests to 
vigorously pursue peace with Israelis 
and Palestinians; that the cycle of unspeakable 
violence, illustrated so horribly 
just 2 days ago in Tel Aviv, will 
only be broken through a negotiated 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H31 

settlement; that Israelis deserve to live 
in security, and Palestinians in dignity, 
side by side in two sovereign 
states. 

How touching it was that Wayne 
Owens passed away while accompanying 
these two of our colleagues 
who have just spoken on one of his 
countless missions to the region, that 
he passed away on the soil of the land 
he loved so much. 

In my last conversation with Wayne, 
we agreed that I would travel with him 
to the Middle East early this year, and 
although we will not take that trip together, 
I hope to honor, in my own 
way, the memory of this great man and 
his legacy by continuing on this path. 
That path will bring us to the day 
when we can take up and we will wake 
up to the dawn of Middle East peace. 

I thank my colleagues again for remembering 
their cherished colleagues 
in this fitting tribute. He did the State 
of Utah proud. His legacy gives pride to 
our Nation, and his message of negotiated 
settlement for peace gives hope 
to our world. 

Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her kind 
words. It dawned on me during her discussion 
that Congressman Owens has 
been away from this body for 8 years; 
and yet many, many people have taken 
time at an awkward hour, on an important 
day, to express their appreciation 
for him and his work, and I hope that 
this is the kind of thing that his family 
will appreciate and understand and understand 
the depth of the value he 
brought to this institution. 

Madam Speaker, I would yield to the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR). 

Ms. KAPTUR. Madam speaker, I 
want to thank the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. CANNON) very much for his 
leadership in assembling this tribute 
this evening on behalf of our beloved 
colleague Wayne Owens who passed, as 
others have said, in Tel Aviv, as a witness 
for peace, and I would like to encourage 
my friend, the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. CANNON), to consider perhaps 
in Congressman Owens’ memory that 
we, on a bipartisan basis, might create, 
as the gentlewoman from California 
(Mrs. CAPPS) has very wisely suggested, 
a Middle Eastern study group oriented 
toward peace in that region and to do 
so on a bipartisan basis, naming it 
after Congressman Owens who showed 
us the way in that troubled and war-
torn region of the world. 

He was walking the path to peace and 
peace requires heroes and it requires 
heroics; and Wayne Owens, for our Nation, 
is such a hero. My heart goes out 
to his wife, Marlene, his five children, 
two sisters, a brother, 14 grandchildren 
who truly have a hero to admire. 

At age 65 he did not have to go on 
that painstaking journey, 7 days of intensive 
work, trying to find those keyholes 
to peace, and yet he did that. He 
could have been living a comfortable 
life in some condo on some ski slope 
enjoying himself, but his whole life 
showed that Wayne Owens was not 
afraid of hard work. 

In 1989, he cofounded the Center for 
Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation 
here in our Nation’s capital 
and established working relationships 
with leaders from Jordan, Egypt, 
Israel, Palestine, Saudi Arabia and was 
making a difference for all of us as the 
world and our own country is perched 
on the verge of war in that region. He 
was trying to show us a different path. 

He was not afraid of hard work in his 
own life. I mean, from the time he 
washed dishes to work his way through 
school, to walking across his own State 
in the entire second congressional district 
and winning election here, this 
was a man who endured and who rose 
above common effort to heroic level to 
try to help the world, to remove from 
the television every evening those terrible 
images of death in the Middle 
East that infect every child in every 
nation on Earth, certainly our own. 

To his family, may I please extend 
the deepest sympathy of the people of 
our community. I had the great honor 
of being able to work with Wayne in 
our efforts here to find a peaceful road 
in the Middle East. I am forever indebted 
to him, to the organization that 
he founded and to the friendships that 
he made on both sides of the aisle that 
helped us find a better way forward. 

As mission president for the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 
Montreal, Canada, for 3 years, Wayne 
Owens took his own peace quest to a 
much higher level and took it to 
ground zero in the battle for peace in 
the Middle East. 

b1730 
Madam Speaker, I will place in the 
RECORD an article that was in Roll Call 
this week in his honor and also thank 
the gentleman from Utah very much 
for yielding to me this evening. 

FORMER REPRESENTATIVE OWENS DIES 
(By Bree Hocking) 
Wayne Owens, a relentless advocate for 
Arab-Israeli peace and former Democratic 
Representative from Utah, died Dec. 18 while 
walking on a beach in Tel Aviv. 
Owens, who was 65, succumbed to a massive 
heart attack while traveling with a Congressional 
delegation to the region. 
The four-term Congressman served in the 
House from 1973 to 1975 and from 1987 to 1993, 
representing the Salt Lake city area. 
During his Congressional career, he made 
two unsuccessful bids for the Senate. In 1974, 
he lost to Republican Jake Garn and in 1992 
he was defeated by Sen. Bob Bennett (R– 
Utah). He also ran unsuccessfully for governor 
of the Beehive State in 1984. 
A devout Mormon, Owens served as president 
of the Montreal mission for the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the 
mid- to late 1970s. 
Despite his liberal credentials—he was the 
Western states coordinator for the presidential 
bids of both Robert Kennedy and 
now-Sen. Edward Kennedy (D–Mass.), and 
also was a staffer to the later Kennedy— 
Owens was admired by Members from both 
sides of the aisle for his tireless work for 
peace in the Middle East. In 1989, he co-
founded the Center for Middle East Peace 
and Economic cooperation and served as its 
president. 
Owens attended the University of Utah, 
latter earning a law degree from that institution. 


He is survived by his wife, Marlene, five 
children, two sisters, a brother and 14 grandchildren. 


Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, 
thank the gentlewoman from Ohio. If I 
might make a couple of comments on 
things she said. 

I was thinking during this discussion 
that Mr. Owens spent a tenth of his life 
as a Mormon missionary. That is a remarkable 
commitment. Three years as 
a missionary and another 3 years as a 
mission president for the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. 

In addition, the gentlewoman mentioned 
he could have easily spent his 
time on a ski slope. And in fact, in 
Utah, with all due respect to some of 
the other States who pretend, we actually 
have the best skiing in the world. 
So he could easily have taken advantage 
of that. 

In fact, I was talking to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY) a 
few moments ago, who will speak in a 
couple of minutes, in fact I think he is 
next, and he mentioned how healthy 
Wayne was. The fact is he was a 
healthy, robust, happy, thoughtful person 
who could have spent his life skiing 
or doing other things that he would 
have enjoyed and I know he did enjoy. 
But rather than do that, he chose to do 
things that were difficult, that were 
very difficult, and, frankly, very important. 


Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. OBEY). 

Mr. OBEY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding to me. I was 
horrified to learn of Wayne Owens’ 
death last week when I was at C–SPAN, 
just about to go on their morning program, 
and saw the news come across 
the bottom of the screen that Wayne 
had died the day before. 

Wayne and I were neighbors when I 
was first elected to Congress. He and 
his wife lived right next door to my 
wife and I in Arlington in rented 
homes. He was then chief staff assistant 
to Senator KENNEDY. I got to know 
Wayne first as a friend and then I got 
to know him as an even stronger friend 
when he became a colleague of so many 
of us in the House. And after he left 
this House, as has been mentioned, he 
devoted a good deal of his time to the 
cause of peace, especially in the Middle 
East. 

He was a strongly religious man. He 
prided himself on being a Christian and 
he took the responsibilities that come 
with that very seriously. One of those 
responsibilities, in his view, was the 
obligation that all of us have as the 
more comfortable members of the 
human race on this planet to reach out 
to try to help those who are not in such 
comfortable circumstances. He would 
have been appalled to see the lack of a 
sense of shared sacrifice that so often 
permeates what political leaders do 
these days. 

But he never forgot his obligations to 
himself, to his maker, and to his fellow 
man to take into account always the 
needs of others. He was one of the least 


H32 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

selfish human beings I have ever 
known, and he believed passionately 
that in the Middle East, the center of 
so many of the world’s religions, that 
there ought to be a way to bring the 
parties closer to each other to avoid 
the violence and bloodshed that has 
plagued that region of the world for so 
long. 

He is a tremendous loss not just to 
his family, but to all of us who took 
daily inspiration from his lack of cynicism 
and his profound human decency. 

I thank the gentleman very much for 
holding this special order, and I appreciate 
also the comments of my colleagues 
in tribute to this wonderful 
man. 

Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Wisconsin. I 
did not think about it until he spoke, 
but it occurs to me that he did not 
spend a tenth of his life doing missionary 
work, but when we consider 
the religious zeal he brought to the 
Middle East, it was probably more like 
two-tenths or a third of his life in these 
difficult and selfless aspirations. 

Madam Speaker, I now yield to the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. MATHESON). 

Mr. MATHESON. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank my colleague, the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. CANNON). 

I first met Wayne Owens when I was 
12 years old. He was running for Congress 
in 1972 in the State of Utah and 
he took the State by storm. He walked 
over 700 miles during that campaign. 
And the walking was not just a gimmick. 
The walking was an indication of 
the fact that Wayne Owens genuinely, 
genuinely wanted to get to know the 
people of whom he was asking for a 
vote and the people who he was going 
to represent. 

I think throughout his life, with all 
of the great goals that Wayne tried to 
achieve and the big picture and the big 
items he pursued, he never lost that 
notion of relating to the individual person, 
to the common man. That is something 
we here in this House should remember 
as we look back on Wayne’s 
life. 

I had the opportunity to be a campaign 
manager for Wayne Owens during 
one of his elections. It was an exceptional 
opportunity, a challenging opportunity, 
because Wayne, again, always 
liked to dream big and he would 
ask a lot of the people who worked for 
him. He pushed people beyond what 
they thought they could do. And as 
someone who was rather young at the 
time, I got to be a campaign manager, 
and that was something that was a significant 
development in my own life. 
So I considered Wayne a friend, a mentor, 
I considered him my Congressman, 
and I am pleased to occupy the Second 
Congressional District office that 
Wayne once represented so well. 

When Wayne came to Congress the 
first time he happened to be on the 
Committee on the Judiciary, and he 
was involved in the impeachment process 
with then President Nixon. That 
was an exceptional period in Wayne’s 

life. It was a time when he had invested 
so much time and effort in terms of examining 
that issue because he understood 
the gravity of the situation. This 
was not a partisan effort. And I remember 
talking to Wayne about the stories 
of when he actually voted out those articles 
of impeachment, about he and 
his colleagues walking out of the room 
with tears coming down their faces because 
they recognized what a difficult 
circumstance that was for this country. 


I think that was one instance where 
Congress behaved in a professional 
way, and it showed the strength of this 
country that we were able to move on 
from that circumstance, and Wayne 
Owens was an important player in that 
process. 

It was mentioned earlier about how 
he advocated for victims of radiation 
exposure. When Wayne was not in Congress, 
when he was an attorney, he represented 
victims of radiation exposure, 
the widows of the miners that worked 
in the uranium mines, the people who 
were told this was safe when it was not. 
And that work in private life is another 
example of a guy who acted in 
the context of service, and when he got 
to Congress he continued with that and 
pushed ahead with the Radiation Exposure 
Compensation Act. 

This was a critical issue that forced 
the Federal Government to acknowledge 
it had lied to people and exposed 
people to dangerous radiation through 
open air testing of nuclear weapons in 
southern Nevada and also through the 
uranium mining activities; an important 
issue for people throughout the 
Colorado plateau. 

As I have gone through these comments, 
what strikes me is the fact that 
Wayne Owens was a guy who always 
had big goals and big objectives, 
whether it was trying to address a 
wrong that the Federal Government 
had committed and force them to 
admit culpability, whether it was other 
issues we have heard about today, like 
pursuing peace in the Middle East, 
whether it was pursuing a tremendous 
change in public lands policy in Utah, 
with Wayne’s vision of a wilderness 
designation in that State. And there 
were other big goals and lofty dreams 
that Wayne Owens pursued, some of 
which are successful today, and some 
of which the work is going to go on 
past Wayne’s activity in regard to 
those issues. Significant issues. 

I could go on and on. The Central 
Utah Water Project, a project that had 
been involved with Federal funding for 
many, many years but it was going in 
the wrong direction. Wayne was part of 
a group that pulled people together 
from the sportsmen community, from 
the conservation community, from the 
agriculture community, and they completed 
the Central Utah Water Project 
as a Member of Congress in 1991, a significant 
issue that moved the State of 
Utah forward. 

That is the Wayne Owens I am going 
to remember, a guy who would dream 

big and would relentlessly and tirelessly 
pursue issues. But what I will 
also remember is what I pointed out at 
the start of these comments. This was 
someone who was incredibly genuine 
and would listen to people and took the 
public trust very seriously. It is the 
type of approach to the job that I think 
we can all learn from, and I think we 
can do no better activity to honor 
Wayne than to follow in that way in 
terms of how we approach this job. 

Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, 
thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. 
MATHESON) for his kind words and for 
his help in organizing this event for 
Congressman Owens, who preceded him 
sometime ago in his Second District of 
Utah. 

The last time I spent some time with 
Wayne Owens was the evening of one of 
the sniper attacks in northern Virginia 
here and the freeways were shut down. 
Wayne and I flew in together and 
shared a taxicab into town and I had 
the pleasure of spending 2 hours with 
him. 

The nice thing is the government 
only paid the normal fee because we 
split the taxicab fee, but it was one of 
the more pleasant periods of time I 
have spent. We talked about many 
issues and talked about many things. 
We talked about the issues we had 
worked together on and the issues we 
disagreed on. It was a fine experience 
from my perspective. 

The gentleman from Utah (Mr. 
MATHESON) mentioned that Wayne 
Owens was a person who caused you to 
work. I worked for Wayne Owens when 
he was a professor of law and I took a 
class from him. I worked against him 
in some of his campaigns. I was wondering 
about the 12-year-old and 
whether I was actually engaged or not. 
I think, in fact, I am a little older than 
the gentleman from the Second District, 
and will have to do the math 
later to see who had known Mr. OWENS 
longer. He was a dear friend for as long 
as I can remember. 

We did work against each other on 
campaigns. We both suffered through a 
remarkable experience of investigating 
a President, and he and I developed a 
deep bond of shared experience there. 
We both worked together on the 
downwinders issue. That was my first 
job in law school, was working on that 
issue with the father of the gentleman 
from New Mexico (Mr. UDALL), Stewart 
Udall. And it was wonderful that 
Wayne picked that up and made that 
work. 

We both shared a deep, deep love for 
the beautiful public lands of Utah. He 
traveled those lands, I traveled those 
lands, yet we had very distinct differences 
on how those should be managed. 
We shared a kinship, however, 
based upon one of the things that became 
a hallmark of his life, and that 
was, from my perspective, wonderful. 
He was a friend. 

I am richer from my experience in 
knowing Wayne Owens, and we as an 
institution and as a country are poorer 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H33 

for his passing. I would like Marlene 
and the children and grandchildren to 
know how much we cared for him. I 
hope that this hour that we have spent 
talking about him will help them understand 
the deep, deep effect he had 
on our lives and on the course of American 
history, on the course of how we 
deal with our public lands and how we 
deal with individuals. 

Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to the life and work of Wayne Owens 
and to send my regards and sympathy to his 
wife, Marlene and his children and grandchildren. 


I had the privilege of serving with Wayne in 
the House, and I quickly developed a great 
admiration for his hard work, integrity and 
dedication to good public policy. We served 
together on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, 
where he focused his attention on the 
Middle East. 

Wayne was active on a broad range of 
issues, and while he spent much of his career 
focused on weighty matters of international affairs, 
he never lost sight of the issues that 
mattered most to people in his home state of 
Utah. 

Wayne was a very effective legislator, and 
he earned the great respect of Members on 
both sides of the aisle for his willingness to 
put politics aside and tackle the important 
issues of the day. 

After Wayne left Congress I continued to 
have the pleasure of working with him on the 
Middle East peace process. 

As President of the non-profit Center for 
Middle East Peace, Wayne worked tirelessly 
to promote continued dialogue between Arabs 
and Israelis in the Middle East. His goal was 
to help build economic interaction between 
Israel and her Arab and Palestinian neighbors 
and through that work, to support and promote 
the peace process. He spent much of the last 
decade meeting with leaders in the region trying 
to foster peace through economic development. 


He was very effective in this role because 
all sides accepted him as an honest broker. 

Even over the last couple of years, when 
many others gave up hope that Israelis and 
Palestinians would ever be able to resolve 
their differences, Wayne continued his work to 
find common ground. 

He was often frustrated—as we all are from 
time to time—and he understood the realities 
on the ground, but he never stopped believing 
that peace was possible. 

We will sorely miss Wayne, and his dedication 
and creativity. As we work toward a just, 
lasting, and comprehensive peace in the Middle 
East, may we remember Wayne’s life and 
works and let every action we perform be a 
tribute to his memory. 

Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to 
remember the life and work of former Congressman 
Wayne Owens. I did not know 
Wayne when he was a member of this body: 
I met him two years ago when he came to my 
office asking me to support the Middle East 
peace process. 

Wayne’s tireless commitment to Middle East 
peace, his willingness to reach across party 
lines, to go anywhere, and to talk to anyone, 
has been a source of inspiration to all who believe 
that Arabs and Israelis will one day live 
together in peace and security. He was a 
study in moderation and tolerance, a compas


sionate man who believed that all people deserve 
to be treated with respect and dignity. 
Wayne was also a true patriot. He loved his 
country and he believed that our values of 
freedom, prosperity, and tolerance should be 
shared with the entire world, particularly the 
Middle East. 

But what makes this moment most painful 
for me is that Wayne Owens was my friend. 
He was a true champion of peace, and he 
lived and died serving humanity. He will be 
missed dearly.

THE ECONOMY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
BIGGERT). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 7, 2003, the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
take to the floor this evening for the 
first day of the new Congress basically 
to talk about the economy and my concern 
about the fact that the Republican 
majority, President Bush and the 
Republican majority now in both the 
House and the other body, really are 
not doing anything, in my opinion, to 
address the downturn in the economy, 
the loss of jobs, the loss of production. 
It is of a great deal of concern to me 
and I know to my constituents. This is 
their number one concern, what is this 
Congress and what is this President 
going to do to turn the economy 
around. Today is a very important day 
in that regard, because the President 
today, in Chicago, we understand, is 
unveiling his economic stimulus package, 
what he claims will be the answer 
to try to revive the economy. Every indication 
that we have had so far, as 
Democrats, is that his proposal will 
not do anything significant to turn the 
economic situation around, will not 
create more jobs. It is primarily a plan 
that benefits the wealthy, the corporate 
interests, and does very little, 
certainly very little in the next year or 
two, that would make any difference in 
terms of the economic situation in the 
United States and the world. 
Sometimes I think that the White 
House and the Republican leadership in 
both Houses here would like us to 
think that the situation is not that bad 
and so maybe we do not have to do 
much in Congress because the economic 
outlook really is not that bad. 
Let me assure them that that is certainly 
not the case. It certainly is not 
the case with my constituents in New 
Jersey and it certainly is not the case 
with any of my fellow Democrats that 
I talked to today or in the last couple 
of days since we have returned and 
since the swearing in. 
Just to give some idea, and I will not 
talk too long about this, Madam 
Speaker, but since January 2001, when 
President Bush first took office, private 
sector employment has been reduced 
by 2.1 million jobs. The number 
of jobs that have been lost in that period 
now, which is essentially 2 years, 
is over 2 million in the United States. 

b1745 

If we look at other indicators, business 
investment since the first quarter 
of 2001, that is down 10 percent. If I 
look at the budget outlook, that has 
deteriorated by $5 trillion since January 
2001. 

I do not need to show the statistics. 
Members are aware that the stock market 
has declined considerably, unemployment 
is up, the budget surplus that 
existed during the Clinton administration 
which was the first time in almost 
20 years that we had actually turned 
around a budget deficit and we had a 
budget surplus, and that meant that we 
were paying down the debt and more 
jobs were being created and Americans 
had more money and long-term interest 
rates were down because of the surplus. 
In the last 2 years during the 
term of this Republican President, we 
have seen that situation go the other 
way. We now have a budget deficit that 
is something like $150 billion, and we 
anticipate that it will only get worse. 

It is only going to get worse unless 
something is done in this Congress to 
turn it around. The sad thing is when I 
listen to some of the suggestions that 
have been coming out of the White 
House in the last few weeks, including 
today, I am concerned that their proposal 
continues this country down the 
path of larger tax cuts for the wealthy, 
for corporate interests, and larger deficits 
that are only going to make the 
economic situation worse instead of 
better. 

One of the things by way of background 
that really bothers me in terms 
of what comes out of this Republican 
White House is the notion that somehow 
the recession began under the previous 
administration and that the recession 
is not a product of the Bush administration. 
Again, let me give some 
information on that. The National Bureau 
of Economic Research, Business 
Cycle Dating Committee, and this is a 
direct quote, ‘‘In November 2001, the 
committee determined that the peak in 
business activity occurred in the 
United States economy in March 2001.’’ 
A peak marks the end of an expansion 
and the beginning of a recession. The 
determination of a peak date in March 
is, thus, a determination that the expansion 
that began in March 1991 ended 
in March 2001, and a recession began in 
March of that 2001. 

So essentially we had 10 years of increased 
economic activity, of growth, 
and that ended in March of the first 
year that President Bush took office 
after a 10-year expansion that included 
the entire time that President Clinton 
was the President of the United States. 
I do not come here because I want to 
talk about who did this or who did 
that, but the bottom line is for Members 
to suggest that we are not in a bad 
situation economically today, by any 
indicator we clearly are, and clearly 
this recession began under President 
Bush and has only gotten worse in the 
2 years he has been in office. 


H34 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

Now what is the President proposing 
and why is he proposing what he is proposing 
today? Well, he claims that he 
is trying to put together an economic 
stimulus package that essentially will 
turn the economy around, create more 
jobs, get consumer spending up and improve 
the business cycle. 

If we look at what he actually has 
proposed, it is more of the same. It is 
more tax cuts, permanent tax cuts primarily 
for the wealthy. He thinks that 
he is going to turn the stock market 
around by a full exclusion of dividends; 
but, the bottom line is, again, that is 
only going to help wealthy people. 

Media reports on possible elements of 
the administration’s package include 
the following: full exclusion of dividends 
from individual taxation; acceleration 
of marginal tax reductions 
from the 2001 tax cut; acceleration of 
child credit increase from the 2001 tax 
cut; more corporate tax cuts; and possibly 
some State fiscal relief rumored 
at $10 billion. But if we look at what 
the President is proposing today, it 
will primarily mean more of the same, 
more tax cuts and more benefits for the 
wealthy and for corporate interests, 
and it will balloon the Federal deficit. 
It will cost up to $6 billion over 10 
years with more than 80 percent of the 
cost after 2003. 

I think what we are going to see from 
this administration is essentially more 
deficits, larger deficits, more money 
going to the wealthy, and very little, if 
any, short-term stimulus to the economy 
that will turn it around. Members 
do not have to believe me, though. I do 
not like to get in the well and just talk 
about what I think. I like to talk about 
what other third-party commentators 
have been saying about the President’s 
plan; and I wanted to mention this 
evening, and I may read all or parts of 
two comments that were in the New 
York Times today in reaction to what 
has already come out about the President’s 
tax proposals and the President’s 
so-called economic stimulus 
package. 

The editorial in today’s New York 
Times is particularly revealing, and I 
will read parts to give Members an idea 
why I think what they are saying is so 
true. The title is ‘‘The Charles Schwab 
Tax Cut.’’ It begins: ‘‘The Bush administration 
never met a domestic problem 
that tax cuts couldn’t cure, and 
today in Chicago the President is planning 
to call for more of the same. The 
centerpiece of Mr. Bush’s new economic 
plan is to eliminate the tax on 
dividends that will cost the Treasury 
about $30 billion over the next decade. 
In a theoretical world, ending the dividend 
tax might make sense. Unfortunately, 
we live in the real one, where 
it’s the wrong move at the wrong time 
for the benefit of the wrong people. 

‘‘Ending the dividend tax cut will not 
provide the economy with a short-term 
stimulus, the ostensible goal of the 
plan. Investors won’t be seeing their 
savings until 2004.’’ 

Eliminating the dividend tax, admittedly, 
has something to commend it, 

but as became all too apparent in the 
financial bubble of the late 1990s, the 
Tax Code currently contains some perverse 
incentives for companies to becoming 
overly indebted and to manipulate 
their short-term stock price, instead 
of paying dividends as a form of 
prudent profit sharing. 

The editorial continues: ‘‘If Mr. 
Bush’s mind had been on the long-term 
economy rather than on politics, he 
might have listened to the advice of his 
former Treasury Secretary, Paul 
O’Neill, and dropped the idea of further 
tax cuts altogether. But Mr. O’Neill is 
a former Treasury Secretary for a reason. 
The President cannot afford to 
look indifferent to the problems of average 
Americans in a sluggish economy. 
These days average Americans 
own stock, although most of it is in 
tax-sheltered retirement funds.’’ 

This is what they say in conclusion, 
and I think it is important: ‘‘Ending 
the dividend tax is something almost 
nobody has been crying out for, except 
the megabroker Charles Schwab, who 
made a pitch for it at the economic 
summit meeting at Waco last summer. 
The President happened to drop in on 
the panel on which Mr. Schwab was 
speaking and pronounced it a good 
idea. It may turn out to have been one 
of the most expensive courtesy calls in 
modern history.’’ 

What the New York Times is essentially 
saying and what the Democrats 
are saying is that this elimination of 
the tax on dividends is going to cost 
the Federal Government a tremendous 
amount of money, $300 billion over the 
next 10 years, but it is not going to do 
anything to actually put money back 
into the pockets of consumers. It is not 
going to create any new jobs. It is not 
going to provide any real incentive for 
companies to start new production and 
create more jobs, do any investment in 
new production; and all it does is give 
another huge tax break primarily to 
very wealthy individuals who own most 
of the stock. How is this a stimulus? 
How is this in any way going to help 
the economy? 

I wanted to talk about what the 
Democrats have in mind, and then I 
want to give some third-party validation 
of what we have proposed. Over 
the last month, the House Democrats 
have gotten together and basically 
thought about what needed to be done 
to try to give some short-term stimulus 
to the economy, to create jobs, to 
put more money in people’s pockets, to 
turn things around. 

We came up with a set of principles 
initially, and then yesterday we revealed 
our actual plan. I think the 
principles are important and need to be 
repeated before I mention some of the 
specifics of the plan. 

The principles say any economic 
stimulus plan should, first, be front 
loaded and fast acting; second, avoid a 
mushrooming deficit in the long term; 
third, boost consumer demand and investment; 
fourth, help States through 
their fiscal straits; five, spur the econ


omy by funding homeland defense; and, 
last, devote every penny to short-term 
stimulus. 

We are not interested in looking 
right now at how something is going to 
impact 10 years from now. We need to 
get people back to work. We need to 
put money in consumers’ pockets, and 
we need to make sure whatever we do 
does not have any ballooning effect and 
create more of a deficit down the road 
in 2 or 3 years. 

What the Democrats have proposed 
in that regard is very detailed, but I 
wanted to just go over some of the 
more important points, if I could. With 
regard to individuals in terms of individual 
tax cuts, basically we are proposing 
essentially a rebate that Americans 
get back 10 percent of what they 
earned in 2001 up to $6,000 of wages for 
a couple. This rebate is paid from the 
Treasury, not from the Social Security 
trust fund, because one of the other 
concerns that I have and all of us have 
as Democrats is not only do we do not 
want to increase the deficit, but we 
also do not want to delve into the Social 
Security and Medicare trust funds 
and aggravate the deficits that potentially 
could exist long term in those 
trust funds. We want to make sure that 
those trust funds have a surplus and 
that the money is available for Social 
Security and Medicare for senior citizens 
in the future. So our rebate plan 
does not tap any of the Social Security 
or Medicare trust funds. 

Let me give a little more detail 
about what the Democrats have in 
mind. The Democratic plan is $130 billion 
as opposed to the Republican plan, 
which is $600 billion. Now the $130 billion 
is a smaller plan because, again, 
we do not want to increase the deficit. 
We are trying to do everything in 2003 
to stimulate the economy and not 
cause long-term deficits. But even with 
the $130 billion stimulus, we can create 
as many as a million jobs, increase 
consumer spending, and help States 
out of their fiscal straits because if the 
States have to significantly cut back 
on their budgets, that is going to be 
taking more money out of the economy 
and could also aggravate the problem 
in terms of Americans losing their jobs 
and not having money to spend. We 
have to address the States as well. 

The Democratic plan calls for a 26week 
extension of unemployment benefits 
and a tax rebate of up to $300 per 
person, $600 per couple. It would also 
permit businesses to increase their 
write-off on new investments and provide 
$31 billion to State and local governments 
to help defray the cost of domestic 
security, Medicaid, highway 
projects and other programs. 

Just a little more detail because I do 
not want to get into all of the details 
tonight, but in addition to extending 
the unemployment benefits and offering 
a tax rebate, the plan would allow 
small businesses to write off up to 
$50,000 of the cost of new investments 
made in 2003 as opposed to the current 
maximum write-off of $250,000. The 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H35 

plan would also permit companies to 
depreciate 50 percent of the cost of new 
plants or equipment in 2003; current 
law permits them to depreciate only 30 
percent. 

So we have a program that helps individuals 
by extending unemployment 
insurance for at least 26 weeks. We 
have a program that puts money back 
in consumers’ pockets with the rebates 
that I mentioned, and we have a plan 
that helps small businesses, which is 
the backbone of our economy, to grow 
and invest in new production and create 
more jobs. 

Lastly, we have an answer that we 
think can make a difference for the 
States: as I said, $31 billion in State 
aid. The plan would give $31 billion to 
States which as I said are struggling 
with these budget shortfalls, a onetime 
increase in the Federal share of 
Medicaid payments amounting to $10 
billion. It would also give them $10 billion 
in grants to help them pay for domestic 
security needs like airport protection 
and public health preparedness, 
as well as $5 billion in Federal aid for 
highways and $6 billion for critical 
State needs to help those most hurt by 

unemployment and the lackluster 
economy. 
b1800 

So, as I said, Madam Speaker, the 
idea is to help individuals, help small 
businesses, and help the States. But all 
of it is designed specifically for the 
year 2003 to turn the economy around, 
to provide a stimulus, to create jobs. It 
is really a job creation program. If you 
look at what the Democrats have proposed, 
it is a job creation program. If 
you look at what the Republicans have 
proposed, it is a stock market-oriented 
program. And we know about the volatility 
of the stock market. I would venture 
to say that it is highly speculative. 
Even the White House will say 
that their dividend plan will not necessarily 
result in a significant increase 
in the stock market’s performance. Yet 
they continue to make the highlight of 
their economic stimulus plan related 
to eliminating the tax on dividends. 

Again, I always say that rather than 
just listen to me, I would like to have 
some third-party validator of what I 
have mentioned this evening in the 
brief time that I have talked about the 
need for an economic stimulus. I saw 
an article, an op-ed that was in today’s 
New York Times, also, by Paul 
Krugman. He basically criticizes the 
President’s proposal and he talks about 
the Democratic alternative in a very 
succinct way. I would just like to read 
some sections of that now and include 
the op-ed in its entirety in the RECORD, 
if I could, Madam Speaker. 

It says: 

Here’s how it works. Faced with a real 
problem—terrorism, the economy, nukes in 
North Korea—the Bush administration’s response 
has nothing to do with solving that 
problem. Instead it exploits the issue to advance 
its political agenda. 

Right now a sensible plan would rush help 
to the long-term unemployed, whose bene


fits—in an act of incredible callousness— 
were allowed to lapse last month. It would 
provide immediate, large-scale aid to beleaguered 
State governments, which have been 
burdened with expensive homeland security 
mandates even as their revenues have 
plunged. Given our long-run budget problems, 
any tax relief would be temporary, and 
go largely to low- and middle-income families. 


That is what the Democrats want to 
do. What does Paul Krugman say? 

Yesterday House Democrats released a 
plan right out of the textbook: aid to States 
and the jobless, rebates to everyone. But the 
centerpiece of the administration’s proposal 
is, of all things, the permanent elimination 
of taxes on dividends. 

So instead of a temporary measure, we get 
a permanent tax cut. The price tag of the 
overall plan is a whopping $600 billion, yet 
less than $100 billion will arrive in the first 
year. The Democratic plan, with an overall 
price tag of only $136 billion, actually provides 
more short-run stimulus. 

And instead of helping the needy, the Bush 
plan is almost ludicrously tilted toward the 
very, very well off. If you have stocks in a 
401(k), your dividends are already tax-sheltered; 
this proposal gives big breaks only to 
people who have lots of stock outside their 
retirement accounts. More than half the benefits 
would go to people making more than 
$200,000 per year, a quarter to people making 
more than $1 million per year. 

Even the administration’s economists 
barely pretend that this proposal has anything 
to do with short-run stimulus. Instead 
they sell it as the answer to various other 
problems. 

I do not want to keep reading, but 
the point I am trying to make is very 
simple. What the President appears to 
have done, and I do not necessarily 
want to give him bad intentions, is 
rather than doing a real economic 
stimulus that is going to have a short-
term impact on the economy, turn the 
economy around and create jobs and 
put money back in people’s pockets, he 
is trying to simply make more tax cuts 
primarily for the wealthy, for the corporate 
interests that are the primary 
backers of the Republican Party. And 
he does not even care about the fact 
that on a long-term basis this is only 
going to increase the deficit. I just cannot 
believe that this is the President’s 
and the Republicans’ answer to this 
economic downturn. 

I think that as Democrats, we have 
to do whatever we can over the next 
few weeks to bare this proposal for 
what it really is and to make it absolutely 
clear that this is not going to do 
anything to turn the economy around. 

Madam Speaker, I include the following 
for the RECORD: 

[From the New York Times, Jan. 7, 2003] 

AN IRRELEVANT PROPOSAL 

(By Paul Krugman) 

Here’s how it works. Faced with a real 
problem—terrorism, the economy, nukes in 
North Korea—the Bush administration’s response 
has nothing to do with solving that 
problem. Instead it exploits the issue to advance 
its political agenda. 

Nonetheless, the faithful laud our glorious 
leader’s wisdom. For a variety of reasons, including 
the desire to avoid charges of liberal 
bias, most reporting is carefully hedged. And 
the public, reading only praise or he-said


she-said discussions, never grasps the fundamental 
disconnect between problem and policy. 


And so it goes with the administration’s 
‘‘stimulus’’ plan. 

Boosting a stumbling economy (‘‘It’s Clinton’s 
fault!’’ shouted the claque) isn’t rocket 
science. All a sensible plan must do is focus 
on the present, not the distant future; on 
those who are suffering, not on those doing 
well; and on those who are most likely to 
spend additional money. 

Right now a sensible plan would rush help 
to the long-term unemployed, whose benefits—
in an act of incredible callousness— 
were allowed to lapse last month. It would 
provide immediate, large-scale aid to beleaguered 
state governments, which have been 
burdened with expensive homeland security 
mandates even as their revenues have 
plunged. Given our long-run budget problems, 
any tax relief would be temporary, and 
go largely to low- and middle-income families. 


Yesterday House Democrats released a 
plan right out of the textbook: aid to states 
and the jobless, rebates to everyone. But the 
centerpiece of the administration’s proposal 
is, of all things, the permanent elimination 
of taxes on dividends. 

So instead of a temporary measure, we get 
a permanent tax cut. The price tag of the 
overall plan is a whopping $600 billion, yet 
less than $100 billion will arrive in the first 
year. The Democratic plan, with an overall 
price tag of only $136 billion, actually provides 
more short-run stimulus. 

And instead of helping the needy, the Bush 
plan is almost ludicrously tilted toward the 
very, very well off. If you have stocks in a 
401(k), your dividends are already tax-sheltered; 
this proposal gives big breaks only to 
people who have lots of stock outside their 
retirement accounts. More than half the benefits 
would go to people making more than 
$200,000 per year, a quarter to people making 
more than $1 million per year. (‘‘Class warfare!’’ 
shouted the claque.) 

Even the administration’s economists 
barely pretend that this proposal has anything 
to do with short-run stimulus. Instead 
they sell it as the answer to various other 
problems. (It slices! It dices! It pure´es!) 
Above all, it’s supposed to end the evil of 
‘‘double taxation.’’ 

Now lots of income faces double taxation, 
in the sense that the same dollar gets taxed 
more than once along the way. For example, 
most of us pay income and payroll taxes 
when we earn our salary, then pay sales 
taxes when we spend it. So why has it suddenly 
become urgent to ensure that dividends, 
in particular, never be taxed more 
than once! 

That is, if they’re taxed at all. In practice, 
the Bush plan would exempt a lot of in-
come—rich people’s income—from all taxes. 
Thanks to the efforts of lobbyists, today’s 
corporate tax code has as many holes in it as 
a piece of Swiss cheese, and today’s corporations 
take full advantage. Case in point: Between 
1998 and 2001 CSX Corporation, the 
company run by the incoming Treasury secretary, 
John Snow, made $900 million in 
profits, but paid no net taxes—in fact, it received 
$164 million in rebates. This wasn’t 
exceptional; the average tax rate on profits 
has fallen to a nearly 60-year low. 

Anyway, even to debate the pros and cons 
of dividend taxation is to play the administration’s 
game, which is to change the subject. 
Weren’t we supposed to be talking 
about emergency economic stimulus? 

No doubt the final version of the ‘‘stimulus’’ 
plan will contain a few genuine recession-
fighting measures—a child credit here, 
an unemployment benefit there, a few 
crumbs for the states—for which the administration 
will expect immense gratitude. But 


H36 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

the man in charge—that is, Karl Rove—is 
clearly betting that the economy will recover 
on its own, and intends to use the pretense 
of stimulus mainly as an opportunity 
to get more tax cuts for the rich. 

Ideology aside, will these guys ever decide 
that their job includes solving problems, not 
just using them? 

I yield to my friend from Oregon. 

Mr. DEFAZIO. I appreciate the gentleman 
coming to the floor to try and 
explain the differences between these 
two critical plans. I happen to represent 
a part of the State of Oregon 
which has the highest unemployment 
rate in the United States of America 
and a part of the State which is particularly 
hard hit and am very concerned 
about an effective economic 
stimulus package. Representing a district 
with a high and enduring unemployment 
rate, I do not find that the 
elimination of the tax on dividends is 
very high on the agenda of anybody 
that I meet with in my district and 
how we are going to put people back to 
work and how we are going to get the 
economy rolling again. 

I share the gentleman’s concerns. 
Certainly there are some interesting 
arguments to be made about how best 
to properly tax corporate profits and/or 
dividends which result from them, but 
if one looks underneath that whole 
issue, we find that many profitable corporations 
do not pay taxes and, therefore, 
the dividends are not being double-
taxed in any way or form whatsoever. 
And also many of the individuals 
who realize these dividends are not the 
people who are unemployed or are worrying 
about their future or how to put 
food on the table for their kids. In fact, 
as the gentleman said earlier in the 
discussion, more than two-thirds of the 
benefits will accrue to people with incomes 
over $100,000 a year. The question 
becomes, is that an effective economic 
stimulus? 

Let us see. A year from now, people 
will begin to file their taxes, probably 
most of the folks who clip coupons and 
dividends would be a little later in the 
year, so maybe 15 months from now 
some of those people who earn over 
$100,000 a year would realize an additional 
savings in their taxes or maybe 
a refund which would come in April or 
May or June and somehow that is 
going to provide an economic stimulus 
in the year 2003 when that does not 
happen until the year 2004? Beyond 
that, there is a whole issue of is this 
not a revisiting of trickle-down economics? 
If we give a little bit more to 
the people who are already doing relatively 
well, or in some cases very 
well, will they not spend that money in 
a way to put people back to work? I 
think there are some real questions 
about that, but it is at least more artfully 
presented than it was years ago 
under the Reagan administration. They 
are avoiding the words ‘‘trickle down.’’ 

But as the gentleman discussed, 
there are alternatives out there. We 
could certainly look at, as an alternative, 
things that are going to have a 
more immediate impact on the econ


omy of the United States and put more 
middle- and low-income families back 
to work or on a more secure economic 
footing. If we look at, from my perspective 
on the Transportation Committee, 
the Nation’s incredible underfunding of 
infrastructure, in my State alone, 
again the State with the highest unemployment 
in the union, has discovered 
that because of construction techniques 
used for the interstates back in 
the sixties, we have a $4 billion bridge 
problem on I–5, the most vital interstate-
international link on the western 
corridor between Mexico, California, 
Oregon, Washington and Canada. That 
is something, in a State in as deep a recession 
as we are, that is beyond our 
capabilities. We need some additional 
help from the Federal Government. We 
know what the problems are. We could 
get people to work within months, as 
soon as the contracts could be let on 
making those repairs. Critical water. 
There are a whole host of infrastructure 
needs, rail, bridges, highways, 
water, that would put people back to 
work and would provide secondary benefits 
to suppliers and small businesses 
in the communities where the workers 
would be. All these things would certainly 
have a much more direct economic 
impact than a tax break to people 
who are concerned about the taxation 
on their dividends that would accrue 
to them some 16 or 18 months 
from now. Hopefully by then this issue 
will be behind us. 

The President’s plan, of course, is so 
extraordinarily expensive. I mean, 
more than half of the President’s entire 
plan is devoted to the concern 
about people who pay taxes on dividends 
as opposed to his rather small 
benefits for people on unemployment. 
We need a much more robust extension 
there. We need more worker retraining. 
There are other issues that could be debated. 
Whether or not we should have 
some sort of tax holiday on part of the 
FICA tax. More than half the families 
in America pay more in Social Security 
and Medicare taxes than they do 
in income taxes to the Federal Government. 
So if we could provide some relief 
there but not short the Social Security 
fund by putting that money 
back in; the States, as the Democrats 
have proposed, to provide to the 
States. 

We have heard for years from that 
side of the aisle, Federal mandates, no 
unfunded Federal mandates. A whole 
host of new ones have come down, including 
the Leave No Child Behind Act 
and the testing that is required, yet 
there is no additional money flowing 
from the Federal Government; yet the 
States and particularly my State is 
strapped and the President’s tax proposal 
would actually take money from 
the States, $4 billion for the exemption 
of dividends, so States again would not 
be able to get taxes from those most 
well off and would be forced to either 
cut benefits for everybody else on programs, 
or essential schools, on health 
care, or they would have to raise taxes 

again on the remaining smaller tax 
base. 

I applaud the gentleman for taking 
the time to come and try and outline 
some of these differences here on the 
floor. It is critical that people know 
they have a very clear choice. I think 
over the last couple of years, that was 
not so clear to many people, but now it 
is our duty to show them that there are 
clear choices to be made on some of 
these very, very critical issues, and 
this is the first one out of the chute 
after the elections of last year. I am 
determined that we will draw the lines 
and we will show here is what we would 
do, it is more responsible, it would provide 
more direct stimulus, it would 
benefit more people and more people in 
need in particular as opposed to what 
is being proposed by the other side of 
the aisle which is fiscally irresponsible, 
not paid for, will not kick in for 16 to 
18 months or even longer and is really 
just trying to do what they were already 
doing before we were in a recession 
or proposing before we were in a 
recession but justify it by saying it 
will help us with a recession. 

I thank the gentleman for clarifying 
those issues. 

Mr. PALLONE. I just want to thank 
my colleague from Oregon for coming 
down and saying what he said. The 
thing that is amazing to me, I tried to 
point out in the beginning that essentially 
this recession began in March of 
2001, I guess 3 months into President 
Bush’s term. Not too long after that he 
imposed or got the Congress, primarily 
Republicans, to pass this huge tax cut 
which primarily went to the wealthy 
individuals and corporate interests. 
That has now been around, I guess, for 
a little over a year approximately and 
the recession has only gotten worse. So 
why now are we talking about another 
major tax cut that essentially does the 
same thing, making permanent those 
tax cuts from a year ago and then coming 
up with this exclusion of tax on 
dividends which admittedly is being 
done in order to try to boost up the 
stock market and therefore again primarily 
benefits wealthy people. It is 
sort of like a failed policy has not 
worked, so why are you going to make 
it worse? But even beyond that, the 
idea, as you say, of having the majority 
of this stimulus package be directly 
linked to trying to boost the stock 
market is such a risky thing. We all 
know the stock market’s volatility. It 
is not necessarily dependent on any 
one factor. So to suggest that dealing 
with dividends is somehow going to increase 
the indexes dramatically I just 
do not buy, and I think it is so speculative 
and it is so much easier to do the 
kinds of things that the Democrats 
have proposed. I just want to thank 
you again for joining us. 

I yield to the gentlewoman from 
Ohio. 

Ms. KAPTUR. I want to thank my 
very able colleague the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H37 

DEFAZIO) for participating and spearheading 
this special order this evening. 
I think when the gentleman from New 
Jersey reminded us that the current recession 
was triggered back in March of 
2001, we have to ask ourselves, well, 
what happened there? What happened 
was again rising oil prices in the global 
market, which America does not control 
because we are totally dependent 
on imports, thrust us into a recession 
which has only gotten worse and all 
the pump priming on Wall Street cannot 
draw us out of it because we are 
not energy independent. Oil just went 
up to $33 a barrel. There is instability 
obviously in the Middle East, certainly 
in Venezuela, Colombia, all these 
places where we are getting our oil, 
and the kind of short-term stimulus 
package that you are talking about 
would be an immediate shot in the arm 
here in the United States of America, 
whether it is building bridges, whether 
it is putting a small tax refund in the 
pockets of Americans that they can go 
out and buy things, ordinary Americans 
who are having trouble meeting 
ends from paycheck to paycheck. But 
beyond that, looking at how we can 
create entire new industries in this 
country so that we do not have to send 
our men and women to war for oil but, 
rather, that we can invest here at 
home. 

Can you imagine the sentinel call it 
would be across just rural America if 
we really racheted up biofuels production 
and ethanol and biodiesel from 
coast to coast, what we could do to replace 
25 percent of what we are importing 
today? I really wanted to say to 
both of my dear colleagues that there 
was an editorial in the New York 
Times on January 5 by Tom Friedman 
called ‘‘A War for Oil.’’ I would like to 
place it in the RECORD this evening as 
a part of this discussion and to say 
with all the pomp and circumstance 
that occurred here in the House today, 
the reality is we are faced with a likelihood 
that we will be at war with Iraq 
very soon. To do so at a time when we 
are suffering this major recession here 
at home, where we have got these rising 
oil prices globally and we are not 
energy independent, we are going into 
huge debt in terms of the government 
with all these tax payouts left and 
right to some of the wealthiest people 
in our country and no help for job creation 
here in this country, even in the 
key industry where we are totally vulnerable, 
that is, new fuels production. 

b1815 
We are importing over 60 percent of 
what we consume today and paying exorbitant 
prices for it, and Mr. Friedman 
says in his article that any war we 
launch in Iraq will certainly be in part 
about oil and that the Bush team is 
preparing to launch that war for oil 
and to deny the fact is actually laughable. 
And he says that the Bush policy 
towards North Korea has made it abundantly 
clear that the war with Iraq indeed 
is about oil. 

The question is whether it is only 
about oil. And I am sure that the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO), 
who has been a leader in new-fuels production 
and energy independence for 
America, in his own region when we 
consider the biomass that is out there 
that could be turned to new-fuels production 
we can see the jobs and the investment 
here in the United States 
that could happen if we would really 
propel this new industry forward. 

What good does it do to give shareholders 
in multinational oil companies 
on Wall Street more dividends when 
those dollars do not have to be invested 
in this country at all? So much of what 
Wall Street has been doing is not investing 
in the United States. They 
have been moving jobs to Mexico. The 
other day I just bought some windshield 
wipers for my car, turned the 
package over, made in Mexico. In fact 
I have a question. Is anything made in 
America anymore? If we look at this 
past holiday shopping season, what is 
actually out there that we make? I am 
glad we can still make bridges if we 
would only fund them in our country, 
but try to find an American-made 
clock, American-made clothing. I just 
talked to a gentleman today downstairs. 
He said, Boy, I wish I could find 
a good pair of shoes. He said, My feet 
are killing me. And I said, Well, they 
are not made in America anymore. 

What is it that we do make that is 
not being outsourced somewhere else? 
So the recession is being exacerbated 
by the fact that so much of what Wall 
Street has done with the money is not 
to put it here but to put it elsewhere 
where they can pay slave wages to people 
and then ship all those goods back 
here. So all this investment, I would be 
very interested in entertaining a proposal 
from the Bush administration to 
require that any benefits to Wall 
Street be invested in the USA and to 
do it in a stimulus plan in some of the 
key sectors where we are strategically 
vulnerable, including energy, where we 
are totally dependent on these international 
imports now more and more 
every day. 

And when we think about the fact 
that Iraq has the second largest reserves 
in the world, one of my questions 
of the Bush administration is, if 
they are going to go in and take over 
these reserves, who is going to benefit? 
Which companies are going to get the 
benefit of that? Maybe we should do 
some windfall profits taxes on the companies 
that are going to be getting all 
these Iraqi oil concessions and then use 
those dollars to buy down our public 
debt and pay off some of the bills that 
are being added every day with the tax 
cuts to the wealthiest people in this 
country. 

So I just am very interested in what 
Tom Friedman said here, and he even 
talks about handing out drilling concessions 
to U.S. oil companies and how 
are those decisions going to be made by 
the administration. How is the administration 
going to get through this 

issue of nation-building in Iraq? Is this 
going to be like Somalia? I thought we 
were not supposed to be involved in nation-
building. We are not out of Afghanistan 
yet. We are paying more and 
more and more every day. Our troops 
are on the ground there. Of course 
there is a press blackout; so you really 
do not know everything that is happening. 
We are not going to be out of 
there for years. The President of Afghanistan 
was on the board of Unical 
Oil Company, and when one looks at 
the movement of oil globally, it is obvious 
that control of that country and 
the movement of pipelines is really 
very essential to the global movement 
of oil, which is a diminishing world resource. 


So the real question I have is, if we 
are going to have a stimulus package, 
how do we get investment here at home 
and how do we displace particularly in 
the energy area the kind of imports 
that have now moved us to the brink of 
war again in the most oil-rich region of 
the world? I am deeply concerned about 
the direction of this country and 
whether or not we have an exit strategy 
from Iraq. And when we look at the 
amount of money we are going to be 
spending on defense in order to move 
these troops and planes and ships for 
long periods of time now, the Ohio National 
Guard just had the longest deployment 
in Ohio history in that part 
of the world, and they have just returned 
home, building airfields, preparing. 


This is costing an enormous amount. 
Imagine if we could invest those dollars 
here at home and create entire 
new industries, not just off biofuels, 
ethanol and biodiesel in the rural countryside, 
but what about photovoltaics 
to really rachet up our knowledge in 
that key area and manufacture those 
systems here in the United States not 
just for use here at home but for use 
abroad, to really move us into renewable 
resources of energy for the future. 
What an incredible job creator that 
would be, good jobs, high-paying jobs 
coast to coast in order to buy America 
true national security and energy independence 
here at home. 

So I want to thank the gentleman for 
allowing me to share in this Special 
Order this evening and to say that I 
agree with Tom Friedman. I am not 
somebody who wants to go to war for 
oil. I think we should invest those dollars 
here at home and help America 
move beyond the petroleum age into a 
new age of renewables. I thank both 
gentlemen. 

I include the following editorial for 
the RECORD: 

[From the New York Times, Jan. 5, 2003] 

A WAR FOR OIL? 

(By Thomas L. Friedman) 

Our family spent winter vacation in Colorado, 
and one day I saw the most unusual 
site: two women marching around the Aspen 
Mountain ski lift, waving signs protesting 
against war in Iraq. One sign said: ‘‘Just war 
or Just Oil?’’ As I watched this two-woman 
demonstration, I couldn’t help notice the 


H38 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

auto traffic whizzing by them: one gas-guzzling 
S.U.V. or Jeep after another, with even 
a Humvee or two tossed in for good measure. 
The whole scene made me wonder whether 
those two women weren’t—indeed—asking 
the right question: Is the war that the Bush 
team is preparing to launch in Iraq really a 
war for oil? 

My short answer is yes. Any war we launch 
in Iraq will certainly be—in part—about oil. 
To deny that is laughable. But whether it is 
seen to be only about oil will depend on how 
we behave before an invasion and what we 
try to build once we’re there. 

I say this possible Iraq war is partly about 
oil because it is impossible to explain the 
Bush team’s behavior otherwise. Why are 
they going after Saddam Hussein with the 
82nd Airborne and North Korea with diplomatic 
kid gloves—when North Korea already 
has nuclear weapons, the missiles to deliver 
them, a record of selling dangerous weapons 
to anyone with cash, 100,000 U.S. troops in its 
missile range and a leader who is even more 
cruel to his own people than Saddam? 

One reason, of course, is that it is easier to 
go after Saddam. But the other reason is 
oil—even if the president doesn’t want to 
admit it. (Mr. Bush’s recent attempt to hype 
the Iraqi threat by saying that an Iraqi attack 
on America—which is most unlikely— 
‘‘would cripple our economy’’ was embarrassing. 
It made the president as if he was 
groping for an excuse to go to war, absent a 
smoking gun. 

Let’s cut the nonsense. The primary reason 
the Bush team is more focused on Saddam is 
because if he were to acquire weapons of 
mass destruction, it might give him the leverage 
he has long sought—not to attack us, 
but to extend his influence over the world’s 
largest source of oil, the Persian Gulf. 

But wait a minute. There is nothing illegitimate 
or immoral about the U.S. being 
concerned that an evil, megalomaniacal dictator 
might acquire excessive influence over 
the natural resource that powers the world’s 
industrial base. 

‘‘Would those women protesting in Aspen 
prefer that Saddam Hussien control the oil 
instead—is that morally better?’’ asks Michael 
Mandelbaum, the John Hopkins foreign 
policy expert and author of ‘‘The Ideas That 
Conquered the World.’’ ‘‘Up to now, Saddam 
has used this oil wealth not to benefit his 
people, but to wage war against all his neighbors, 
build lavish palaces and acquire weapons 
of mass destruction.’’ 

This is a good point, but the Bush team 
would have a stronger case for fighting a war 
partly for oil if it made clear by its behavior 
that it was acting for the benefit of the planet, 
not simply to fuel American excesses. 

I have no problem with a war for oil—if we 
accompany it with a real program for energy 
conservation. But when we tell the world 
that we couldn’t care less about climate 
change, that we feel entitled to drive whatever 
big cars we feel like, that we feel entitled 
to consume however much oil we like, 
the message we send is that a war for oil in 
the gulf is not a war to protect the world’s 
right to economic survival—but our right to 
indulge. Now that will be seen as immoral. 

And should we end up occupying Iraq, and 
the first thing we do is hand out drilling concessions 
to U.S. oil companies alone, that 
perception would only be intensified. 

And that leads to my second point. If we 
occupy Iraq and simply install a more pro-

U.S. autocrat to run the Iraqi gas station (as 
we have in other Arab oil states), then this 
war partly for oil would also be immoral 
If, on the other hand, the Bush team, and 
the American people, prove willing to stay in 
Iraq and pay the full price, in money and 
manpower, needed to help Iraqis build a 
more progressive, democratizing Arab 

state—one that would use its oil income for 
the benefit of all its people and serve as a 
model for its neighbors—then a war partly 
over oil would be quite legitimate. It would 
be a critical step toward building a better 
Middle East. 

So, I have no problem with a war for oil— 
provided that it is to fuel the first progressive 
Arab regime, and not just our S.U.V.’s, 
and provided we behave in a way that makes 
clear to the world we are protecting everyone’s 
access to oil at reasonable prices—not 
simply our right to binge on it. 

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Ms. KAPTUR) for her remarks. Two 
things or maybe three things that I 
really appreciate. One, I think it is 
very important to bring up the crises 
or I should say the increase costs of oil 
and how that has steadily gone up in 
the last 2 years or so and is a major 
factor also impacting the economy and 
that this administration has not done 
anything in the first 2 years to make 
us more energy independent. They have 
fiddled around and talked about a lot 
of things, but nothing has actually 
been accomplished. 

The other thing is, in listening to the 
gentlewoman, it is almost as if President 
Bush is just going back to the old 
sort of trickle-down economics; in 
other words, we give all the money to 
the rich. Now we give this huge tax 
break with dividends primarily to the 
wealthy and somehow that is going to 
trickle down. But as the gentlewoman 
pointed out, that is not what happens 
because the money is just invested 
overseas, and one of the things that I 
mentioned before and that is an important 
part of the Democrat stimulus 
package is relief for small businesses, 
which is specifically targeted so that it 
has to be used to reinvest in new jobs, 
new means of production, and the majority 
of the jobs that are created in 
the United States these days are 
through small business. 

So we are doing the opposite. They 
are saying we will give a big boost to 
the big corporate interests and the 
wealthy and they are somehow going 
to spend it to create jobs; but there are 
no strings attached, whereas the Democrats 
have a proposal that specifically 
targets small businesses and insists 
that whatever tax savings or credits 
are specifically for new jobs and new 
production here, which I think is crucial 
because otherwise it is a waste, 
and the gentlewoman has pointed that 
out very effectively. 

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I wanted 
to say to the gentleman, if one looks at 
the last 25 years, it is very important 
to point out that our last four recessions 
were all related to rising oil 
prices going back to the 1970’s, the 
1980’s, and now the new 21st century. 
And if we do not learn from history, we 
are doomed to repeat it; and what has 
happened over a period of time is that 
there has been more and more military 
presence placed around the world in 
order to guard the oil lanes coming in 
here, and it truly would be destabilizing 
to our country if those paths 

were eliminated, but the answer for 
America is not to become more and 
more dependent on foreign supplies but 
rather to use not just the short-term 
stimulus package but the long-term 
economic growth strategy for our 
country to create energy independence 
so that we are not so vulnerable, and 
every time some oil baron or king 
wants to make it a little tough on 
America, they raise prices and then we 
are thrown into recession. They know 
they do not want us to go into deep, 
deep depression because then they lose 
some of their revenue, but the point is 
we are like a puppet on the end of a 
string and we are not controlling our 
own destiny. So I would hope that as 
we move forward, pass this short-term 
stimulus package that the Democratic 
Party has offered, and then move into 
long-term economic growth, that we 
really look at energy independence as a 
major pathway to new job creation and 
investment here at home. 

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, that is 
a very good point. And the other thing 
too is that everyone is sort of assuming 
that this recession is at its worst and 
somehow we are now going to turn it 
around; but if the government goes in 
the wrong direction with President 
Bush’s plan, it could very easily get 
worse. There is nothing in that plan 
that is going to stimulate the economy. 
The consequence could very well 
be that the recession gets worse and 
unemployment gets worse. I hope that 
does not happen, but I think it would 
be naive for us to suggest that we have 
necessarily hit bottom. One of the reasons 
we need to do this, what the 
Democrats propose, is that we do not 
want things to get worse. It is not just 
a question of getting better, but not 
having the economy even move in a 
further downward direction. 

Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman 
raised the unemployment numbers. 
It is interesting that recently a 
survey has come out of rural areas in 
my State, particularly areas that were 
previously timber-dependent areas, 
about unemployment; and the numbers 
that we record today in unemployment 
do not reflect the real suffering or the 
true degree of unemployment. As high 
as unemployment is in the United 
States, and it is at some of the highest 
numbers it has been in a decade under 
this administration without an extension 
of unemployment benefits, which 
hopefully will be rectified here this 
week, but the numbers are actually 
much worse because the definitions 
have been cleverly changed to say, 
well, if they are unemployed and their 
unemployment benefits have run out, 
they are not considered unemployed 
anymore in the United States. 

So if we follow that illogic through, 
if everybody in America lost their job 
today and all their benefits an out a 
year from today and nobody got their 
job back, no one would be working and 
we would have zero unemployment. It 
is an absolute absurdity. So the true 
measure of unemployment is actually 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H39 

much, much higher than we are seeing; 
and the struggle, as the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) said, to bring 
some productive capacity back to this 
country and put people back to work, 
we were all first promised, well, they 
are losing their jobs in industry but 
they will all go into the new economy. 

Well, the new economy has gone 
bust, and most of them did not get jobs 
there anyway or benefit during those 
good years; and one cannot, in my 
opinion, be a great Nation if one does 
not build things, and the reliance on 
foreign oil is extraordinary. The fact 
that our greatest balance of payment, 
the deficit, is to buy foreign oil, supporting 
people who hardly have any interest 
in the United States in mind and 
our future in mind and the investment 
in alternative fuels, alternative fuel 
technology to include fuel cells and all 
the other things that the gentlewoman 
talked about, bring those industries 
home to the United States and begin to 
export them into the rest of the world 
in addition to insulating ourselves 
from these people who are jacking up 
oil prices around the world would be an 
extraordinary benefit to the American 
people. And I hope that this administration, 
this unfortunately oil administration 
that we have in the White 
House, might be able to clear their vision 
a little bit, instead of saying we 
can somehow drill our way out of this, 
which we cannot. Even if there was as 
much oil as the most optimistic say up 
in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge 
and along the coast of the United 
States, we still could not drill our way 
out of this problem. We would still 
have a growing dependence on foreign 
oil. We need to make dramatic steps 
and investments in that direction, and 
we should orient more longer-term 
packages toward the recovery of our 
economy toward those new technologies, 
toward those investments in 
our country, and those are the kinds of 
things we need. 

An ephemeral investment or expenditure 
of $300 billion to relieve people 
from paying taxes on dividends on 
stock, mostly people who earn over 
$100,000 a year, as an economic stimulus 
is almost laughable. I mean, it is 
extraordinary to me. And if it does 
work and it stimulates the stock market 
without dealing with the underlying 
problems and the fundamentals 
of U.S. industry and their unwillingness 
to invest if this country, in the 
productive capacity of this country, it 
will create another bubble, and guess 
what, some people will ride the bubble 
up, get out, and it will pop again, and 
what happens? The people who are always 
stuck are the middle class and 
working people who cannot get in and 
out of the market because their only 
investments in the market are through 
their retirement funds which they cannot 
liquidate and speculate on the way 
that some of these other folks can. It 
may well cause a big run-up in the 
stocks that pay dividends in particular, 
but it is not going to generally leaven 

the economy and put people back to 
work. I have yet to see a single credible 
economist make that assertion, that 
somehow this $300 billion gift other 
than through the trickle-down theory 
is going to somehow put people in this 
country back to work. 

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, the 
other problem that we have too, which 
we really did not dwell on too much 
but I think it is important, is that it 
really was disgraceful that the Republicans, 
who are in the majority, with 
the President went home after December 
28 and the people that did not have 
their unemployment compensation just 
ran out. 

Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, 28,000 
people in my State alone saw an end to 
their unemployment benefits in the 
week between Christmas and New 
Year. Happy New Year from the Federal 
Government. 

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, in the 
State of Ohio it was 24,000 people who 
fell off their benefits right before the 
New Year and 1,100 additional people in 
my own congressional district. 

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, the 
amazing thing, we were trying, the 
Democrats insisted before we went 
home that we would stay here to pass 
a package, but of course the Republicans 
just adjourned. 

b1830 
My understanding is, and I have not 
seen the proposal, I guess we may consider 
something tomorrow or Thursday, 
is that the Republicans are coming 
back with something like a 12-week 
extension which may or may not even 
be retroactive. That is a very short period 
of time, given what we are facing 
here. The Democratic proposal is for 
double that, basically 26 weeks, and 
goes back to December 28. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, if the 
gentleman would keep in perspective, 
the total cost of the Democratic proposal, 
as I understand, it is to be twice 
as generous in terms of the extension 
of unemployment benefits; and to 
again, to begin to even penetrate some 
of those other people who have been 
longer unemployed or underemployed, 
is about one-twentieth, 5 percent, of 
what the President is proposing to gift 
upon the wealthiest by relieving them 
of the horrible burden of paying a 
small percentage tax on the dividends 
they earn by clipping coupons on 
stocks that they own. 
Where are our priorities? Could he 
not do 10 percent for the unemployed 
and for their families? I mean, it is just 
extraordinary to me that the emphasis 
would be so thinly disguised. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, every 
single one of those families would 
spend that money on basics. They 
would be buying food. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. From local small businesses. 
Ms. KAPTUR. From local small businesses. 
They would be shopping at local 
stores. They would be making their 
mortgage payments, if they can hold 
on to their houses. 

Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, if 
could, in my State, we have an extraordinary, 
we have already exhausted this 
year’s allocation of low-income energy 
assistance in our State; and we are, 
what, 3 months into the year, the beginning 
of the heating season; and 
there are tens of thousands of people 
on the waiting list in my State, and I 
am sure in other States across America. 
And to say, well, we just cannot afford 
those things, but we can afford for 
the people who live up on the top of the 
hill in the big houses with all of the 
lights on and the windows open, we are 
going to give them a little extra gift so 
that they can go to Antigua to avoid 
the colder months. 

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I was 
struck by the fact that here we are on 
the very first day of the 108th Congress, 
and I am proud to say it is the Democratic 
Party that is down here on the 
floor tonight talking about the economy 
and the recession and how we invest 
our way out of it; we are talking 
about war, how we avoid it; we are 
talking about new job creation for our 
country. I do not hear anything from 
the other side. I mean, it is easy to go 
to cocktail parties and leave for dinners 
because it is kind of a day of pomp 
and circumstance; on the other hand, 
we are a serious party, we are true to 
our traditions, and I want to thank the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) and the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. DEFAZIO) for being a part of 
this this evening. I am very proud to be 
a Democrat tonight. We are doing our 
job. 

Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, if I could 
expand on that, it is day 10 since the 
extended unemployment benefits expired, 
and Congress is not in official 
session this evening taking care of that 
problem. They are out, many of them 
downtown with the lobbyists on K 
Street celebrating with champagne beyond 
the weekly food budget of many 
of these families who are unemployed. 

Ms. KAPTUR. I thought we would 
have extended the unemployment benefits 
today. I promised my constituents 
that it would be my top priority when 
I came back here to Washington; and, 
quite frankly, I was surprised that that 
bill was not offered today. 

Mr. PALLONE. And we did have 
votes today. We did have the adoption 
of the rules package. So it was not that 
we only had a ceremonial session. We 
did have votes. 

The other thing is that in the last 
few weeks I was hearing from some of 
our Republican colleagues about how 
maybe we did not even need to do it, to 
extend unemployment compensation 
because it has been going on too long, 
almost like it is some sort of welfare 
benefit or something. When the recession 
continues, and it is getting worse, 
there is no indication it is getting, 
things are getting better, it is only fair 
to extend it. I mean I could not believe 
I would even have to try to argue the 
case for it. But there are those on the 
other side of the aisle who do not think 
we should even do it. 


H40 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I would 
have to say this also, that when the 
Bush administration’s unemployment 
proposal was talked about, the President 
talked about this before the first 
of the year; he did not say what his 
proposal really was. His original proposal 
would have only taken care of 
the unemployed in three States. The 
State of Oregon was one of them, but 
our State was left out, the State of 
Ohio. I fail to see how an unemployed 
worker in Ohio who has exhausted his 
benefits is any different than an unemployed 
worker in Oregon or New Jersey. 


Then there was the issue of how 
many weeks and at what level for benefits 
they had worked for. These are 
working people. They are people who 
have believed in our system of enterprise 
and have tried to make a difference 
in their lives. I was just amazed 
that none of the press talked about the 
difference in the bills, that we were as 
the Democratic Party talking about 
every State in the Union, every unemployed 
worker who had fallen off of 
benefits, and that we were talking 
about a realistic number of weeks, not 
just 6 weeks or 7 weeks, but so that 
people could plan, 26 weeks, which has 
been historic here. 

Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, we 
should remember that unemployment 
benefits have been paid for by the employers 
and the employees. The employers 
have to pay a tax; most economists 
say that comes in the form of 
lower wages or at least is shared in 
lower wages by the employees, and 
there is a large and healthy balance in 
the unemployment trust fund. Yet our 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, the President and the Republican 
majority, have refused to expend some 
of those taxes. That was money that 
was saved for a rainy day for families 
and individuals across this country. It 
is raining like hell out there right now, 
and they need that money. It is their 
money. That, in fact, does not have an 
impact on the deficit. Giving a $300 billion 
tax break to people who clip coupons 
on their taxes does cost the Federal 
Treasury and will increase the deficit, 
but if we kept the books honestly, 
money spent out of the unemployment 
trust fund which has been accumulated 
over many years for a rainy day would 
not count as money that is spent and 
created out of nothing. There is money 
there to spend. It is just like we could 
invest in infrastructure by spending 
down the highway trust fund. We could 
invest in aviation by spending down 
the aviation trust fund. We could accelerate 
a whole bunch of projects across 
this country and put people back to 
work, really. I mean, in the phony way 
we keep books here, it counts as deficit; 
but in reality it would not be. The 
American taxpayers would be getting 
the money back that they paid for the 
purpose for which it was intended, 
which is unemployment benefits or investment 
in bridges, highways, roads 
and aviation. 

Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
say a word about Amtrak. I represent 
the largest passenger terminal in Ohio, 
and it has been amazing to me to 
watch under this administration’s purview 
how service has been cut back. I 
travel around the world, and I ride 
trains that so far surpass anything 
that we have over land in this country. 
It is actually embarrassing. We talk 
about a stimulus package. What about 
high-speed rail? Why has it taken us as 
a country to this point in the 21st century 
where we have an antiquated system 
that needs new stimulus, that 
needs new investment, coast-to-coast, 
in order to meet all of the congestion 
problems we have at our airports; to 
provide a real, third rail, one might say 
over the road, in the air, and over land, 
not counting the sea ways, but to take 
a look at our rail system and the investment 
that is needed in it, and to 
think that we are cutting back to 
allow Wall Street to put our investment 
in China or Mexico or somewhere 
else. 

Mr. DEFAZIO. China is building a 
huge and very expensive multibillion 
dollar new high-speed rail system, 
probably with some U.S. investment 
behind it. 

Ms. KAPTUR. Very interesting. 
Maybe some of those Wall Street dollars 
are going to China rather than inside 
the United States. That is why it 
is important to target the investment 
here and to make sure that it builds 
wealth in our country, not someplace 
else. 

When the gentleman mentioned 
about infrastructure, that really 
struck me because northern Ohio has 
been seriously diminished in its ability 
to move passengers. And the equipment, 
the trackage, everything that we 
need really has been underinvested, 
and this is a system that when one goes 
around the world, I do not care whether 
it is France, Japan, the gentleman 
mentioned China, we are falling behind, 
falling behind. 

Mr. PALLONE. There is no question 
about that. Again, part of our Democratic 
stimulus package does provide 
for money to go back to the States for 
infrastructure, airports, highways, and 
the things that the gentlewoman mentioned. 


I think we are running out of time, so 
we are going to have to wrap it up; we 
only have a couple more minutes. But 
I just want to thank both of my colleagues. 
The bottom line is that this is 
just the beginning. The gentlewoman 
mentioned the media not comparing 
the different unemployment compensation 
packages. Part of it is because the 
Bush administration has not really 
said exactly what they are proposing. I 
gather from today that they are talking 
about 12 weeks, and we will find 
that out tomorrow. But we are going to 
have to insist beginning tomorrow that 
this package pass and pass in a way 
that is effective before we leave this 
week, let alone tonight. So I particularly 
appreciate the fact that my col


leagues mentioned that, because 
think it is something we are going to 
have to deal with literally tomorrow. 

But I thank my colleagues again, and 
we will continue to point out these differences 
between what the President is 
proposing and the Democratic stimulus 
package, not because it is partisan, but 
just because we honestly believe that 
the Republican proposal will not do 
anything to reverse the economic 
downturn. 

f 


THE DROUGHT AND ITS 
CONSEQUENCES 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
OSE). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 7, 2003, the gentleman 
from Nebraska (Mr. OSBORNE) is 
recognized for 60 minutes. 

Mr. OSBORNE. Mr. Speaker, I sat 
here with a great deal of interest listening 
to the previous speakers and the 
fact that Republicans were at cocktail 
parties and out with lobbyists, and I 
am a Republican and I am still here. I 
was very interested in the comments 
that I was listening to. I am not a very 
partisan person. I believe very much in 
fairness and balance. When I heard the 
President’s economic stimulus package 
characterized over and over again as 
another round of tax breaks for the 
rich, what I was surprised that somebody 
did not answer was that part of 
the plan is $3.6 billion going to the 
States that are to be distributed in 
$3,000 increments to the unemployed as 
they pay for transportation and child 
care and training to get back into the 
workforce. 

Now, the unemployed are not by definition 
wealthy people. So that $3.6 billion 
does not go to the rich. The child 
tax credit increases by $400 per child. 
Now, not all children, certainly in the 
United States, are born to the wealthy. 
So a family of three would have $1,200 
additional money in their pocket, and 
many of those families will be poor 
families. The marriage tax penalty has 
been accelerated. For the average married 
couple, that will mean $1,716 that 
they will receive. Certainly, not all 
married couples in the United States 
are wealthy. Many that I know are not 
wealthy at all. Mr. Speaker, 92 million 
tax filers this year will receive an average 
tax cut of $1,083. We certainly do 
not have 92 million tax filers in the 
United States this year that are 
wealthy people. 

Finally, let me just say this. There 
has been a lot of mention of the dividends 
and how the dividends were tax 
breaks for the rich. But what most people 
do not seem to bother to mention is 
that roughly 40 percent of the American 
population now owns stock. Not 
all of those 40 percent are wealthy people. 
Many average wage-earners own 
stock and will benefit from any stock 
dividend reduction. 

So just in the interest of fairness, 
Mr. Speaker, I thought we might mention 
the fact that there were some 
things that were not mentioned here 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H41 

this evening as we talked about the 
stimulus package, and I am not for 
sure what it is going to look like. I am 
not sure how it is going to play out. 
But I do know that it is not targeted 
only for the upper 5 percent or only the 
upper 10 percent of taxpayers. Certainly 
a good number of people will 
benefit. 

But that is not what I am here for tonight, 
Mr. Speaker; it is not why I 
came over here. From the previous discussion, 
one can assume that what happens 
on this floor much of the time is 
aimed at discussion of the economy, 
tax breaks have been mentioned, a lot 
of discussion about Medicare at times, 
and certainly the Middle East, what is 
going on in Iraq, what is going on in 
North Korea. And these are all very, 
very important subjects. But the subject 
that we very seldom discuss here is 
somewhat amazing to me and that is 
something that is going on right here, 
right now in the United States; and it 
involves almost one-half of the country, 
and that is the drought. We almost 
never hear that discussed on the floor 
of this House. We almost never hear it 
discussed in our major metropolitan 
areas or in our major metropolitan 
newspapers. 

So, Mr. Speaker, here is the map of 
the drought. This is what it looks like. 
In August of 2002, at the end of the 
growing season, this is what the 
drought looked like, and this was the 
impact that it had on our crops in 2002. 
So what that means, if one looks at the 
black area, that is exceptional drought; 
and those areas experienced, for the 
most part, drought that exceeded any 
records that go back over 100 years of 
recorded history of precipitation. 

b1845 
So we see large areas like this. The 
red areas would, for the most part, exceed 
the drought that we experienced 
in the thirties, the Dust Bowl, where 
tons and tons of Earth were blown 
away and crops were totally nonviable; 
and thousands and thousands of farmers 
left farming and ranching. 
So we can see, Mr. Speaker, that this 
is a rather drastic picture. The bad 
thing is, it has not improved for the 
most part. In some areas, it is much 
worse now than it was then. In my 
home State of Nebraska, the month of 
December which just passed was in 
most cases the driest December ever 
recorded, so things have not improved 
at all. 
Let us talk a little bit about why this 
is. Why do we not hear about this 
more? The reason is, I believe, that 
there are roughly 2 million farmers and 
ranchers in the United States today. 
That comprises a little bit less, actually, 
than 1 percent of the total population 
of the United States in farming 
and ranching. Probably in this drought 
area we have about one-half of the 
farmers and ranchers in our country, so 
we are talking about one-half of 1 percent 
that are directly impacted by this. 
Their way of living, their livelihood, is 

impacted by the drought. One-half of 1 
percent sometimes does not make 
much of a ripple. 

Mr. Speaker, that is why I have decided 
not to go to the cocktail parties 
and not to go out with the lobbyists tonight, 
as we have heard earlier was 
happening with the Republicans. That 
is why I am here on the floor tonight to 
talk about this, because very few other 
people are talking about it. It is something 
we need to look at because it has 
huge implications for this country, and 
for its economy and for its well-being. 

Let me talk a little bit about the effects 
of the drought. Some of these 
areas are forest lands in Wyoming and 
in Colorado. One thing that was interesting, 
in examining the rings, the 
growth rings on the trees, we can pretty 
much tell when the droughts occurred. 
Some of those trees are 300 
years old. 2002 was the driest year in 
many of those areas in the last 300 
years. The timber in those forests was 
drier than the lumber in the lumberyard 
that had been put through a kiln, 
so that shows the impact that the 
drought had on our forests and on our 
lands. 

The reservoirs in these areas that are 
stored primarily for irrigation are at 
this time 25, 30 percent, in some cases 
as low as 15 or 20 percent, full. The bad 
thing, Mr. Speaker, is that the inflows 
into those reservoirs are greatly reduced 
from other years. The snowpack 
even for this winter is way, way below 
normal, so there is almost no chance of 
any great recovery this year. So we are 
looking at some really reduced irrigation 
waters for those people who irrigate 
out of those reservoirs. 

Normally, an irrigator could count 
on somewhere between 90 and 100 days 
of water. This year, many of those 
irrigators have already been told that 
those reservoirs will only provide 
maybe 20 to 30 days of water, which 
means essentially that they cannot 
plant, because they cannot grow anything 
on 20 to 30 days of water. 

Also, many people who would receive 
normally 20 to 24 inches of water out of 
a reservoir this year are going to receive 
2 or 3 inches of water; so again, 
those people are having to convert to 
dry land. They are having to put their 
irrigated land into pastures and other 
types of products, and as a result there 
is a tremendous financial loss in those 
areas. The pastures in these areas have 
simply dried up, so there is no hay. 
There is nothing for the cattle to eat. 
As a result, what has happened is a 
great many of our ranchers have had to 
sell at least part, and in some cases 
nearly all, of their cattle. 

The problem with that is that when 
we start reducing the breeding stock, 
and some of these breeding stocks have 
been put up over generations and of 
course have tremendous value, but 
when they can no longer provide food 
for them and they have to sell the 
breeding stock, then it is not long before 
the whole thing unravels, and it 
will take 5, 6, 7, or 8 years to rebuild 

the breeding stock. There has been tremendous 
devastation in these areas, 
particularly in the livestock industry. 

On top of the farmers and ranchers, 
we also find that the small towns that 
really service those farmers and ranchers 
are in bad shape, too, because the 
implement dealers, the feed and seed 
dealers, have no money. The merchants, 
the bankers, all of these people 
are experiencing extreme hardship in 
these areas. 

Currently, just in my State alone, 
the State of Nebraska, the economic 
devastation of this particular drought 
is estimated to be $1.4 billion. That was 
as of September or October. My estimation 
is it will probably go closer to 
$2 billion. If we multiply that by Kansas, 
South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, 
Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona, 
all of these other States, we are 
talking about a disaster in the range of 
15 to $20 billion. This is huge for this 
part of the country, and it is something 
that we need to think about and 
we need to do something about. 

In Nebraska, the nonrenewable farm 
loans this year will increase by roughly 
400 percent which, if that plays out, 
and I believe that it will, we will probably 
lose somewhere between 3,000 and 
4,000 farmers. 

The most terrifying statistic that we 
heard recently that the bankers gave 
me was that 25 to 50 percent of the 
farm loans in the State of Nebraska are 
in serious trouble, and they could not 
endure another 2002. They would go 
under if we do not do any better; and, 
of course, the drought appears to be as 
bad in the coming year as it was in the 
past year, which would mean that we 
could lose as many as 15,000 to 20,000 
farmers that would not be able to 
renew their farm loans. 

So this is a very difficult prospect. It 
is something that is, I believe, unconscionable 
to not address. This is something 
that has to be done. 

What has been done so far to combat 
the drought? I think, in fairness to the 
administration, we need to point out 
the fact that they did provide $752 million 
in livestock compensation this 
past fall. This was taken out of section 
32 of USDA. It did not require an act or 
any initiative here in the Congress, but 
it was done administratively. This 
money was greatly appreciated. 

There was also a livestock feed program 
that allowed ranchers to get 
vouchers to go down to feed stores and 
they could purchase some feed. Some 
people purchased their hay up on the 
Canadian border, and said that might 
help get them through the winter; so it 
was some help, but it is something that 
was maybe just a stopgap measure. The 
people in the ranching business are 
still in great difficulty; and the bottom 
line is that nothing so far has been 
done for the row crops, the people who 
grow wheat and corn and milo and soybeans. 
They have not received any type 
of aid at all. 

So let us take a look at what has 
been going on in terms of disaster. We 


H42 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 7, 2003 

see that for Hurricane Andrew and a 
typhoon $6.4 billion were spent by the 
United States Government; for the 1997 
flood of a river, $738 million. These, of 
course, are not due to drought. 

We every year give $5.59 billion to 
Israel, $3.94 billion to Egypt, and we 
give to many, many other countries 
where we are certainly concerned 
about their welfare. I certainly do not 
begrudge the money given to Israel or 
Egypt or whatever, but the interesting 
thing is that we do these things, and 
yet we seem to be at the present time 
turning our backs on a large segment 
of the United States, which is a little 
bit difficult to understand at this 
point. 

We say, now, why would we do this? 
Why do we turn our backs on our own 
people? A memo from the budget office 
said that a drought really is not like a 
natural disaster such as a flood or a 
tornado or a hurricane because a 
drought comes on more slowly. Since it 
comes on more slowly, then people 
have a chance to adjust; so they said a 
drought really is not something like 
other disasters that get disaster aid. It 
does not quite qualify. This was what 
somebody in the budget office wrote. 

I would have to believe that that person 
maybe had not been in agriculture, 
had not been on a farm, did not know 
much about it. We have the input costs 
to till the soil, buy a tractor, plant the 
seed; we have to fertilize; and after you 
have spent thousands of dollars to get 
the crop ready, then if you do not get 
any water, it may only take about 3 
weeks at the right time and you lose 
the whole crop. 

So to say it does not come on suddenly, 
it may not be 15 minutes or 1 
day, but it does not take very long. We 
have had huge numbers of people out 
there who have simply lost their whole 
crop, it has occurred fairly quickly, 
and it was beyond their control. There 
was nothing that they could do about 
it. 

The other thing that I think has 
caused us to not come forward with 
any disaster aid has been the perception 
of the new farm bill that was 
passed last year. People would say, how 
in the world would that affect whether 
we had disaster aid or not? The perception 
of the new farm bill is that it has 
a huge amount of money in it; and because 
there is so much money in the 
farm bill, then that should take care of 
whatever disaster we might have. 

I would say that that perception is 
not accurate. I would like to show the 
Members some information here that I 
think pretty much illustrates this. 

In the last 3 years with the Freedom 
to Farm, the previous farm bill, we 
spent on average in 1999, in 2000, and 
2001 $24.5 billion, $24.5 billion. The new 
farm bill that was passed this last year 
is projected to cost a little less than 
$21 billion in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005, 
so actually there will be less money 
spent in the new farm bill than there 
was in the last 3 years of the old farm 
bill. So it does not seem to be quite as 

expensive as what we would have been 
led to believe. 

Now, the reason that the farm bill I 
think has gotten such a bad rap is that 
many of the urban newspapers really 
went after the President for signing 
the farm bill. I will read just a few of 
the editorial comments that we saw. 

First of all, in the Las Vegas Review 
Journal the headline was ‘‘Farm Welfare.’’ 
The editorial said, ‘‘The House 
voted to slide backwards some 70 years, 
choosing socialism and abandoning 
market-based reforms in the Nation’s 
Stalinesque farm policy in voting for a 
new farm bill.’’ 

The Washington Post, the headline 
was, ‘‘Cringe for Mr. Bush.’’ The editorial 
ran: ‘‘Mr. Bush signed a farm bill 
that represents a low point in his presidency, 
a wasteful corporate welfare 
measure that penalizes taxpayers and 
the world’s poorest people in order to 
bribe a few voters.’’ So the President 
took a tremendous beating here. 

In the Wall Street Journal, the headline 
was, ‘‘The Farm State Pig-out.’’ 
The editorial said, ‘‘That great rooting, 
snooting noise you hear in the distance, 
dear taxpayers, is the sound of 
election year farm State politics rolling 
out of the U.S. Congress. This alone 
amounts to one of the greatest urbanto-
rural transfers of wealth in history, 
a sort of Farm Belt Great Society.’’ 

So it is only natural that the administration, 
after enduring this type of 
reaction, would say that they are very 
reluctant to step forward at this point 
with any further spending for agriculture. 
The thing we need to understand, 
however, is that some of the 
emergency payments that were paid to 
agriculture in 1999, 2000, and 2001 were 
paid out because of low prices. The 
prices were very low, so to keep farmers 
in business some emergency payments 
were given. 

For instance, the price of corn during 
this period, a bushel of corn, probably 
averaged about $1.70, $1.80 a bushel. 
The cost of production was around $2.20 
a bushel, so in order to keep people in 
business some emergency payments 
were made. We are not talking about 
emergency payments anymore. We are 
not talking about that; we are talking 
about a natural disaster. So this is not 
because of low prices. 

The next thing we will look at here is 
what has happened this year. This is 
the projection, the new farm bill for 
2002, roughly $19 billion. Let us see 
what has actually happened this year 
with the drought. 

What has actually happened, Mr. 
Speaker, is that the $19 billion projected 
spending has not occurred. Instead, 
this year the farm bill will cost 
somewhere between $13 billion and $14 
billion, a $5 billion to $6 billion shortfall. 
In other words, in the year 2002, we 
will actually spend about one-half of 
what we spent on average on the farm 
bill in 1999, 2000, and 2001; and yet this 
is being called the great farm State 
pig-out, that this is a fat bill. Obviously 
that is not true. We are spending 

roughly one-half of what we spent in 
the last 3 years of Freedom to Farm. 

We will say, why did this happen? 
How could it have happened? What happened 
was the drought. What happened 
was that in corn production, in soybeans, 
in milo, in rye we are down 
about 10 or 15 percent because of the 
drought. Some people simply had no 
crops. When we have less supply, then 
the price goes up. When the price goes 
up, we have no farm supports. When 
people in Iowa, in Illinois, in Indiana 
have good crops and they have better 
prices, they get no farm payments because 
their prices are up. So as a result, 
‘‘we’’ are saving, in quotes, we the 
government, somewhere in the neighborhood 
of $6 billion on this farm bill. 

b1900 
So the question would be, well, why 
would we not give some of that $6 billion 
back to the people who caused it 
to happen in the first place, the people 
who had no crops, the people who experienced 
the drought? Because you get 
no farm payments if you do not have a 
crop. And that is what happened to 
these people. They have no crop. And 
so it would make sense to a lot of people 
that, yes, we would return some of 
that. But again we do not seem to be 
getting any movement in any direction. 
And the staple answer we get is, 
well, there is so much money in the 
farm bill, just take it out of the farm 
bill. 
Now, the problem that we have with 
that as we looked at the map, we can 
see that there was only part of the 
country that had the drought. And so 
we would have to convince the folks in 
Iowa, in Illinois, in Indiana, in Minnesota, 
in Texas, in Arkansas and Louisiana 
that they should take payment 
from their crops to give to South Dakota 
and North Dakota and Nebraska 
and Kansas and Colorado, and it seems 
that that is rather difficult to get 
done. People just do not seem to want 
to do that. 
So what has happened is we are between 
a rock and a hard place. We cannot 
seem to get the administration to 
say, yes, we will help the farmers; and 
we cannot get many people saying, yes, 
we ought to go into the farm bill, and 
I can see that too. So as a result we 
have a lot of people who are hurting, 
who are in bad shape; and I really do 
not know exactly what we are going to 
do at the present time. 
Let us talk a little bit more about 
the farm bill. This thing is greatly misunderstood. 
People do not understand 
why we have a farm bill. And so I 
would like to present one last graphic 
here, Mr. Speaker, and this is rationale 
as I see it for why we have a farm bill. 
Farming is a little bit different than 
most other industries. People who have 
WallMart come in their community 
and the hardware store goes broke, 
they say, nobody helps me. I used to be 
a football coach and if I lost a game nobody 
protected me and so they say, 
why should we help the farmers? Let 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H43 

me tell you a little bit of the rationale 
that holds up very well. 

First of all, farming is almost totally 
weather dependent. Now, most industries, 
most businesses in our country 
do not dissolve if you have a 15-minute 
hailstorm or if it does not rain for 3 
weeks or if a strong wind comes 
through and knocks the wheat down. It 
does not happen that way, but farming 
is totally weather dependent. 

Number two, in farming it is almost 
impossible to control the inventory. 
You say, well, what does that mean? 
Well, if General Motors has too many 
automobiles out there and they feel 
there is a glut what they do is shut 
down an assembly line and they wait 
until things get in balance. But when 
you are growing wheat around the 
world, you really cannot say, well, 
Australia, you do not plant this year 
or, Canada, you cut down because you 
do not know what the worldwide production 
will be. You do not know where 
the droughts are going to be. You do 
not know what is going to happen so 
you cannot control the inventory. Now 
most businesses can control the inventory. 


Thirdly, producers do not set the 
price. If you are going to make a suit 
of clothes you will say, this is worth 
$500. This is what we will price it at. 
We will make a box of corn flakes. It 
will be $2.50. If we are going to sell a 
car it will be $30,000. So the manufacturer, 
the producer sets the price. But 
in farming the farmer does not set the 
price. The price is set for him. It is the 
local elevator, the Chicago Board of 
Trade that says corn is worth $1.60 a 
bushel this week, so much a pound for 
beef. And he has no choice. He does not 
set the price. 

Fourthly, farming is critical to national 
security. As long as you can go 
down to the grocery store and things 
are convenient and easy and there is 
plenty there, and you only spend an average 
of 9 percent of your income on 
food you do not really see a problem. 
There is no problem with national security. 
But those countries that experienced 
a shortage of food in World War 
II have a little bit different slant on 
things. And the other thing that we 
want to point out here in regard to national 
security, somebody mentioned 
in the previous hour, they were talking 
about petroleum, our dependence on 
OPEC for oil. Well, what happened was 
about 20 years ago we found that we 
could buy petroleum from OPEC for 
like $15, $20 a barrel. So we said that is 
a good deal. So we should shut down 
our own exploration. We shut down our 
own refineries. As a result we are now 
60 percent dependent so foreign. 

People say that is still okay because 
we only pay $12 to $15 a barrel. That is 
no problem. But some economists have 
put a pencil to it and said the Gulf War 
cost us a lot of money, and the Gulf 
War was about oil. And we are maintaining 
a fleet and a military presence 
in the Middle East and we are now 
maintaining an even bigger presence 

which is due largely to oil. And what 
economists have said was that oil really 
does not cost us $15 a barrel. What it 
cost was more like $70 to $100 a barrel 
when you add it all in. 

Now, we can do the same thing to our 
agriculture. We can very quickly ship 
our agriculture to South America, to 
Australia, to Canada. And so the question 
is are we going to protect agriculture 
and are we going to keep it in 
the United States where we know what 
we have, and we have a secure food supply, 
and no matter what happens 
around the world we know we have got 
it here. Is that worth something to us? 
I think it is. 

Fifthly, there is no level playing field 
worldwide. The European Union subsidizes 
agriculture by more than $300 
per acre. Now, again, you go back to 
toward World War II and most people 
in Europe understand the value of a 
food supply so they subsidize $300 per 
acre. Japan subsidizes agriculture more 
than $1,000 per acre. In the United 
States, get this, the United States, 
that fat farm state pig out farm bill 
subsidizes agriculture $45 per acre, 
roughly one-sixth of what the European 
Union subsidizes their farmers. 

The other thing to remember is that 
there is great competition from South 
America. In Brazil, for instance, a top 
grade of land will cost $250 per acre, 
land that would probably cost $2,500 an 
acre here in the United States. Labor 
costs an average of 50 cents an hour in 
Brazil. It would probably cost $10 an 
hour in the United States. And there 
are practically no environmental regulations 
in Brazil where we have a great 
many. 

So what we are saying is that the 
farm bill is necessary to enable our agriculture 
to be somewhat competitive 
and we think we are getting a pretty 
good bargain here at $45 per acre. And 
so is that agriculture worth saving? Is 
that worth some type of investment in 
terms of disaster payment to keep that 
here, to keep it in the United States, to 
keep these people viable? I guess my 
slant, Mr. Speaker, is, yes, it is. And so 
that is pretty much my rationale this 
evening. 

I guess one last comment, some people 
would say, well, we do not have any 
disaster aid because, number one, the 
drought is not a natural disaster; and 
of course I think I pretty well disputed 
that. Secondly, they have said the farm 
bill is too fat; and again I think we 
have offered some information to dispute 
that. 

But the third argument is this, that, 
well, that those people who have row 
crops have crop insurance so they do 
not need any help. Well, I think people 
in the United States need to understand 
the crop insurance program is 
viable and it is very important. It 
works very well if you have three or 
four good years, good yields and good 
production, and then all of the sudden 
you have a drought for 1 year and 
maybe then you have 3 or 4 more good 
years because the crop insurance will 

at least hold you in there. It will get 
the input costs back, because the most 
insurance you can buy for crop insurance 
is 85 percent. Now, profitability is 
in the last 10 percent. So on crop insurance 
you do not make money. You 
probably still lose a little bit. But the 
problem is that when you have multiple 
years of drought, which we have 
had. Most of these farmers have experienced 
at least 2, 3, 4, some of them 5 
years of drought. Every year of 
drought that you have the amount of 
insurance you can buy goes down because 
you have to average in those 
years where you had no production. 

So probably most of the farmers in 
those drought areas are insured at a 60, 
65 percent level and they have been receiving 
that now for 2 and 3 years. So 
they have been digging into their equity 
every year and some of them are 
to the point where they no longer have 
any equity left. So insurance is good 
for a 1-year situation, but when you 
have multiple years of drought which 
we have had, you have a disaster. And 
so that is where I believe at this point 
we need to step in. 

So we hope very much that this body, 
in the House, we hope in the Senate 
and we hope that the administration 
will begin to see what we are up 
against and the difficulty of the situation. 
We hope this will be treated like 
a natural disaster, like a hurricane, 
like a flood, like a fire. And typically 
the United States has stepped forward 
in those situations, and it is difficult 
to stand back and see a lack of responses 
in this case. 

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity.

United States 
of America PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATES OF THE 108th 
CONGRESS, FIRST SESSION 

Vol. 149 WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JANUARY 7, 2003 No. 1 

The seventh day of January being the 
day prescribed by Senate Joint Resolution 
53 for the meeting of the 1st session 
of the 108th Congress, the Senate 
assembled in its Chamber at the Capitol 
and at 12 noon was called to order 
by the Vice President (Mr. CHENEY). 

PRAYER 

The Chaplain, Dr. Lloyd John 
Ogilvie, offered the following prayer: 

Almighty God, we are one Nation 
under Your sovereignty, one body of 
leaders ready to be led by You, one 
band of patriots called to love You and 
serve our Nation above party or personal 
popularity, one family charged to 
work together in spite of differences to 
achieve Your will for our society. 
Today is an awesome time of dedication 
for the Senators-elect who will 
make an unreserved commitment to 
You, our beloved Nation, and our cherished 
Constitution. Give them a vision 
of their potential greatness as leaders; 
make them riverbeds for the flow of 
Your wisdom. Thank You for the families 
that nurtured them, the mentors 
who help them realize their talents and 
the power of Your gifts, and the loved 
ones who now stand by them to uphold 
and sustain them. May the vows they 
are about to take engender in them 
true humility. Save them from the seduction 
of power, political aggrandizement, 
and the bogus might of manipulation. 
With only You to please, set 
them free to speak truth, honed by 
study and prayer, to discern what is 
right and do it regardless of who gets 
the credit, to be distinguished for their 
integrity. All of the Senators and Officers 
of the Senate join with these new 
Senators once again in putting You 
and their families first, the good of the 
Nation second, consensus around truth, 
third; party loyalties, fourth; and, last 
of all, personal success. The time for 
greatness is now; the place for greatness 
is here; and the secret of greatness 
is in constant dependence on Your 
guidance and strength! You are our 
Lord and Saviour. Amen.

OPENING OF THE 108TH CONGRESS 
Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, 35 of our 
colleagues have just sworn the oath of 
a United States Senator. I wish to congratulate 
all 35 of our colleagues, the 
11 new Members and the 24 returning to 
this Chamber. I also want to welcome 
back to the Senate the rest of our esteemed 
colleagues, the former Members 
and the many friends that we have 
with us today, and family members— 
all who have joined us on what is truly 
a historic day as we convene the 108th 
Congress. 
The very special tradition that we 
have just witnessed dates back to that 
first Congress in 1789, when that oath 
was a very simple one sentence, the 
oath being: 
I do solemnly swear that I will support the 
Constitution of the United States. 
Those words in the version that we 
just heard recited—when you come 
down to the essence—are a truly sacred 
bond that we all share in this body, regardless 
of what status, what State, 
what party, or what rank and what 
creed we represent. 
Indeed, it is my hope that in this 
Congress we will be defined by achievement 
as well as a cooperative spirit. 
At this point in time, our Nation 
faces truly historic challenges—winning 
the war against terror, boosting 
economic growth, job creation, addressing 
multiple health care challenges 
that now have become crises, 
and ensuring our agenda is inclusive of 
all Americans. 
I look forward to working with our 
colleagues both on our side of the aisle 
and on the other side of the aisle—in 
particular with my colleague from 
South Dakota, Senator DASCHLE—to 
ensure that we succeed. I am convinced 
that we will find, based on our own 
principles, common ground to bridge 
this aisle between us. 
As majority leader of the Senate, I 
pledge to serve this body, to serve the 
people of Tennessee, and to serve the 
American people to the best of my ability. 
I will remain guided by those same 
timeless principles of our founding documents. 
And, above all, I hope to enable 
this body to continue to contribute 
to the greatness of all Americans. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
democratic leader. 

f 


THE SENATE AT ITS BEST 
Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me 
congratulate the majority leader on his 
ascension to his new responsibilities 
and on his remarks just now. I have little 
doubt that we will be led well, and 
we will be led fairly. I look forward to 
working with him, as I know my whole 
caucus does as well. 
I also congratulate our 35 returning 
colleagues—those 11 new Members and 
24 Senators who are returning. There 
can be no more awesome responsibility 
than to sit at these historic desks—especially 
as we begin the 108th Congress. 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S9 

Let me also thank my colleagues for 
their support, for their encouragement, 
and for the friendship they have given 
me these many months and years. At 
this time in particular in my life, I am 
extraordinarily grateful for that. I 
wish to express that in the most heartfelt 
way. 

The 107th Congress was filled with 
history—filled in the way we elected a 
President, the way we governed as a 50– 
50 Senate, and in the way we addressed 
so many issues. I have no doubt that 
the momentous decisions made during 
the 107th Congress will be recorded and 
reported and analyzed and considered 
for generations to come. We begin a 
new Congress and a new day with a new 
spirit and a new mood for the recognition 
of new responsibilities and a new 
opportunity to write history. 

Just yesterday, as I was coming back 
from South Dakota, an older woman 
stopped me in the airport. She pulled 
me at my arm. And she said: Senator 
DASCHLE, do your best. Do your best, 
and remember that history is in your 
hands. 

I think that is our charge—to do our 
best, to recognize that history is now 
in our hands, and that as we face the 
challenges and the responsibilities as 
Senators in the 108th Congress, I hope 
we can look back with satisfaction, 
with pride and with a realization that, 
indeed, we did our best. 

(Applause, Senators rising.) 

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader is recognized.

now proceed to the consideration of S. 
23, an unemployment insurance extension 
bill introduced today by Senators 
FITZGERALD, CLINTON, and others; further, 
that the bill be read the third 
time and passed, and the motion to reconsider 
be laid upon the table. 

Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object—— 

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from New York. 

Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that there be one 
amendment in order which would provide 
benefits for those who have previously 
exhausted their Federal unemployment 
benefits—approximately 1 
million Americans and over 150,000 New 
Yorkers—that there be a time limitation 
on the amendment of 30 minutes 
for debate, equally divided in the usual 
form, and that no other amendments or 
motions be in order to the bill. 

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is 
there objection? 

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I object. 


Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, a number of Senators 
on both sides of the aisle have 
been very aggressively working on this 

legislation for, indeed, several months 
and most intensively over the last several 
days. I believe we have reached a 
bipartisan agreement to allow us to 
pass the bill today so that the House 
will consider it and in order for it to 
become public law this week. 

As most of my colleagues in the Senate 
Chamber know, if this bill is not 
passed by Thursday and signed by the 
President of the United States, there 
will be tremendous dislocation among 
the American people. With that, I urge 
that we proceed with the underlying 
unanimous consent. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
ALLEN). Is there objection to the initial 
request? 

Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I thank the 
majority leader for bringing this very 
important matter to the floor so early 
in our session. I also thank my colleague 
from Oklahoma, Senator NICKLES, 
for working with me and others 
over the last week to try to reach consensus. 
While I do not object at all to 
this final bill—in fact, I am a lead 
Democratic sponsor—I would point out 
that passage of this bill, as important 
as it is, will leave many, many people 
without any means of support, and I 
think that we must turn our attention 
to these people who have exhausted 
their benefits. I look forward to working 
with the majority and minority 
leader in doing so. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Democratic leader. 

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I would simply 
also commend those responsible for 
bringing the resolution to this point. 
We could have accomplished this in the 
last Congress, but we were unable to 
complete our work. I remind my colleagues 
that by simply passing this resolution 
we are leaving out over 1 million 
people who have absolutely no recourse 
and have no assistance whatsoever 
because their benefits have expired. 
We are leaving them out. This 
will only address those who are about 
to see their benefits expire—about one-
half of the 1 million people who otherwise 
would be eligible for these benefits. 


To simply say we are doing half 
means that we are doing half the job. 
We are leaving half on the table. We 
are leaving 1 million people with absolutely 
no recourse in their efforts to 
try to bring about any quality of life in 
these difficult times. 

So I urge my colleagues to reconsider. 
We will continue to offer this 
with the hope that we can find some 
resolution, that we can include all 2 
million unemployed workers, and that 
we do so as quickly as is possible. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 

The Senator from Rhode Island. 

Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, as I understand it, 
if we do not accept the unanimous consent 
request proposed by the Senator 
from New York, we will leave 1 million 

Americans without unemployment 
compensation benefits at a time they 
desperately need it. I also understand 
her amendment simply calls for 30 minutes 
of debate and a vote. I think it 
would be appropriate to vote. 

If the majority leader can give us 
some indication as to when we will deal 
with the issue of these 1 million people 
who will be without benefits, I think it 
might help us as we try to respond and 
decide on this issue. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from New Mexico. 

Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, and I will 
not object, while the Senators who had 
expressed their concerns may be correct, 
I believe we should commend 
those who have worked so hard to get 
this bill here, and our majority leader 
for bringing it up today because, while 
we wait to do some more, if more is 
needed, we will leave all of the unemployed 
without any new benefits. That 
is the issue. To do it today is to do it 
the way it is proposed. To debate it, or 
send it back to committee for refinement, 
means none of them will get benefits—
not only those who have run out 
of benefits, but there will be no extension 
and no money. 

I believe it is good that we comment, 
but it is better that we proceed and get 
the bill done. 

Several Senators addressed the 
Chair. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Nevada. 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to our 
taking a recess, we begged the administration 
to do something to allow us to 
pass unemployment benefits for the 
people we knew would be out of unemployment 
benefits. We in Nevada now 
have thousands of people who need 
those benefits. I heard my friend from 
New York say there are 150,000 people 
who need them in her State. I believe 
that is the figure she used. But regardless, 
there are thousands and thousands 
of people all over this country, adding 
up to a million, who need these benefits. 


We on this side of the aisle believe we 
should do everything. I have to respectfully 
say to my friend, the majority 
leader, and his colleagues, the reason 
they are not going to allow us to vote 
is we would win the vote. We would win 
if we were allowed to vote to include 
all 2 million people who are desperately 
in need of these unemployment 
checks. We would win the vote. 

I do not believe we should adjourn 
today until this matter is resolved. We 
want a vote. The people of America 
want a vote. The people we are leaving 
out are the ones who are in most need. 
There is no question the people we 
would help by passing this resolution 
need the help, but the million people 
are those who are chronically unemployed 
and are in desperate need of 
help. 

We should not adjourn today until we 
are allowed to have a vote on this most 


S10 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

important resolution with the amendment 
that has been offered by the Senator 
from New York. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Washington. 

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, it is important 
that we take care of these individuals 
who will be left out without the 
amendment by Senator CLINTON. The 
issue is, unemployment benefits not 
only help these individuals who have 
lost their jobs through no fault of their 
own—whether it is the Boeing Company 
in a downturn or other people impacted 
by 9/11 who have lost their jobs 
and need these unemployment benefits—
but more importantly, unemployment 
benefits are also an economic 
stimulus. Economists have said every 
$1 spent on unemployment insurance 
generates $2.15 of economic stimulus. 

I can think of no better package for 
us to support in a bipartisan fashion 
than putting more dollars into our 
local economies that are hurting. I 
know our State, with one of the highest 
unemployment rates in the country, 
has an economic forecast that says 
the next 6 months will not get any better. 
So if not today, I say to my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle, 
when will we realize this is an economic 
stimulus package that we must 
support. 

Several Senators addressed the 
Chair. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Pennsylvania. 

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, my 
understanding is this unemployment 
extension mirrors the unemployment 
extension we did in the last session of 
Congress. We extended benefits for 13 
weeks. 

There are some for which the 26 
weeks plus the 13 weeks have expired. I 
assume the million people we are talking 
about are those people in places 
where there is not high unemployment, 
who do not qualify for an additional 13 
weeks above the 13 weeks that have already 
been extended. 

As you know, under this bill, as 
under the prior bill, in States where 
there are high rates of unemployment, 
people do get 26 weeks, the 13 plus 13. 
So what you are talking about is a million 
people, in places where there are 
lower rates of unemployment, not getting 
an additional 13 weeks on top of 
the 13 weeks they now get on top of the 
26 weeks which the original unemployment 
act provided. 

So when we talk about people being 
left out, what we are talking about is a 
change in what the original extension 
is. I am not too sure that is being left 
out. Those are people who went 
through their 26 weeks, went through 
their 13 weeks, and have still not been 
able to find a job but are not in States 
with high unemployment. 

So what we are doing is extending 
last year’s unemployment benefits to 
this year. I think that is a fair way to 
start. It is a way to get things done. If 
you want to change unemployment ex


tension and turn it into 26 weeks, we 
can have that debate. But to suggest 
we are leaving people out, I am not too 
sure that is really what is factually 
happening in this situation. 

Several Senators addressed the 
Chair. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority 
leader. 

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response 
to the question by the Senator 
from Rhode Island, it is clear we are 
not solving the problem today. Because 
of the reality of scheduling, and in part 
because of what happened in the last 
Congress, we are faced with the reality 
that if we do not act today, there are 
going to be as many as 750,000 people 
who will have a disruption in benefits 
as of Thursday. I believe the House is 
going out tomorrow. 

We have a compromise on both sides 
of the aisle we have been working on 
that was agreed to—worked on by Senators 
CLINTON, FITZGERALD, NICKLES, 
SPECTER, CANTWELL, and a range of 
people. 

I understand what we are doing 
today, if this is accepted by unanimous 
consent, is taking care of the 750,000 
people who will be able to continue to 
receive their benefits. I know there is a 
lot more to do. 

I am not sure it is necessary to go 
over everything that is in the bill. Basically, 
what the compromise does is 
extend unemployment benefits from 
December 28—which was while we were 
all out on vacation—up until June 1, 
2003, which is an additional 5 months of 
coverage. That is what we would be 
agreeing to today, well recognizing 
there are other issues in addition to 
this that we are going to have to do as 
we go forward on this issue. 

The compromise, I should also add, 
since some of the details were brought 
up, also provides coverage allowing 
benefits to be phased out rather than 
just shut off immediately when the 
program ends. 

President Bush has made it very 
clear that the extension of unemployment 
benefits is a top priority. On both 
sides of the aisle, we have tried to 
come together. Given the circumstances 
of having been on our recent 
holiday, I would like to see us respond 
in a timely manner, meaning 
now, through the unanimous consent 
request, recognizing there is more 
work to do as we go forward. 

The President, as we speak, or in the 
last hours, has addressed other parts of 
reemployment. At the end of the day, 
people want the checks, but what they 
really want are the jobs. There are 
other ways we will continue to address 
that in the future. 

I urge my colleagues, very soon, to 
take the regular order—I will not call 
for it at this point—so we can take this 
first important step very significant to 
the American people, many of whom 
are not going to see their checks unless 
we act, and act today. 

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of extending the tem


porary extended unemployment compensation 
program. 

In March of last year, Congress enacted 
the ‘‘Job Creation and Worker 
Assistance Act of 2002.’’ This Act created 
a temporary program to provide 
additional unemployment benefits to 
workers in every State. 

Specifically, this program provided 
up to 13 weeks of federally funded employment 
benefits for workers who become 
unemployed and exhaust their 
regular State unemployment benefits. 
In addition, the program provided up to 
13 weeks of additional benefits in high 
unemployment States—that’s a maximum 
of 26 weeks. 

When this extended benefit program 
was originally enacted last year, it was 
scheduled to expire at the end of 2002. 

Unfortunately, the economy has not 
performed as well as we all hoped and 
the unemployment rate in many States 
continued to rise throughout last year. 

As my colleagues may recall, the 
Senate agreed to a unanimous consent 
request last year to extend the deadline. 
Unfortunately, the 107th Congress 
adjourned before reaching a final 
agreement on the extension. 

So, we are here again today seeking 
unanimous consent to extend the temporary 
extended unemployment compensation 
program. 

This agreement which has been cosponsored 
by Senators FITZGERALD, 
SPECTER, COLLINS, GREGG, NICKLES, and 
CLINTON would provide a 5-month extension 
of the program through the end 
of May. This agreement has been 
reached in consultation with the House 
Leadership. 

I believe a 5-month extension is an 
appropriate timeframe to see how the 
economy will perform this year, as well 
as give Congress the opportunity to 
consider further economic stimulus 
legislation. 

Our goal should be make sure that 
everyone who wants a job gets a paycheck, 
instead of just an unemployment 
check. 

I also believe it is important to point 
out that although the program expired 
last week, if we can get this measure 
through the House and onto the President’s 
desk by Thursday, no one will 
miss a check. 

Unemployment benefits are the 
bridges that help people get from one 
job to another. These benefits are not 
huge, but they’re certainly better than 
nothing for those who are out of work 
and desperately looking for jobs. People 
have to put food on the table. They 
have to heat their homes. They have to 
buy their kids clothes, shoes and 
school supplies. Their needs are immediate, 
and they need immediate relief. 

While Congress is approving unemployment 
benefits, we need to do everything 
in our power to create jobs. I 
don’t mean just any jobs, but quality 
opportunities that pay enough income 
to sustain families and build careers. I 
look forward to working with my colleagues 
and the President on creating 
jobs. Americans are the world’s greatest 
workforce. Folks need and deserve 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S11 

to use their abilities and skills to the 
fullest. 

According to the Department of 
Labor, more than 780,000 individuals 
were collecting extended benefits in 
mid-December. If we act now to extend 
this program, workers who qualified 
before December 28th will be able to 
continue receiving their weekly benefit 
check without interruption. 

I urge my colleagues to support this 
measure. 

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to join my colleagues today as 
cosponsor of the measure that will extend 
unemployment insurance benefits. 
We have a long bipartisan tradition of 
extending unemployment benefits during 
periods of prolonged joblessness. 
We have this policy because it is the 
right thing to do for people and for the 
economy. Before I present the case for 
why extended unemployment benefits 
are needed—a case which by now almost 
everyone agrees with—I want to 
remind my colleagues why we are at 
this point today. 

Led by the late Senator Wellstone, 
several of my colleagues and I, began 
this discussion last September. At that 
point it appeared clear that this economy 
was still in a weak, ‘jobless recovery.’ 
Yet, the administration failed to 
understand the basic economic reality, 
and consequently refused to support an 
extension of benefits. During the next 2 
months the economy remained weak 
and more jobs were lost. My colleagues 
and I returned to the Senate floor repeatedly, 
attempting to pass a reasonable 
extension of unemployment insurance 
benefits. We asked for unanimous 
consent eight times, each time pointing 
out the weak economy, the lack of 
job creation, the growing number of 
Americans who had exhausted their 
benefits, and the upcoming cliff that 
more Americans were facing, should 
Congress fail to act. All this while the 
President remained silent. 

Finally, at the eleventh hour of the 
last Congress, on November 14, we 
came to an agreement within the Senate. 
And I would like to thank Senators 
CLINTON, CANTWELL and NICKLES 
for their leadership in reaching that 
compromise. That compromise was 
needed in order to prevent almost 1 
million Americans who should have received 
benefits from having their benefits 
terminated. But even that compromise, 
which passed the Senate by 
unanimous consent, failed to elicit the 
support of the President. And without 
his urging the House failed to act. 

Now finally, today we are passing 
this compromise again. Actually we 
are passing a slightly improved version 
which will last for five months, providing 
individuals with the opportunity 
to begin receiving extended benefits 
until June 1st, and allowing all of 
those who begin to receive their benefits 
to receive the full 13 weeks, in the 
event that they are unable to find a 
job. And it is my understanding that if 
the House acts on this tomorrow, and 
the President signs this measure by 

Thursday, that everyone who should 
receive a benefit will continue to do so. 

However, even with passage of this 
measure, there is still significant work 
that needs to be done. This legislation, 
despite the valiant efforts of some of 
my colleagues, fails to provide benefits 
to those who have already exhausted 
their benefits and are still unable to 
find a job. There are an estimated 1 
million Americans who are in such a 
position. They are in such a position 
because the economy has continued to 
remain weak and is failing to create 
jobs. 

The latest unemployment report 
showed unemployment at an 8 year 
high of six percent. We have 2.17 million 
fewer private sector jobs today 
than when President Bush took office. 
We lost 48,000 private sector jobs last 
month alone. 

As a result of the lack of jobs, there 
are over 1.7 million Americans who 
have been unemployed and looking for 
work for more than 26 weeks. There are 
150,000 more long-term unemployed 
than in September and over 1 million 
more than when President Bush took 
office. Over 20 percent of those who are 
unemployed have been so for more than 
26 weeks, a greater percentage than at 
any point in the past eight years. 

The premise of the unemployment insurance 
system is that you give people 
some short-term support, the labor 
market picks up, and they can go back 
and find a job. Today, they cannot find 
jobs. In fact, not only can they not find 
them, more people are losing their 
jobs. So the labor market is contracting, 
not expanding. Extending 
benefits in this situation is the proper 
economic policy. Fed Chairman Greenspan, 
before the Joint Economic Committee 
this past November stated: ‘‘I 
have always argued that in periods like 
that the economic restraints on the unemployment 
insurance system almost 
surely ought to the eased.’’ 

This easing ought to include extending 
benefits to those who have already 
exhausted all of their benefits. I can 
not understand why anyone is objecting 
to extending benefits to these individuals. 
It is not because we lack the 
resources to extend benefits. Extending 
benefits to these individuals is projected 
to cost around $7.5 billion. Our 
unemployment insurance trust funds, 
specifically designed to meet this kind 
of situation, are in strong financial 
condition with approximately $24 billion. 
Those moneys have been paid into 
the trust fund over a period of time. 
The whole system was structured to 
have these trust funds build up in good 
times, and then to utilize them in bad 
times. 

We will spend much time debating 
the wisdom of various economic stimulus 
plans over the coming months, but 
one thing that everyone should be able 
to agree on is the stimulative effects of 
extending unemployment insurance 
benefits. As the Baltimore Sun wrote 
in an editorial on January 3, 2003, ‘‘Few 
dispute the clear returns from direct


ing short-term relief to those who lose 
their jobs as a result of the fiscal turbulence. 
Giving money to people who 
need it to pay their bills ensures that 
it will be spent and multiply as it ripples 
through the economy.’’ 

In closing, I would like to thank all 
of those who have worked so hard to 
pass the measure that we passed today. 
As a result many Americans will receive 
the benefits that they deserve 
and our economy will receive some of 
the stimulus that it needs. And I will 
continue to work to extend benefits to 
the 1 million Americans who have exhausted 
their unemployment insurance 
coverage. 

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise 
in support of the Emergency Unemployment 
Compensation Act. On December 
28, 2002, the Federal Government 
played Scrooge to nearly 800,000 
Americans. We left town, and we left a 
lot of people holding no money for the 
new year. Because the House of Representatives 
failed to pass an extension 
of unemployment benefits, 780,000 unemployed 
Americans—including 10,000 
unemployed Marylanders—had their 
benefits abruptly cut off just a few 
days after Christmas. 

Yet the story gets even worse. One 
million Americans have already exhausted 
both Federal and state aid 
without finding a new job, and 2 million 
are expected to run out of state 
benefits in the next five months. We 
must act now to help these working 
Americans who have been hardest hit 
by the economic downturn. 

That is why I am proud to cosponsor 
the Emergency Unemployment Compensation 
Act. This bill will give immediate 
assistance to those who need 
it most and it will put money back into 
the economy to keep it going. The 
Emergency Unemployment Compensation 
Act will help nearly 2.85 million 
Americans who are facing the highest 
unemployment rate since the recession 
during the first Bush Administration. 
It will restore benefits for those who 
were unfairly cut off in December and 
it will help those who will lose their 
benefits in the next five months. It will 
provide relief for approximately 30,000 
people in my own state of Maryland 
who still have not been able to find a 
job. 

Extending UI not only helps those 
who are hardest hit by bad economic 
times, it also helps turn the economy 
around. A good economic stimulus puts 
money in the hands of the people who 
will spend it. That is precisely what 
the Emergency Unemployment Compensation 
Act does. Workers who have 
lost their jobs because of September 
11th or the economic downturn will 
spend this money. They will spend it 
on necessities, like rent and food, to 
keep the economy going. This bill will 
inject $7.25 billion into the economy as 
an immediate stimulus. I believe this 
will do more to help the people and 
stimulate the economy than the across 
the board tax cuts for the wealthy. 


S12 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

I am so pleased that the Senate is 
ready to pass this bill. But this measure 
doesn’t go far enough. As long term 
unemployment balloons due to the 
weak economy, we can’t forget about 
the 1 million Americans who have already 
exhausted both Federal and state 
unemployment benefits and have still 
not found a job. These people have no 
income, and now they have no safety 
net. I urge my colleagues to provide an 
additional 13 weeks of extended unemployment 
benefits for these Americans. 

Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I 
rise today to urge the Senate to pass 
the extension of the Temporary Extended 
Unemployment Compensation, 
TEUC, Program. 

In November, the Senate acted 
unanimously to extend the TEUC program 
through the end of March by 
passing a bill that I cosponsored along 
with Senators CLINTON, CANTWELL, 
SPECTER, SARBANES, KENNEDY, and 
DURBIN. However, the House and Senate 
were unable to reach a compromise 
that would have allowed President 
Bush to sign the extension into law. 
This is our last chance to act before 
there is an interruption in the receipt 
of benefits pursuant to the TEUC program. 


November 2002, the nationwide unemployment 
level shot up to 6.0 percent 
from 5.7 percent in October. The law 
authorizing the TEUC program expired 
on December 28, 2002. If we do not act 
now to extend this program, as many 
as 800,000 workers who are receiving 
temporary benefits will not receive 
their full 13 weeks of extended unemployment 
benefits. 1.6 million workers 
will exhaust their regular unemployment 
benefits between December 28, 
2002 and the end of May 2003 if we fail 
to act. If we act today to extend this 
important program, we will ensure 
that these workers will receive their 
next unemployment check. 

The unemployment situation in my 
home State of Illinois is critical. It 
would be particularly adversely affected 
if we do not act. In November 
2002, Illinois had a 6.7-percent unemployment 
rate, tying Mississippi with 
the third highest unemployment rate 
in the country behind Alaska and Oregon. 
Illinois’ rate was substantially 
higher than the nationwide 6.0-percent 
unemployment rate. Over the 3-month 
period from September through November 
2002, the average unemployment 
rate in Illinois was 6.6 percent, 
which is significantly higher than the 
national average of 5.8 percent over the 
same period. In November, there were 
416,200 unemployed persons in Illinois. 

I have introduced legislation that 
would extend the provisions of the 
Temporary Extended Unemployment 
Compensation Act of 2002 to allow individuals 
receiving benefits to continue 
collecting them until they expire in 
full. This bill is retroactive, and permits 
people who otherwise would have 
had their TEUC benefits cut off on December 
28 to receive the full 13 weeks 
of TEUC benefits. Furthermore, this 

legislation would make individuals 
who have exhausted their regular 26 
weeks of unemployment insurance eligible 
for a 13-week extension, and 
would allow these individuals to apply 
for such extensions through the end of 
May. Under my bill, even those who enrolled 
in the TEUC program just prior 
to the expiration of the program would 
be eligible to receive full 13 weeks of 
extended unemployment benefits. 

This bill is a more generous extension 
of the TEUC program than the extension 
that the Senate approved last 
November. It provides for 5-month extension 
of the temporary unemployment 
insurance program, which is 
more than the 3 months of benefits provided 
by the extension that the Senate 
passed last year. Passing this legislation 
will help millions of families nationwide, 
easing the burden that these 
families might otherwise experience if 
their unemployment insurance were to 
have expired on December 28, 2002. It 
will help unemployed Americans feed 
their families and pay their bills while 
giving them an additional 5 months to 
find new jobs. 

I would like to thank the Senators on 
both sides of the aisle who have helped 
to negotiate this bipartisan compromise 
bill that will extend unemployment 
insurance benefits to the 
millions of Americans who need them. 

President Bush has called upon us to 
quickly pass legislation that will extend 
the TEUC program, a program 
whose benefits fell off a cliff on December 
28, 2002. I urge may colleagues in 
the Senate to support this necessary 
legislation. I also urge the House of 
Representatives to take up and pass 
this bill in an expeditious manner so 
that President Bush can sign the measure 
into law by this Thursday and prevent 
any interruption in the receipt of 
temporary unemployment insurance 

benefits. 
Several Senators addressed the 
Chair. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Democratic leader. 

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I fully 
appreciate the suggestion made by the 
distinguished Republican leader, the 
majority leader. Clearly, we have to resolve 
what we can resolve. I know a 
good deal of effort has been put forth in 
getting us to this point. But that does 
not acknowledge the urgency with 
which we have to address all of those 
people who are not considered in this 
resolution. 

The Senator mentioned the fact that 
our Republican colleagues in the House 
have chosen to recess tomorrow. You 
do not have the luxury of recessing if 
you are unemployed. You do not have 
the luxury of recessing if there is no 
other option for you but to seek unemployment 
compensation. 

I hope, as Senator REID has suggested, 
that we continue to find a way 
this afternoon to address this second 
group of people who need help, this 
750,000 to 1 million people who are not 
covered in this resolution. I think he is 

right. I don’t think we ought to leave 
until we get the job done this afternoon. 
There is no reason why we can’t 
complete our work on both groups 
today, and I urge my colleagues to stay 
until we get the job done. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Oklahoma. 

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield 
to my friend and colleague. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Montana. 

Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to my friend 
from Oklahoma. 

Go ahead. 

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we 
have to talk about what is doable. If 
people want to revisit what we did last 
year, I am happy to do that. We passed 
temporary Federal unemployment 
compensation extension last March or 
April. We passed that. It was a benefit. 
It passed overwhelmingly in the Congress. 
It expired on December 28. Several 
people said we need to extend that. 
Last year some people wanted to double 
the program from a 13-week Federal 
program to 26 weeks. This Senator, 
along with others, objected to 
that. The cost of that program or expansion 
was about $17- or $18 billion. I 
objected to it several times. I will object 
to it today. 

What I did agree to and what this 
Senate passed last year was a simple 
extension of present law. We agreed, 
Senator CLINTON and myself, Senator 
FITZGERALD, Senator SPECTER, Senator 
CANTWELL—by unanimous vote, the 
Senate agreed to a 3-month extension 
of the present program. That passed 
the Senate. It did not pass the House. 
The cost of that program was about 
$4.9 billion. The House had passed a 
program that cost a little less than $1 
billion. I tried to work out the differences 
between the House and the 
Senate late in the legislative session. I 
was not successful. Some of us have 
been working, frankly, for some period 
of time trying to get something done 
now. 

We have a letter from the Secretary 
of Labor, Elaine Chao. I ask unanimous 
consent to print this letter in the 
RECORD. 

SECRETARY OF LABOR, 

Washington, DC, January 6, 2002. 

Hon. BILL FRIST, 

Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Capitol Building, Washington, DC. 

DEAR SENATOR FRIST: Although the economy 
is showing some positive signs, we believe 
that a short extension of Temporary 
Extended Unemployment Compensation 
(TEUC) benefits is needed to give many unemployed 
workers continued access to the 
necessities of life while they look for new 
jobs. As the 108th Congress convenes, we urge 
you to quickly pass an extension of the 
TEUC program retroactive to December 28, 
2002. The only way for states to continue 
paying TEUC benefits without disruption is 
if a bill is presented to the President for signature 
no later than Thursday, January 9, 
2003. 

If you have any questions, please do not 
hesitate to have a member of your staff contact 
Mr. Anthony Bedell, Senior Legislative 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S13 

Officer, Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental 
Affairs, who will coordinate a departmental 
response. Mr. Bedell can be 
reached at (202) 693–4600. 

Sincerely, 

ELAINE L. CHAO. 

Mr. NICKLES. The essence of the letter 
says the only way for States to continue 
paying temporary unemployment 
compensation benefits without disruption 
is if a bill is presented to the 
President for signature no later than 
Thursday, January 9, the day after tomorrow. 


We had to resolve the differences between 
the House and the Senate. The 
Senate passed a $4.9 billion bill; the 
House passed a $1 billion bill. We have 
worked with our colleagues in the 
House. I think we have been successful. 
I believe we have been successful in 
getting them to accept a straight extension 
of present law. 

We were originally talking 3 months. 
After negotiations with the House, I 
consulted with my colleague and friend 
from New York and said, let’s make it 
a 5-month extension. So we extended 
the program all the way through May, 
and then the phaseout would occur. So 
there would not be a shutoff date as 
there was December 28, a much better 
transition. It was my understanding 
that colleagues had agreed upon this 5month 
extension. The cost of this proposal 
is estimated to be $7.2, $7.3 billion 
on a 2002 scoring base. It might go up if 
benefits go up on the calendar year. It 
might even be a little bit more than 
that. 

That is a significant change that I 
believe we have the House concurring 
with to pass. We will not pass and they 
will not concur with a doubling of the 
program to 26 weeks. I will not agree 
with it, and I don’t believe my House 
colleagues will, either. 

If we are going to provide unemployment 
compensation extension benefits 
so it would be a seamless transition, so 
those people who are presently receiving 
Federal temporary unemployment 
compensation, if they are in this 13week 
window, one week or 10, that they 
could continue to receive benefits 
without missing a week, we need to 
pass it. We need to pass it today. It 
needs to go to the House, and it needs 
to go to the President by Thursday for 
his signature. The only way that will 
happen will be by unanimous consent. 

I believe the only bill that will pass 
will be basically a clean extension of 
present law, and I believe the proposal 
we have before us is deserving of all of 
our support, just as the bill we passed 
last November, maybe October, we 
passed by unanimous consent a 3month 
extension, this is a unanimous 
consent extension for 5 months with a 
phaseout. 

I urge my colleagues not to object to 
the majority leader’s unanimous consent 
request. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Democratic leader. 

Mr. DASCHLE. Let me just see if we 
can resolve this issue. We have two 

questions. One is the substantive question 
about who ought to be included in 
the unemployment compensation package. 
We believe all of those who ought 
to benefit ought to be provided the coverage 
in this resolution. Our Republican 
colleagues say that half of those 
ought to benefit. The other question is 
whether we ought to be able to have a 
procedural vote, whether we ought to 
have an opportunity to vote on the 
amendment offered by the distinguished 
Senator from New York. 

I again ask consent that we have the 
one vote on the amendment offered by 
the Senator from New York and then 
obviously whatever the Senate may decide 
on that amendment would give us 
an opportunity to come to closure on 
the resolution itself. 

I see no reason why the Senate 
should be denied that opportunity on 
an issue this important on the very 
first day of the session. I ask unanimous 
consent that that amendment be 
allowed a vote at this time. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Pennsylvania. 

Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I respond 
to the comments by the Senator 
from South Dakota by saying the Senator 
from Oklahoma laid out clearly 
why a vote and adoption of such an 
amendment would be devastating. It 
would be devastating for the million 
people we want to cover with the unanimous 
consent request we have proposed. 
The House will not accept it. I 
am not too sure, even if we did pass it 
here and send it over to the House, the 
House would not accept it. We will be 
in conference and the opportunity for 
us to pass an unemployment extension 
by Thursday will be lost. I think it is 
important for us to pass a bill which, I 
remind everybody in the Chamber, 
passed when the Senator from South 
Dakota was the majority leader and 
the Senator from Montana was the 
head of the Finance Committee. They 
passed this unemployment extension. 

All we are saying is, let’s continue 
the unemployment extension that you 
proposed and you passed in the last session 
of Congress. All of a sudden your 
handiwork is no longer sufficient 
today. I don’t know what happened between 
what you did then and what we 
did today. I don’t know what possibly 
changed the dynamic that would now 
cause what we are proposing to be insufficient, 
when what you did was sufficient. 


The fact is, this is exactly what you 
passed under your leadership and what 
we should do today. We should stop 
playing politics out of the box with 
this very important issue to over 1 million 
people in this country and get the 
job done. 

Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield 
for a question? 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Democratic leader. 

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the 
Senator from Pennsylvania has made a 
number of errors in his comment. Let 
me clarify. We passed the resolution 

that we passed in the last session of 
Congress over the objections of many 
of those on our side, all of those on our 
side who felt this very amendment 
should have been included then. We 
were told back then we would revisit 
this issue immediately upon coming 
back. 

Well, we are doing that. But we had a 
clear understanding that there would 
be an occasion for us to have a debate 
and have the amendment we have suggested 
by the Senator from New York. 
That is No. 1. 

No. 2, I hope this body will never be 
dictated to by the House of Representatives. 
We are the Senate of the United 
States. As the Senate of the United 
States, I don’t want the House telling 
us what to do. We ought to do what is 
right. We ought to be the ones to dictate 
what our position is, not the 
House. 

I would hope we could accommodate 
the need to address this resolution and 
the need to address the resolution offered 
by the Senator from New York. I 
will suggest a new approach. I would 
ask unanimous consent that we send 
two resolutions to the House, the resolution 
before us and the resolution offered 
by the Senator from New York. I 
make that request at this time. 

Mr. NICKLES. I object. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection 
is heard. The Senator from Montana. 


Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is 
the present business? Is the request by 
the Senator from Tennessee the pending 
business? 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
original unanimous consent request of 
the majority leader is before the body. 

Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I have a couple 
of points. One, the Senator from Pennsylvania 
says, ‘‘what’s changed?’’ A lot 
has changed. The unemployment rate 
is higher than it was last March. That 
is a significant change. Second, the nature 
of unemployment in America regrettably 
is becoming more long term. 
Economists debate why that is happening; 
nevertheless, it is a fact. It is 
becoming more long term. Some of it is 
Rust Belt jobs not being replaced. A lot 
of it is in the service industries, whether 
in technology and financial; but it is 
becoming more long term. 

These people are having a hard time 
with the change in the nature of our 
economy and finding jobs. I think, 
frankly, the request by the Senator 
from New York is more than reasonable, 
that at least we should have an 
opportunity to vote on that; or we can 
take up the suggestion by the Senator 
from South Dakota, that we have two 
different options. 

I might also add that this is stimulative. 
The Senator from Washington 
pointed out, quite correctly, that 
economists say for every dollar spent 
on unemployment, $2.15 is recirculated 
into the economy. Essentially, a lot of 
the discussion at the beginning of this 
year is stimulus—how are we going to 


S14 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

stimulate the economy? I think that at 
least helping people who don’t have 
jobs gain a little bit of benefits is a 
good idea because it stimulates the 
economy. I further add that there will 
be a lot of discussion over the next 
weeks and months about the President’s 
stimulus plan, which includes 
tremendous tax breaks, whether it is 
dividends or income-tax breaks for 
these people who have jobs and income. 

What about the people who don’t 
have jobs, the people who don’t have 
income? If we are going to ‘‘stimulate’’ 
the economy by giving tax breaks, the 
very least we can do is help people who 
are unemployed in an economy whose 
very nature means there is longer unemployment. 


People who do not have income don’t 
pay income tax. I suggest that we find 
a way to have a vote on the amendment 
of the Senator from New York. 
Senators can vote against it. If Senators 
do not want to be ‘‘dictated’’ to 
by the House, they can vote their conscience 
and do what they think is 
right. If Senators believe the House 
trumps this body, they can vote 
against the amendment. They have 
that option. But at the very least, I believe 
that we, as responsible Senators— 
I heard a couple of great speeches not 
long ago about defending the Constitution 
of the United States and doing 
what is right. Clearly, doing what is 
right is helping people who need some 
help. That is what is right. That is why 
we are here. 

I understand it is a little inconvenient, 
and I don’t denigrate that because 
of the receptions and the parties that 
are going on here. I don’t think the 
Constitution had that in mind when 
the Framers wrote the provisions in 
that document, the oath of office which 
we took to support and defend our 
country. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from West Virginia is recognized. 

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope the 
leaders will provide some time for debate. 
The majority leader has made a 
unanimous consent request. Senators 
are reserving the right to object. They 
have no right to yield to other Senators 
when they are reserving the right 
to object. Let’s have an orderly procedure 
here. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
is correct. 

Mr. SCHUMER. I will reserve the 
right to object. 

Several Senators addressed the 
Chair. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Kansas is recognized. 

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I 
reserve the right to object, and I will 
not object. I think there is a lot of 
good debate points being raised. But I 
hope we don’t start this session the 
way we ended much of last year, which 
was getting in great debates about big 
topics and at the end of the day not 
passing anything. I think that is really 
where we ended, and we fouled up on a 
lot of bills last year—big bills. There 

were significant bills that we would 
work for weeks and months on and we 
didn’t get them done. 

We have a chance to do something 
here. I think everybody is agreed that 
there is more that could be done. That 
would be good, but we don’t have that 
agreement. We can start this session 
off with doing something or nothing. I 
hope at some point in time we can get 
to the point of doing something. 

We have a reasonable proposal that is 
agreed to by the basic principles in this 
proposal at least. Let’s pass that. Let’s 
start this session off with getting 
something that is going to be helpful 
for people. It may not be perfect for everybody, 
and that is obvious, but we 
can get something done here. It will be 
significant and it will be important and 
helpful. I hope we can move that forward 
and get this cleared through. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority 
leader is recognized. 

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in my 
unanimous consent request, I wanted 
to close what has become some debate 
here and basically say that we have an 
opportunity—and I believe an obligation—
to finish up the business that we 
didn’t finish in the last Congress, on 
which we have an opportunity to take 
the next very important step, which 
will affect the lives of 750,000 people 
after next Thursday, which doesn’t 
have anything to do with the House or 
the Senate. Thursday is the deadline 
for these checks. If they don’t go out, 
it affects 750,000 people. The 5 months’ 
extension that is being proposed here 
also affects the lives of about 21/2 million 
other people who will be enrolling 
over that period. Because we worked so 
hard on both sides of the aisle over so 
many months and weeks—and over the 
last several days—I didn’t recognize 
that we would get to a point now where 
we would have so many reservations of 
the right to object. We are talking 
about Thursday, checks not going out, 
a dislocation affecting 750,000 people, 
an additional 21/2 million, if we don’t 
address this today. With that, I will 
call for the regular order. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular 
order has been called for. Is there 
objection? 

Mr. DURBIN. I object. 

Mr. BYRD. What is the regular order? 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular 
order is a unanimous consent request 
made by the majority leader. The 
Senator can object. 

Mr. BYRD. Parliamentary inquiry: Is 
the resolution before the Senate? 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request 
is to have the measure sent to 
the desk and passed. 

Mr. BYRD. Then the resolution is not 
before the Senate. There is nothing before 
the Senate that can be amended at 
this point. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
is correct. A request has been 
made that it be granted so it can be 
brought for a vote. 

Mr. BYRD. The request is an all-encompassing 
request. It doesn’t give the 

Senate a chance to amend the resolution? 
That is what I am trying to find 
out. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from West Virginia is correct. 

The majority leader has asked for 
regular order. Senators may not reserve 
the right to object when the regular 
order has been called for. They either 
must object or permit the request 
to be granted. Is there objection? 

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I 
make a further unanimous consent request? 


Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, do I have 
the floor? 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority 
leader has the floor. 

Mr. BYRD. He made a request, but he 
sent something to the desk, didn’t he? 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority 
leader has made a unanimous 
consent request and he retains the 
floor. 

Mr. BYRD. Yes, he does. I understand 
that. I had hoped to suggest the absence 
of a quorum, but he does retain 
the floor. I ask unanimous consent 
that I may speak for 1 minute. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 

Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to 
object, I ask to speak for a minute following 
the Senator—— 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Chair believes that objection is heard. 
Is there objection to the majority leader’s 
request? 

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I object. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection 
is heard. The majority leader has 
the floor. 

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am obviously 
disappointed with this objection 
for the reasons that I have set out. 
There are 750,000 people and their dependents 
who depend on these distributions, 
as well as another 21/2 million 
people. We had been told this had been 
cleared on both sides after a lot of hard 
work. I am obviously disappointed, because 
this is the first move out for me, 
after it had been cleared on both sides, 
but I guess that is what I can come to 
expect. I do hope that my colleagues 
will rethink today’s objection and 
allow us, for the reasons I have said, to 
have this cleared later today. 

Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair. 

Mr. FRIST. I suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. FRIST. I renew my original request. 


The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 

Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to 
object—and I will not object the objection 
I raised earlier within the caucus 
has been discussed at length and it is 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S15 

clear to me that the Democratic leadership, 
Senator DASCHLE through the 
membership, will continue to fight for 
the million people who are not covered 
by this resolution, but we cannot turn 
our backs on the 2.8 million who need 
this check on Thursday. 

I will not object to this unanimous 
consent request. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

The bill (S. 23) was read the third 
time and passed.

EXTENSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 

Mr. FRIST. I ask the period of morning 
business be extended for 3 hours 
under the earlier parameters. 

Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent 
the 3 hours be divided equally.

Without objection, it is so ordered.

UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE 
Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me 
thank the distinguished Senator from 
Illinois for not objecting to this resolution. 
He and my colleagues feel very 
strongly, as is evidenced by the debate 
this afternoon. We will not give up, we 
will not relent, we will not allow those 
million Americans who have no coverage 
not getting the consideration 
they deserve in the Senate. We will 
continue to offer amendments. 
I put my colleagues on notice: On 
this legislation and on any other occasion 
that we have the opportunity to 
avail ourselves of an amendment, we 
will do so, because this deserves a vote. 
It deserves debate. It deserves passage. 
It is shameful we are leaving out these 
million people today. There is absolutely 
no excuse, especially when the 
President of the United States today is 
in Chicago talking about more tax cuts 
for those at the very top. That is 
wrong. 
It is an illustration of the extraordinary 
difference in philosophy about 
how we stimulate the economy. This is 
not only good for the economy, it is 
good for 1 million people left out as a 
result of the actions today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Nevada. 
Mr. REID. On the Democratic side we 
have a number of Senators who have 
asked for a specific time. I ask unanimous 
consent on our side, and on an alternating 
basis if, in fact, there are Republicans 
who wish to speak, that Senator 
BOXER first be recognized for 5 
minutes, Senator SCHUMER for 5 minutes, 
Senator STABENOW for 5 minutes, 
Senator DORGAN for 5 minutes, Senator 
REID of Rhode Island for 5 minutes, 
Senator MURRAY for 5 minutes. That is 
a total, I believe, of 35 minutes, leaving 
55 minutes for other Senators on this 
side of the aisle who wish to speak. The 
normal procedure is to alternate back 

and forth on the time evenly divided 
between now and 5 p.m. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 

objection, it is so ordered. 

The Senator from California. 

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank 
my assistant Democratic leader for the 
time. 

During the brief debate we had before 
we voted to extend these unemployment 
benefits, the Senator from Pennsylvania 
asked, What is wrong with 
you people? What has changed, that 
you really want to protect now these 1 
million people, when several months 
ago you did not speak as loudly for 
their inclusion? 

I state for the record what has happened 
in this period of time. As we go 
out and about our States, as I think we 
all did during this break, we find high 
anxiety among the people—high anxiety 
because of this economy. We are 
seeing more foreclosures than ever. 
Two million jobs have been lost in the 
private sector. On top of that we are 
seeing budget deficits that we have not 
seen in many years. 

My friend who is now presiding, my 
esteemed colleague, understands this 
anxiety. We have teamed up to work on 
giving a jump-start to the high-tech 
sector with a bill on wireless fidelity, 
which I believe is going to really help 
this economy. He understands that. 

We have a sense of urgency about 
that bill because we know we can turn 
things around. In my State we have a 
horrible situation in the northern 
areas because of what I would call a depression, 
really, in the high-tech sector. 
Some of it was to be expected; we 
went through this huge period of 
growth. We have some settling down 
there. But nonetheless, it is a problem. 
We have thousands of people in northern 
California who are suffering 
through no fault of their own. These 
people, who are intelligent, educated, 
and excellent workers, are out on the 
street. They are running out of benefits, 
and some of them have run out already. 
That is why we on this side of 
the aisle believe those million people 
should not be left out of the equation. 

I have a State of 35 million people. In 
terms of its economy, it would be the 
sixth largest economy in the world. 
The fact is, the good people in that 
State need help. Why we on this side of 
the aisle were so upset and why we 
kept objecting or reserving the right to 
object is we wanted to make sure the 
people’s voices were heard. That is 
what the Senate ought to be, a place 
where the voice of the people is heard. 

We have a situation where our States 
are worse off. They cannot come in and 
help because they are financially 
strapped because of the recession. So 
people are turning to us. Today we 
took care of some people. I am very 
proud we did that, but we have left out 
in the cold a million people. I will not 
be satisfied, speaking as one Senator, 
until we have taken care of all those 
who are in need. 

The Senator from Pennsylvania also 
made a comment that just some of the 

States have problems. This is not true. 
These million people reside in all of the 
States. In my own State, the pockets 
of real trouble are in the north of the 
State right now; the south of the State 
is doing better. But individuals all over 
this country need help. 

In summary, I say the Democrats are 
back. We are ready to go to work. We 
will stay. We will stay late into the 
night. But we are going to offer, all 
through this day and all through the 
coming days, a unanimous consent request 
saying we need to take care of 
those million people, those long-term 
unemployed people whose checks have 
already run out, who do not know 
where they are going to get the money 
to pay the rent, who don’t know if they 
will get evicted, who don’t know if 
they can take care of their children. 

There is a new term of art that has 
come about. It is called ‘‘food insecurity.’’ 
Food insecurity—that is a delicate 
way of saying people are hungry. 

We are seeing food insecurity. We are 
seeing housing insecurity. We are seeing 
joblessness. Can we turn it around? 
Of course we could turn it around. 

I have seen the President’s plan. In 
my personal opinion, having looked at 
where the benefits go, it is a bonanza 
to the wealthiest in the country, and it 
is a bust for the middle class. It is a 
budget deficit disaster. But he has a 
plan out there. It is a huge plan, and 
we are going to work to make it better, 
to get the benefits to those who need 
them. But if you want to talk about 
stimulus, talk about the million people 
who have no money to put bread on the 
table. 

In closing, let’s help those million 
people. I intend to stay here all this 
week and next and into future weeks to 
make sure we do. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
CHAFEE). The Senator from Wyoming. 

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have 
been here throughout this debate. I 
have not been involved in this issue 
prior to this point, as many have. But 
it has been an interesting and rather 
surprising sequence of events here on 
this first day, this sort of ceremonial 
day, in which we get into this kind of 
head-to-head arrangement. It is surprising. 


I do understand why this issue was 
brought to the floor. That is because 
there is a time element. We heard a 
letter from the Secretary of Labor indicating 
that in order to get a continuation 
of the unemployment benefits of 
those who are still eligible, we have to 
do it by Thursday. So I think that is a 
pretty compelling issue. In order to get 
that done, we obviously also have to do 
something that has been agreed to, apparently, 
by the House as well. 

So it is surprising to me that we have 
this effort made within the Senate, and 
also with House leadership, to try to do 
something within this time that is imperative 
we do, yet we come to the 
floor and apparently the very people 
who helped make the agreement now 


S16 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

are proposing an amendment which 
would kill the bill. Certainly it would 
not make it available in the time that 
is necessary. 

There is no reason for anybody to 
argue with the fact that there are 
those out there who need some additional 
help. This bill is not a total remedy. 
I think everyone admits that. We 
have to come back and do some other 
things. But this was argued last year. 
We could not get it done. We should 
have gotten it done last year and 
didn’t. Now we have an opportunity to 
do something today to get it to the 
President, to get it through the House 
before they adjourn—apparently today. 

It really sounds as if the process is 
such that it is pretty compelling that 
we do what seems to be available, and 
that is to pass a bill which would extend 
unemployment benefits to, apparently, 
up to 2 million people whose benefits 
otherwise would expire at the end 
of this week. If there are others who 
are eligible who still need some help— 
and there obviously are—then we can 
do that. We can come back and do that. 
But to sacrifice what we can do today 
to argue about something that we do 
not agree on yet and can do tomorrow 
does not seem to make good sense. 

I hate to think it is a political issue, 
bringing up now the President’s economic 
package. It really is not a part 
of this debate. The President has said 
all along that he wants to have the unemployment 
relief extended. So it is a 
puzzle to me. I hope we can now move 
forward. We have passed the bill. I say 
that is the greatest thing we could 
have done today. Certainly we needed 
to do that. We can come back and take 
a look at these other issues and everyone 
can get their opportunity to express 
their political issues and, I think, 
seek to separate us from the other side. 
I hate to think that is the case, but it 
seems to be. And it is too bad. 

The notion that some of us do not 
want to do anything is not accurate. 
How we do it is what we are talking 
about. We have been through it before. 

I am glad we are able to move forward. 
I think we ought to get in our 
minds a way to work on the issues that 
remain to be worked on and do that in 
the appropriate time. But I am reluctant 
to think we want to continue to 
confront one another today and to talk 
about all the bad things we can think 
of. That is not quite what is involved 
with this first session of the Senate. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Michigan. 

Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, 
there is no question that today is a day 
for family, a day for congratulations. I 
congratulate all my colleagues who 
were just sworn in. I know it is a very 
exciting day. I remember being in this 
position 2 years ago. It is a very special 
day. 

But in addition to celebrating family 
in the Senate today, we are very concerned 
about those families who find 
themselves in the difficult position of 

having no income coming in because of 
unemployment, through no cause of 
their own. 

They want to work. But because of 
the changing economy, the structure of 
the economy, or because of a variety of 
other reasons, they have found themselves 
unemployed. Certainly in Michigan 
we find that the changing economic 
structure has occurred for many 
people. Many of us have been asking 
that we remember them. We asked during 
the holidays that we remember 
those whose unemployment benefits 
would be ending during the holidays 
and that we take action before we left 
last year. That did not happen. We are 
back today. 

I commend the new leadership for 
their willingness to come forward with 
this issue of unemployment compensation. 
However, what we have seen 
today is a willingness to only do half 
the job. How can we say to a million 
people, and to their families, on a day 
when we celebrate families, that they 
don’t count? We are told that the 
House of Representatives would not 
support solving this problem completely 
or addressing it completely— 
that they would only support addressing 
half of it. 

We have said let us support solving 
the problem. And we did in fact pass a 
resolution to move forward solving half 
the problem. 

But our leader, Senator DASCHLE, 
also proposed that we add a separate 
resolution to complete the job to help 
those 1 million individuals who also 
find themselves in a situation of needing 
to extend their unemployment benefits. 
Yet we were told no again. We 
have been told no so many times on 
this floor as it relates to helping unemployed 
workers. It is very regrettable 
that today, one more time, we were 
told no. I think, more specifically, families 
were told no. Those who have lost 
their jobs were told no. One million 
people were told no. 

We celebrate today people coming 
into new commissions, new jobs, and 
with great pride, as they should. We 
know the ability to work and to be able 
to provide an income and care for your 
family is one of the basics of our society 
and our economy. We know that 
there are Americans today who find 
themselves in a difficult situation of 
searching for work, of being unemployed, 
and asking that their Government 
support their families as they 
move forward to find new employment 
so that they can care for their families 
in the way they would like to provide 
for them. Unfortunately, I believe 
today a tone was set by choosing not to 
address this problem completely at a 
time when we are seeing, unfortunately, 
one more time, an economic 
plan rolled out to help those who have 
been helped so many times who are at 
the very top of the income bracket in 
our country. 

As a member of the Budget Committee, 
I have heard many economists, 
including Alan Greenspan, say that by 

extending unemployment benefits—and 
by putting dollars into people’s pockets 
so they can pay their bills, buy the 
shoes for their children, and be able to 
continue providing groceries for their 
families and paying other bills which 
they have—we actually stimulate the 
economy. We create demand. When 
there is money in people’s pockets, 
they are spending it. We know someone 
who is unemployed is going to be 
spending it because they have to. The 
money coming in is not being saved. It 
is being spent on clothes, food, the 
electric bills, the car payment, the 
mortgage payment, and so on. 

We know that is a short-term economic 
stimulus—certainly at a time 
when we are debating economic stimulus. 


What we have been asking for today 
is something that is not only fair and 
right to address—all of those who find 
themselves in a situation of being unemployed, 
not leave 1 million people 
out of the solution—but we are also 
asking, as we talk about economic 
stimulus, that we in fact provide the 
kind of stimulus that puts money back 
into the economy and helping those 
who need to spend it to care for their 
families, to pay their bills, to be able 
to remain independent in their homes, 
and to be able to know that they are a 
part of the economic equation, and 
when we talk economic stimulus, that 
they are not left out. 

While I am pleased we were able to 
pass the resolution, I am very disappointed 
that this very first time we 
were not able to address or even bring 
forward in a separate resolution the 
ability to address 1 million people 
today who are looking to us, at a time 
of celebration, and asking us to remember 
them; to ask on their behalf so 
they, too, can have the ability to care 
for their families. I hope we will, as 
quickly as possible, finish the job. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from Rhode Island. 

Mr. REED. Mr. President, I first ask 
unanimous consent that Senator SCHUMER 
be placed as the next Democrat to 
be recognized in the order of recognition. 


The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. 


Mr. President, let me remind not 
only my colleagues, but the American 
people, why we are forced today, at the 
eleventh hour, to make a very cruel 
choice between helping some Americans 
and abandoning other Americans. 
It is because all through last fall, the 
Republican House of Representatives 
refused to take up and vote upon unemployment 
benefits in a meaningful way 
that would lead to successful passage. 
The President did not involve himself 
on this issue until the unemployment 
rate reached 6 percent. He fired his economic 
team, and they discovered there 
really were Americans who desperately 
need help. 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S17 

Today we were forced to make those 
choices that you see sometimes in the 
movies about who gets to stay in the 
life boat. It was a completely unnecessary 
choice. 

The Senator from Oklahoma talked 
about one proposal costing $4 billion 
and another proposal costing $1 billion. 
The House wanted $1 billion. 

There is a surplus today in the unemployment 
insurance trust fund of $24 
billion. There is absolutely no fiscal 
reason we could not provide these benefits 
to 1 million Americans who have 
exhausted their unemployment benefits. 
We heard from colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle that they are 
categorically opposed to giving any extension 
of benefits beyond a certain 
time. This not only defies logic and defies 
the fiscal status of the trust fund 
but also defies history. 

In the early 1990s, this Government 
extended unemployment compensation 
a total of five times—three times under 
President George Herbert Walker Bush 
because unemployment continued to 
rise for the 15th month after the so-
called end of the recession. There are 
cases in which individuals were able to 
collect unemployment benefits for a 
total of 52 weeks because they qualified 
for these extensions. 

Why is this so important? Because 
people are desperate. They had good 
jobs. They lost those jobs. They are 
looking for comparable work. They 
cannot find it. The record of this economy 
under this President is dismal. 
Family incomes have fallen for the 
first time in 8 years. Poverty is increasing. 
Families at all income levels 
are losing their health insurance left 
and right. Gross domestic product is 
growing, but it is growing too feebly to 
generate the jobs these people need. 

Since the President took office, 2.2 
million private payroll jobs have been 
lost. We are losing jobs. We are not 
gaining jobs. We are asking them to 
find jobs; we are setting them on a task 
that is extraordinarily difficult. 

So what can we do in the interim? 

We can at least give them unemployment 
compensation, extended, if necessary. 
It is the fair thing to do. It is 
the wise thing to do. The President, in 
his economic speech in Chicago, talked 
about some special $3,000 benefit for 
those people who are unemployed. 
Let’s do the mathematics. That $3,000 
represents probably a fraction of the 
unemployment insurance someone 
would collect if we voted for these benefits. 
That is not a good deal for the 
people of America—a $3,000, one-time 
payment, some type of scheme in 
which they can use it either to pay 
their household costs or go to training 
versus receiving, on a regular basis, unemployment 
compensation as they 
look for work. 

The reality, as my colleague from 
Montana pointed out, is that unemployment 
is different today than it was 
even 10 years ago in the recession of 
the early 1990s. It is different because 
the economy has changed. 

The State which the Presiding Officer 
and I represent used to be a manufacturing 
center, not just to the United 
States but to the world. That is changing. 
As I go about our State talking to 
people, the unemployed are 50-year-old, 
former mid-level management people 
who used to work for a company. They 
did not get fired. They did not get laid 
off. The company went away, went out 
of business, moved its operations to 
Mexico, moved its operations to Singapore. 
And then you ask this person, 
with a mortgage, college tuitions—and 
the health care benefits which they 
used to get at work are now his responsibility 
or her responsibility—to go 
look for a job with comparable pay? 
They are not hiring people like that. 
They are looking for the 35-year-old, 
with a computer degree, who will work 
cheaper, who does not have those responsibilities 
of a family, of a mortgage. 


That is the reality out there. That is 
what we are fighting about today, not 
the number ‘‘1 million,’’ but a million 
Americans, struggling to find work, 
trying to find work. They need help. 
And we turn our back on them today. I 
heard my colleague, the Senator from 
Oklahoma, say he would never bring up 
extension of these benefits to people 
who have exhausted their benefits already. 
I heard the majority leader sort 
of talk about: Well, we want to deal 
with this issue, but let’s get this issue 
done first. 

The message is pretty clear to me 
and should be clear to the American 
public: We are walking away today 
from a million people. We should not 
do that. 

This seems to me to be so clear and 
so obvious that I am, in fact, amazed 
and shocked at what we did. The 
money is there. This is a benefit for 
people who are looking for work. Once 
they find work, the benefit expires. We 
are talking about stimulating the 
economy. What is more stimulating 
than giving people money to pay for 
their household goods as they look for 
work? 

I am more than disappointed. But we 
were forced today, because of the inattention 
of the administration and the 
House, at the last minute, to choose 
between denying benefits to all unemployed 
Americans or abandoning about 
a million—a cruel, unnecessary choice. 
We can do better. We should do better. 

I yield the floor.

yields time, time will be charged equally 
to both sides.

TRIBUTE TO SENATOR TRENT 
LOTT 

Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, this is 
the first day of the 108th Congress. I remember 
the former Senator from Kansas, 
Nancy Kassebaum, used to refer to 
these days as the first day of school, 
coming back after the recess. Of 
course, it is a time of celebration as 
new Senators gather. This one is particular 
in that it is a time of a new majority 
leader. I rise to express my confidence 
in and give my congratulations 
to Senator FRIST of Tennessee in his 
assuming the position as majority 
leader. He will prove to be an outstanding 
leader. The Senate and the 
people of the United States will be well 
served by his stewardship. 

However, I wish to take this opportunity 
to make a few comments about 
the previous majority leader, Senator 
LOTT of Mississippi. Senator LOTT has 
been very much in the news of the last 
few weeks. He ultimately made what I 
consider to be the right decision in 
stepping aside so that the challenges 
raised to him would not get in the way 
of the business of the Senate or of the 
country. The caricature of Senator 
LOTT that appeared in much of the national 
media did not match in any way 
the man that I know and love. 

I rise to comment briefly on the contribution 
Senator LOTT has made to 
this institution and to the Nation and 
take the opportunity of the shifting of 
power to pay tribute to Senator LOTT 
and the work he has done. 

There are many things in his career 
that we could point to. This is not his 
funeral so I won’t run through a list. 
But there is one in particular that 
stands out in my mind, which I will 
share with those who may be watching, 
that demonstrates the kind of leader 
TRENT LOTT WAS. I refer to the experience 
many of us described as the most 
significant of our careers, and that was 
the historic moment when the Senate 
sat in judgment as a trial for the impeachment 
of the President of the 
United States. For only the second 
time in our history, a President had 
been impeached by the House of Representatives, 
and we were required 


S18 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

under the Constitution to hold a trial 
to determine whether the President 
should be convicted of those crimes of 
which he was impeached. 

Many in the press, many uninformed, 
asked: Why is the Senate wasting its 
time dealing with this challenge? 

The Constitution left us with no 
choice. Once the House of Representatives 
had voted impeachment, the Senate 
was required under the Constitution 
to hold a trial, with the Chief Justice 
of the United States presiding. It 
was a historic time, and many of my 
colleagues commented that this was 
the most significant vote they would 
ever cast in their political careers. 

We met in the old Senate Chamber to 
discuss what we should do. That was a 
historic meeting, off the record, if you 
will, because it was not here with an 
official reporter taking down every 
word. But it was an opportunity for 
Senators to speak freely and openly. In 
very solemn and somber proceedings, 
we discussed what we should do. I am 
not violating any confidences because 
it has been reported in the press that 
the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. 
BYRD, spoke on behalf of the Democrats 
as we addressed that issue. He 
made this point. I can’t remember his 
exact words, but these were the words 
that are in my mind. 

Referring to the case before us, he 
said: This case is toxic. It has besmirched 
the Presidency, and it has 
soiled the House of Representatives. 
And it is about to do the same thing to 
us. 

I believe his analysis was correct, 
that the case of President Clinton and 
his actions did indeed besmirch the 
Presidency, degrade the Presidency, 
and I think the way it ultimately 
played out in the House of Representatives 
stained that body and left bitterness 
that is still producing bitter fruit. 
Senator BYRD warned this case, this 
toxic case, was about to affect the Senate. 


The majority leader, who had to handle 
such a case, was TRENT LOTT of 
Mississippi. I was at his side in many of 
his meetings. I watched from afar in 
many of the other things he did. Senator 
LOTT handled that historic challenge 
with as much sensitivity, finesse, 
wisdom and, yes, grace as it would be 
possible to do. 

When it was over, Senator LOTT and 
Senator DASCHLE met in the well of the 
Senate, embraced each other, and said: 
We did it. 

Yes, they did. And they did it together. 
But the primary responsibility 
was on the shoulders of Senator LOTT. 
He made Senator BYRD’s prophecy not 
come true. Instead of staining the Senate, 
instead of soiling the Senate the 
way that case soiled the Presidency 
and the House, it was in many ways the 
Senate’s finest hour. The case was handled 
with dignity. The case was handled 
with dispatch. And the case was 
handled with a minimum of bad feelings 
on both sides. 

There are some outside the Senate 
who attacked Senator LOTT and said: 

You should have had a full-blown trial. 
You should have let this drag on for 6 
weeks, even 6 months. And at the end 
of that period of time, maybe, just 
maybe, you would have had a conviction. 


Senator LOTT understood that the 
dignity of this body and the unity of 
the country required the kind of handling 
of that case that he gave us. 

History will look back on the stewardship 
of TRENT LOTT as majority 
leader of the United States with great 
approval and kindness. This is a man of 
extraordinary skills who handled himself 
in an extraordinary way, and all of 
us who sat in the Senate through that 
experience benefited by his leadership. 

Now he is moving on to other assignments. 
As I congratulate Senator 
FRIST on his ascension to the majority 
leadership, I also congratulate Senator 
LOTT on the prospect of a continued career 
of contribution, perhaps in the 
policy area more than in the process 
area. He has demonstrated that he can 
master the legislative process as well 
as anyone on the planet. I expect he 
will now demonstrate that he can 
make contributions of equal significance 
in the policy area. 

On a personal note, while he is many 
years my junior in this business of politics, 
he has acted as my mentor and 
my teacher. I can think of many times 
when I have been tangled up in the minutia 
and arcane nature of the way this 
body works, where I had nowhere else 
to go to get myself untangled and set 
straight. I called Senator LOTT and, 
with calmness and clarity, he said, why 
don’t we do this and, suddenly, the 
Gordian knot was cut and I emerged 
ready to go forward in my career because 
of his wisdom and his guidance. 

Again, I congratulate Senator FRIST. 
I was happy to vote for him when the 
opportunity came. I am looking forward 
to working with Senator FRIST as 
he demonstrates his ability to lead this 
body. I have every confidence that that 
will be a tremendous period in the Senate’s 
history, but, at the same time, I 
wanted to rise and make it clear that 
as we embrace Senator FRIST’s leadership 
we should recognize and pay tribute 
to the contribution made to this 
body and ultimately to the country by 
Senator TRENT LOTT of Mississippi. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from New York is recognized.

UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I 
congratulate all of my new colleagues 
who were sworn in today, and all of 
those who won reelection—but particularly 
those who are here for the first 
time, and my good friend from New 
Jersey who is here for the second time, 
with a hiatus. I congratulate the new 
leadership on the Republican side, 
along with Majority Leader FRIST. We 
look forward to working together for 
the good of our country. 
Today, I stand here feeling, I guess I 
would say, boxed in because we on this 

side of the aisle who feel that the unemployment 
package was not adequate 
are faced with the choice of taking half 
a loaf or none. Of course, when you are 
in a legislative body, you tend to take 
that half loaf. We will do it today—or 
we have done it already today. But 
when it comes to people out of work, 
when it comes to the pain in the eyes 
of fathers and mothers, young men and 
women who talk about missing or losing 
a job, knocking on doors and not 
being able to find one, half a loaf is not 
very adequate. 

I find it confounding that the other 
side did not allow the amendment my 
colleague from New York proffered. We 
only asked for a half hour of debate, so 
it cannot be that it would take up 
much time. We certainly do not believe 
that they didn’t want to help the unemployed. 
So the only logical answer is 
dollars. They thought it might be too 
expensive. To me—the main point I 
want to make this afternoon is this— 
the contrast of our President speaking 
in Chicago and putting forward a $600 
billion plan of relief, mostly on the tax 
side—and the vast majority of that 
plan goes to the very highest income 
levels. I read somewhere that 42 percent 
goes to 1 percent; 1 percent of the 
highest income get 42 percent of the relief. 
One percent is 311,000. So there is 
$600 billion to go to tax relief, mainly 
for the most well off, and there is not 
a billion dollars to include a million 
people—150,000 New Yorkers—to give 
them the unemployment benefits they 
now do not have. 

How many Americans would support 
that? Our job is to juxtapose those two 
issues. I hope the media will do that. 
These are not two separate issues because 
we have not heard a single reason 
that we cannot take the larger bill. 
They say our colleagues in the House 
will object. Then let the American people 
look at them and say to them, if 
you can afford and you are going to 
support $600 billion in tax relief, largely 
to extremely wealthy, high-income 
individuals and families, why can’t you 
support a billion dollars for the unemployed? 


If the election we just held were on 
that issue, what do you think would 
have happened? My guess is that the 
results would have been quite different. 
Frankly, our colleagues in the House 
and some on the other side of the aisle 
don’t like to see this issue contrasted. 
The tax relief—huge amounts of it—is 
going to the upper income spectrums 
and the stingiest, the parsimonious attitude 
when it comes to the unemployed. 
It is not that we cannot afford 
it, because I offer to my colleagues, 
let’s do $599 billion of tax relief and do 
this billion dollars. Hardly anyone 
would notice, except those million people 
who are out of work and desperately 
looking for work. 

So I hope we will have another opportunity 
to work this amendment forward. 
I worry that we can make a lot of 
speeches on the floor of the Senate, 
but, yes, they will say, bring it up as 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S19 

part of the stimulus package, we will 
pass it in the Senate. But it will die in 
conference, and then there is nothing 
we can do legislatively. 

So while I didn’t agree with my colleague 
from Illinois for objecting because 
we are in such a box—I thought 
we should not object and try to persuade 
them—I sympathize with his 
anger and with his frustration that we 
could not spend a half hour to talk 
about some money for people who are 
out of work, or our colleagues here 
would have withdrawn the bill and hurt 
the 2.8 million who will benefit, and 
justifiably so. 

The issue of money for the jobless 
doesn’t change America. Unfortunately, 
it is not the most important 
issue we face. Getting a good education 
and good health care and more jobs for 
people is far more important than a 
stopgap measure. Until we are able to 
do that—so far we have not—we have 
to help those who need help. These are 
not people sitting on their duffs trying 
to get a check. They are people who are 
knocking on doors every day. When a 
notice goes out that one company is 
hiring, you see hundreds and even 
thousands in my city and elsewhere 
throughout my State lined up around 
the block. 

People desperately want work. The 
best thing we can do is give them jobs 
by stimulating the economy in a real 
way. But until we do, it is our fundamental 
and solemn and important responsibility 
to at least let them live a 
life of dignity, maintain the payment 
on the home, feed the child, put a coat 
on the spouse’s back. That is all we 
were trying to do today. It is unfortunate 
that we were put in such a box 
and we were told take half a loaf or 
none. When it comes to unemployment, 
we should not have to deal with half a 
loaf. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from North Dakota is recognized. 

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I regret 
what happened in the Senate today. We 
passed some legislation that will offer 
some assistance to some who are unemployed 
in this country, but we left 1 
million people who should have received 
the help of Members of the Senate, 
from the Congress, and from the 
President, without the kind of help 
they need. A lot of folks in this country 
don’t have people clogging the hallways 
of the Capitol lobbying on their 
behalf—certainly not the people who 
are without means, at the lower end of 
the economic ladder; they have not 
hired people in the hallways of the Capitol 
to represent their interests. They 
rely on us to do that. There are so 
many families in this country who 
know things that Members of the Senate 
do not know. They know about a 
second shift, they know about a second 
job, they know about a second mortgage, 
and they know about buying a 
secondhand car. They know firsthand 
that they are the first in this country 
during an economic downturn to be 

called into an office and be told, by the 
way, you are being laid off, you are losing 
your job. 

Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds 
of thousands of Americans have had to 
go home to tell their families that, 
through no fault of theirs, they were 
given a notice that their job was gone. 
They are no longer employed. It is a 
devastating thing for families to experience 
that. In most cases, during an 
economic downturn, the Congress has 
moved very quickly to say, yes, you 
lost your job, but it wasn’t through 
your fault, it wasn’t something you 
did, and we want to help you, we want 
to extend a helping hand during this 
rough spell in the American economy. 
Congress has always done that—that is, 
until last year when we tried and tried 
in the Senate to pass legislation to extend 
that helping hand and extend unemployment 
benefits, and now again 
today when we made the effort once 
again. 

It is terribly disappointing that 
today the President is in Chicago announcing 
his tax proposal. At a time 
when we are experiencing very substantial 
budget deficits, the President is 
proposing a tax cut of $675 billion over 
the next 10 years. That is $65 billion, 
$70 billion a year for 10 years in tax 
cuts, and then we are told: But there is 
not enough money really to fund that 
rather small amount needed to help 
those who are unemployed, who have 
lost their jobs. I do not understand 
that. 

It is interesting to me, and also a little 
perplexing, that we are told the 
budget deficits are just a result of the 
economy; it is just because the economy 
turned sour. A year and three-
quarters ago, we had a debate in the 
Chamber of the Senate about a new fiscal 
policy. We were told we ought to 
embrace the idea of very large tax cuts 
for the long term. 

Some of us stood up at these desks 
and said: Wait a second, it is pretty 
hard to see very far down the road. 
Shouldn’t we worry perhaps some unforeseen 
consequences could run this 
economy into the ditch and cause very 
serious problems? Not to worry, they 
said. We have all that covered. We have 
contingency plans. So just pass this big 
tax cut of ours. The Congress did—not 
with my vote, but they did pass that 
large tax cut. 

Within months, we discovered our 
economy was in a recession. Months 
later, on September 11, we were attacked 
by terrorists. And then there 
were corporate scandals almost unprecedented 
in this country’s history. The 
tech bubble burst in the stock market. 
All of a sudden, very large Federal 
budget surpluses turned into very large 
Federal budget deficits, and now we are 
in a fix. Now we have competing needs, 
one of which is the item we discussed 
today: The need during an economic 
downturn to reach out a hand and help 
those who need help, to help those who 
have lost their job, by extending unemployment 
benefits. 

Another competing interest and need 
was announced today by President 
Bush, saying what we really need at a 
time of unprecedented budget deficits— 
as far as the eye can see—is more tax 
cuts, $675 billion in additional tax cuts. 

Interestingly enough, in terms of priorities, 
they say no to the people who 
have lost their jobs and need their unemployment 
extended, but they say yes 
in public policy, in this tax proposal, 
that we ought to tax people who work: 
Let’s tax work and let’s exempt investment. 
What kind of a value system is 
that? 

There are many ways of making 
money. Some of them are to go to 
work, work hard, and get a paycheck. 
No one is proposing eliminating the tax 
on the paycheck, are they? So they 
say: Let’s tax work. 

Another way to make money is to 
collect substantial dividends from 
stockholdings and stock purchases, and 
the President is saying: Let’s exempt 
that; we should not tax that at all. 

I do not understand the value system: 
Let’s tax work but exempt investment. 
Guess what that says. That says 
to the American people who are work-
ing—who, in my judgment, are the people 
who make this economic engine 
work well—we are going to tax you, 
but the folks who just sit back and collect 
their dividends—incidentally, the 
folks at the top of the income earning 
ladder—we are going to exempt you. 
Not with my vote we are not. Yet in 
terms of priorities on the very day the 
President says let’s have a $675 billion 
tax cut, let’s keep taxing work and exempt 
from taxation investment, he and 
our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle say: We cannot afford that small 
amount of money to extend unemployment 
benefits to those at the bottom of 
the economic ladder, those who have 
had to come home with shattered 
dreams to tell their family: I have lost 
my job. What a devastating situation 
that is. These are people who want to 
work, who did work and, through no 
fault of their own but through a bad 
economy, lost their ability to work. 

The best tradition in this country 
has always been for this Congress, during 
an economic downturn, for sound 
reasons, including trying to provide 
some stimulus to the economy, to say 
to those who have lost their jobs: We 
want to help you. It helps this country 
to help you. We are there now to give 
you some help during a tough time for 
you and your family. 

I regret very much that today we 
were not able to do that for 1 million 
Americans who look to Capitol Hill and 
this capital city for us to make the 
right decision at the right time. 

Today, regrettably, the majority in 
the Senate failed. There will be another 
day, and my hope is we will see 
a different decision, a better decision 
for those folks at the bottom of the 
economic ladder who want to work, 
who did work but lost their jobs, and 


S20 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

for whom no one is clogging the hallways 
of Congress lobbying on their behalf. 
If this were a big economic interest, 
you can bet this Capitol would be 
full of people, well paid, with dark 
suits, ready to make the case for their 
economic interest. 

There are a lot of folks out there 
today who are going to gather around 
their supper table and talk about their 
lot in life during an economic downturn 
and talk about where they looked 
for a job today, talk about the job they 
used to have, and talk about the hopes 
they had that we would help them during 
this tough period. They today will 
be mighty disappointed. 

My hope is in a week or in a month, 
perhaps we can persuade our colleagues 
that today’s decision was the wrong 
choice for our country and certainly 
the wrong choice for a lot of American 
families relying on the Congress to 
make the right decision today. 

Mr. President, I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator 
from New York. 

Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I associate 
myself with the remarks of the 
Senator from North Dakota who has, 
once again, eloquently put this issue 
into a much larger context, a context 
that concerns the economic and tax 
policies of our country. 

Today I have introduced a bill to help 
those who have exhausted their unemployment 
benefits, the nearly 1 million 
Americans we have heard spoken about 
from so many of my colleagues from 
Washington to North Dakota to Rhode 
Island, who have just run out of time 
and run out of money. They were eligible 
for the programs that each State 
administers, as it should be, because in 
many of our States we have had an increase 
in unemployment over the last 
year. 

We now have a 6 to 6.5-percent unemployment 
rate in many parts of the 
country. In New York City, which is 
still dealing with the aftermath of the 
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, 
we have an 8-percent unemployment 
rate. Many of these people who lost 
their jobs have been working all their 
lives. When something happened—a 
layoff, a bankruptcy, a terrorist attack—
and many of them have spent 
month after month looking for work 
and not finding it. In an economy such 
as we have now, which is not producing 
jobs, many people for the first time 
ever, especially given what we enjoyed 
during the 1990s, are finding it impossible, 
not just to find a job that paid 
what they were used to receiving 
through their job, but paying anything. 

I recently had a number of such New 
Yorkers to my office in New York City 
shortly before the December 28 cutoff 
of unemployment benefits. I wish they 
could be here in the Chamber. 

I wish that all of my colleagues could 
speak with the man who had worked on 
the Windows of the World restaurant at 
the top of the World Trade Center for 
more than 20 years, a manual laborer 
but a good hearted, decent American 

who, year after year, showed up, did 
what he was supposed to do, and luckily 
for him and his family was not at 
work on the morning of September 11, 
but unluckily for him and his four children, 
he no longer has any work. He 
has gone from place to place. 

I wish my colleagues could meet the 
woman from Queens who was widowed 
when her husband died 3 years ago, had 
worked in the same business for many 
years, and now has lost her job and no 
longer has unemployment benefits. 
What are we supposed to tell these people? 


We ended welfare as we knew it because 
we did not want anyone to be dependent, 
to produce generational dependency, 
and I supported that. There 
is not any better social program than a 
job. But when we do not produce jobs 
in the economy for decent, hard-working 
Americans, what do we expect to 
happen? 

Some of the things that are happening: 
In many States, after being in 
decline for years, welfare rolls are 
climbing. In many States, homelessness 
is increasing, and it is homelessness 
of families with children. Bankruptcies 
are growing. Individuals who 
are chronically unemployed are going 
on Social Security disability in order 
to have some kind of income, one of 
the fastest growing programs in our 
country. 

When we first started talking about 
extending unemployment benefits—I 
introduced a bill last July—we did not 
get to first base. We did not even get 
out of the dugout. We would raise it 
time and again. My wonderful friend, 
our late colleague, Senator Wellstone 
from Minnesota, used to be at that 
desk. He would never be in the chair 
but would be pacing about. Before his 
tragic accident, every day he came to 
the floor asking that we extend unemployment 
benefits. 

We often harkened back to the situation 
during the recession of the early 
1990s when unemployment benefits 
were extended five times and signed 
into law by the first President Bush, as 
well as President Clinton. Finally, the 
Senate passed a measure. 

I appreciated greatly working with 
my colleague, Senator NICKLES from 
Oklahoma, to get that done last year. 
We could not get it through the House. 
We did not have the support of the administration. 
But today, we have done 
the right thing, at least half the right 
thing. I am very grateful for that. I 
thank the President for his support. I 
thank the Republican leadership in the 
House for their support, but I mostly 
thank my colleagues and our new majority 
leader, Senator FRIST, for making 
sure this was the first order of business 
for this 108th Congress. 

What we did today to help the nearly 
800,000 Americans who watched their 
unemployment benefits disappear at 
the stroke of midnight on Saturday, 
December 28, to make sure the program 
will be there for those who are unfortunately 
coming on to the unemployment 

rolls was important, but it was not 
enough. We have to do more. We have 
to recognize the people who have exhausted 
their benefits, who are working 
as hard as they can to get work, 
who are found throughout our country, 
in every walk of life, doing every kind 
of job with every sort of challenge one 
could imagine. But what are we going 
to say to them? 

We have a big task ahead of us to try 
to get our economy growing again, create 
jobs, move our Nation in the right 
direction. This new problem in the 21st 
century—new in the wake of the economic 
boom of the 1990s, that we have 
tens of thousands of Americans who 
want to work but cannot find a job— 
will have to be addressed. 

Mr. President, I would now like to 
discuss a bill I am introducing. 

THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator from New York is recognized. 

Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Chair.

WESTERN DROUGHT 
Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in listening 
to my friend from New York talk 
about homeland security and the work 
we will be doing, she agreed to cochair 
the A 9/11 caucus. I invite other Members 
of this body to get interested. We 
found out cell phones worked pretty 
well during 9/11. Communications 
worked fairly good. There were some 
weak points, but those are being addressed. 
When we talk about 9/11 and 
wireless communications, there will be 
several of those issues that will come 
up in this Congress. We welcome the 
input of our colleagues as those issues 
move along. 
Today we did take care of part of the 
unemployment compensation problem, 
extending it to workers involuntarily 
and who became involuntarily unemployed 
during 9/11 or as a result of 9/11. 
There is not one in this body who was 
not sympathetic to their cause. However, 
I have another segment of the 
American economy that is hurting just 
as badly. I will talk a little, by the 
way, today about the situation called 
drought. It is expanding throughout 
not only the upper Midwest but 
through the western part of Kansas, 
Nebraska, Dakotas, Montana, and Colorado, 
and extending down into New 
Mexico and the panhandle of Oklahoma. 
There are always islands and spots 
that get enough moisture. In this 
morning’s newspaper, the Billings Gazette 
in my hometown of Billings, MT, 
it was reported the water contents in 
the lower Yellowstone Basin snow pack 
rank the third lowest on record. It is 
only 63 percent of average. That one 
year at 63 percent average does not 
give cause for alarm. However, when 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S21 

you look at the sixth year of these situations, 
you get alarmed. 

Last Friday, I drove to Sheridan, MT. 
I have never seen in the Big Horns, in 
the range west and northwest of Sheridan, 
WY, a snow pack that is as small 
as it is for this time of the year. The 
same is true in the Bear Tooth, but further 
west it is better. In the area important 
to irrigators and water users in 
my State, those snow packs are very 
low. 

Agriculture in those droughted areas 
is just hanging on. If not relief this 
year, then we do not have to worry 
about them next year. They will be unemployed, 
too, and for reasons beyond 
their control. It is beyond anyone’s 
control. Yet they do not qualify for unemployment 
benefits that we have approved 
today. A disaster package is 
being worked on. There are some folks 
averse to that. 

Many of my colleagues in the Senate 
and in the administration continue to 
cite the farm bill as a solution for 
drought-stricken American agriculture. 
This bill is not retroactive, 
folks. It does not account for the losses 
incurred in 2001 and 2002. I remember 
the debate on that farm bill. The 
amount of money going to the Department 
of Agriculture sounded huge, 
spending almost $74.4 billion a year 
with the USDA. But they ignored that 
27 percent of that figure was dedicated 
to farm programs and no money dedicated 
for disaster. Regarding the rest 
of the money, the American taxpayer 
should be overwhelmingly thanked for 
their generosity by those who perhaps 
cannot speak for themselves. That is, 
the working poor, women, infants and 
children, and food stamps. Mr. President, 
63 percent of that humongous figure 
that people thought would go to 
production agriculture does not even 
go near production agriculture. 

We thank the American taxpayer for 
making sure that, yes, there are food 
and nutrition programs dedicated to 
those seeing tough times in other sectors 
the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition 
Program, school lunches and 
breakfasts, food stamps, WIC, a program 
administered by the counties, to 
make sure young women, and usually 
young, single women, know something 
about nutrition, and of course the programs 
that feed them and their infants. 

There are other programs under the 
umbrella of the USDA not directly to 
the producer, such as a nonagricultural 
loan and grant program to communities 
and individuals. How about this, 
folks? A historic barn preservation; or 
studies of animal welfare to see if mice 
should be used in scientific research. 
All this is from the huge pot of money 
that made every headline, in every 
newspaper across the Nation as excess 
spending for production agriculture. 

So we thank the American taxpayer 
for funding those programs. We are trying 
to work on a bill, to be introduced 
before this week is out, for drought assistance. 
We cannot fight a natural 
hazard. If there were a way I could do 

it, I would. But we need just plain old 
rain and we need it before the spring 
thaw sets in. 

So we passed the unemployment benefits 
today. What I am saying is there 
are other wants and needs in this country, 
too, and they have to do with the 
security and the safety of a good, 
strong agricultural food program. Once 
the legislation is introduced, the debate 
will begin, and it will be an interesting 
debate. 

Mr. President, I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The assistant legislative clerk proceeded 
to call the roll. 

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

THE ECONOMY 
Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I spoke 
earlier today on unemployment compensation, 
and I am not going to repeat 
those statements. I think it is really 
unfortunate that some people maybe 
want to play politics with this issue. I 
don’t know. I am concerned. I am 
pleased we were able to pass a bill that 
will help a lot of Americans. I had resisted 
in the past and will continue to 
resist efforts to double the Federal program 
from 13 weeks to 26 weeks for 
every State. This is a Federally financed 
program—financed entirely by 
the Federal Government. In other 
words, people who participate in this 
program have already exhausted State 
benefits which are 26 weeks. Last year 
in March or April we passed a Federal 
program for 13 weeks of benefits. Some 
people are saying that 13 weeks should 
be 26 weeks. In other words, an unemployed 
person would be able to receive 
1 full year of unemployment compensation 
benefits regardless of whether or 
not they are in the high unemployment 
State. I disagree with that. If you continue 
to expand unemployment benefits 
for a longer duration, in some cases 
you are going to expand unemployment. 
It will create disincentives for 
people to go to work. 
I believe a fact of interest is that 70 
percent of people receiving unemployed 
benefits are living in a household with 
an employed worker. 
I just mention these facts not really 
to debate it but just to say there is a 
real concern trying to turn a Federal 
program which is to be temporary into 
a permanent program and to take a 
temporary program of 13 weeks for all 
States and make that 26 weeks. That is 
very expensive. I have strong reservations 
about it. I opposed that several 
times last year for months and will 
continue to do so if persons try to pass 
that proposal. 
I might also mention there are several 
other expansions of unemployment 
compensation in the bill that was promoted 
last year. I brought that to indi


viduals’ attention who were sponsoring 
it because I think it had fatal flaws. I 
think, more importantly, rather than 
just trying to figure out ways in which 
we could expand unemployment, we 
should be figuring out ways to expand 
employment. How can we grow the 
economy? How can we expand jobs? 
How can we create more jobs, and not 
reward people for not working but reward 
them for working? Let’s create 
greater incentives for work. 

The President’s speech today in Chicago 
outlined a growth package. I compliment 
him for it. It is different. In 
many cases, it is very good tax policy. 
I really hope when we work on tax 
issues that will work for things that 
are good tax policy. There are a lot of 
things under the present code that 
need to be changed and that need to be 
corrected that are wrong and that are 
real disincentives to grow, build or expand—
one of which is double taxation 
of dividends. 

I used to run a corporation. Why in 
the world would a corporation or somebody 
who runs a corporation want to 
pay dividends? The corporation has to 
pay a 35-percent tax on the earnings. 
And dividends come out after tax. So 
you have already paid a 35-percent 
rate. Then they are paid out to individuals. 
They also have to pay tax. The individual 
in all likelihood would be at a 
27-percent rate, or a 30-percent rate, or 
a 38-percent rate. So you had the 37 
percent plus the 35 percent. You are already 
at a 73-percent tax rate. If a corporation 
makes $100, $73 of the $100 
goes to taxation. That is not very good 
use of resources from a corporate manager’s 
position. It is not very encouraging 
of investment. A lot of us would 
like to eliminate that unfair penalty of 
double taxation. 

The President proposed that today. 
There are different ways of doing it. He 
proposed one. I compliment him for it. 
I also believe the President had a provision 
to allow greater use of what we 
call expensing—allowing individuals—I 
believe in this case small companies— 
to expense items, I believe up to 
$75,000. 

I used to run a small business. I have 
run a corporation. As I say, I have also 
run a small business. But if you allow 
small business to expense, they are 
going to be able to recoup the investment 
they make that year. They make 
the investment that year, they expense 
it, and they recoup that investment. 
That would greatly increase their incentives 
to make another investment. I 
think that is very positive for job creation, 
maybe the most positive as far 
as getting jobs for the dollars that we 
are talking about. 

So I am pleased the President has 
that in his proposal. I hope this Congress 
will aggressively pursue expensing 
and/or accelerated depreciation or 
more realistic depreciation schedules 
over the life of these properties. 

Far too many properties, under current 
tax laws and current regulations, 
require depreciation over a long period 


S22 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

of time, much longer, in some cases, 
than the actual lives of the property. 
That discourages investment. So I encourage 
our colleagues, if we want to 
create jobs, let’s work on accelerating 
depreciation or allow people to expense 
items or at least allow a shorter depreciation 
cycle for a lot of goods and 
services. 

One example is software. A year ago, 
I believe, or 2 years ago, the depreciable 
life of software was 5 years. It 
was the same thing for computers and 
equipment. But we all know software is 
obsolete in a couple years, and hardware, 
for the most part, is probably obsolete 
in 2 or 3 years, certainly not 5 
years. So allowing for a more realistic 
depreciation schedule makes sense. 

Another example is improvements 
that you would make for apartments 
and homes if you are in the rental business. 
Right now, you have to depreciate 
these improvements over 39 
years. If you have an apartment complex, 
and you want to make some investments 
to upgrade that apartment, 
you should be able to depreciate those 
improvements over a much shorter period 
of time than 39 years. It should be 
more like 15 years, maybe even 10 
years. If we made that change, a lot of 
people would make those investments. 
A lot of jobs would be created in the 
process. 

The President’s proposal also says 
that we should have acceleration of the 
tax cuts that are already on the books. 
I agree with him wholeheartedly. Tax 
cuts, some of which are now scheduled 
for 2004, some of which are scheduled 
for 2006, in my opinion, should be made 
immediate, January 1, 2003. 

If we want to have any positive economic 
impact from them, it does not 
do a lot of good knowing that they are 
going to come in a couple of years. 
Let’s make them immediate. I know 
some people want to play class warfare 
and say: Wait a minute, that is a tax 
cut for the wealthy. If we did it immediately, 
the maximum tax rate would 
be 35 percent. When President Clinton 
was elected, the maximum tax rate was 
31 percent. So it is still almost 20 percent 
higher than it was when President 
Clinton was elected. Now, 35 percent— 
why should the Federal Government be 
entitled to take over a third of what an 
individual makes? I believe 35 percent 
is a little over a third. 

So why is that such a bad deal? We 
have to look at taxation policy, what is 
right, what is fair. Should the Federal 
Government be entitled to automatically 
take that amount? 

I talk about marginal tax rates a lot 
because high marginal tax rates inhibit 
individuals, investors, entrepreneurs, 
small businesspeople, farmers, and 
ranchers from building and expanding 
if they have to work for the Government 
the majority of the time. 

I used to be self-employed. Self-employed 
individuals pay the highest 
marginal tax rates of anybody. And 
guess what they create: about 70 or 80 
percent of the jobs in America. You do 

not have to be very wealthy before you 
find out you are working as much for 
Uncle Sam as for yourself. 

I will give you an example. A self-employed 
individual who has a taxable income 
of $30,000 is in a 20-percent marginal 
Federal income-tax bracket. I believe 
any additional dollar they make 
above $27,000, $28,000 is taxed at a 27percent 
rate. That individual also has 
to pay what are commonly called FICA 
taxes, Social Security, and Medicare 
tax. That tax totals 15.3 percent. If you 
add 15.3 percent, plus the 27 percent, 
you get to 42.3 percent. So any additional 
dollar of income profits that the 
painter makes—I used to be a janitor— 
or a janitor makes, or someone who 
has some type of business, any profit 
they make above that $30,000, the Federal 
Government gets 42.3 percent of it. 

If they are working in most States, 
they end up paying a State income tax. 
There are a few States that do not have 
an income tax. Most States have an income 
tax of 6 or 7 percent. 

If you add 7 percent on top of the 42.3 
percent, you are already right at 50 
percent in taxes on any additional dollar 
of income generated from their 
work. That is a real disincentive to 
build, grow, or expand. I have been 
there. I was there with a janitorial 
service, so it did not take me very long 
to realize, wait a minute, why should 
this business grow if we are going to be 
working more for the Government than 
we work for ourselves? 

The President, talking about trying 
to accelerate the existing tax cuts that 
are on the books, is exactly right. It is 
a small reduction in marginal rates. 
Even at that, the rates are still much 
higher for upper income people, far 
higher than they were during the Clinton 
administration. 

The President has also proposed 
making the child tax credit effective 
immediately. Several years ago, we 
passed, as part of the 1997 bill, a $500 
tax credit per child. I was one of the 
sponsors of that. We passed that. That 
became law. That was good. In 2001, 
President Bush’s first tax bill, we 
passed another $500 tax credit per 
child, but we phased it in over several 
years. In the first year, we gave a $100 
tax credit. There is still $400 that becomes 
effective in the outyears. 

What the President has proposed is, 
let’s make that effective this year. I 
have heard some say: Wait a minute. 
The President’s proposal doesn’t do 
anything for people making $35,000 or 
$40,000 a year. 

That is not true. If they have one 
child, it is $400. If they have three children, 
that is $1,200 more per year they 
get to keep. 

So I urge my colleagues to look at 
the President’s proposal because I 
think it is a positive change. Let’s 
make that $1,000 tax credit per child effective 
this year, not $600, as is present 
law. Let’s make it $1,000 this year. 
That will help families. That will help 
individuals who have children as dependents. 


The President, as well, has also proposed 
making the marriage penalty 
elimination, that is now spread out 
over several years, effective immediately. 
The net impact of this is a 
great positive change for married couples, 
particularly married couples who 
have incomes in the range from $30,000 
to $40,000 to $50,000, $55,000. They will 
be the biggest beneficiaries of this proposal 
because the changes that we 
made in 2001 in the Tax Code say that 
really what we should do, for a married 
couple, is double the 15-percent bracket 
for an individual. 

I believe the figures are something 
like, an individual pays 15 percent on 
their taxable income up to about 
$27,750. But a couple pays 15 percent up 
to an income of about $46,400. So an individual 
pays 15 percent up to $27,750, 
but a couple pays—or another way of 
saying that is, anything above $27,750, 
an individual pays 27 percent, anything 
above $46,400, a couple has to pay 27 
percent. So if they were taxed as individuals, 
they could have a combined income 
of $55,500 before they would go 
into the 27-percent tax bracket. What 
we did in eliminating the marriage 
penalty relief was, over some period of 
time, double that individual 15-percent 
bracket. So the couple would not have 
to pay 27 percent until they had income 
above $55,500. Right now, they 
pay about $10,000 or $12,000 of that at 
the 27-percent bracket instead of the 
15-percent bracket. The net result is, 
you are talking about $1,200 in savings, 
tax savings for couples who have taxable 
incomes of $40,000 to $50,000. That 
is a pretty good change. If they have a 
couple kids, they get another $400 tax 
credit per child. So if you have four 
kids and a taxable income of $54,000, 
the way I am thinking, that is $1,600 
and $1,200, so $2,800. It is a pretty significant 
reduction and savings for a 
married couple with four kids with a 
taxable income of $50,000 or $60,000. And 
it happens to apply to a lot of middle-
income Americans. 

So I compliment the President for his 
combination of changes where he wants 
to grow the economy. It helps married 
families. It helps families with kids. It 
helps taxpayers. And it helps eliminate 
a well-known double taxation in the 
Tax Code, the double taxation of dividends 
that are really at exorbitant 
rates, which discourages investment, 
which discourages corporate ownership, 
which discourages equity, and encourages 
debt, which is not a very good 
policy—present law. 

The President says, let’s correct it. I 
think he is right in doing so. I look forward 
to working with my colleagues to 
see if we can’t work in a bipartisan 
fashion to put together a real package 
that will help grow jobs this year. 

I think that should be our challenge, 
not to say, here is the Democrat package, 
here is the Republican package. I 
say let’s work together as we have 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S23 

done historically in the Finance Committee 
to see if we can’t pass something 
good for America, good for American 
taxpayers and good for American 
families and good for our economy. 

We should have our economy grow. 
Revenues declined last year by 7 percent. 
Somebody said, why is there a 
deficit? There is a deficit because of 
the tax cut? 

The deficit is not because of the tax 
cut. It is because there has been a real 
recession. Revenues have declined because 
the stock market started declining 
dramatically in March of 2000. The 
Nasdaq index was at 5,000. It is around 
1,500, 1,600 now. So you see there has 
been a real decline in markets. That 
has caused a real decline in revenues to 
the Government. 

We need to do some positive things 
that will increase equity values and increase 
ownership in America’s companies, 
that will create jobs, that will 
create real growth in the economy. The 
President has outlined a constructive 
package. I look forward to working 
with the President and my colleagues 
to enact a positive package for America 
this year. 

I yield the floor and suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The assistant legislative clerk proceeded 
to call the roll. 

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

THANKING SUPPORTERS AND 
UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION 

Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise 
to spend a few minutes this afternoon 
commenting on the debate that is before 
the Senate, our challenge to shape 
an unemployment compensation package 
or relief package that will help 
workers and do what is right by them. 

Before I do, I wish to take a moment 
to thank many people, many friends, 
many family members who are gathered 
in Washington and at home in 
Louisiana and around the country for 
their support, their prayers, and their 
help in the recent election cycle. I am 
back in the Senate at work in large 
part because of so many wonderful people 
who went beyond the call of duty, 
beyond what is expected and believed 
in what our campaign represented and 
what we spoke about and what I spoke 
about—putting the interests of Louisiana 
first as it comes to representing 
that great State in this body, speaking 
about the issues people all over the Nation 
are concerned about, primarily the 
economy, keeping their families, their 
homes, their hearth together, protecting 
the Nation from the threat of 
terrorism, and shoring up our defenses 
against the great challenges before the 
Nation. 

I said many times over those months 
that it was important for us to speak 

the truth, that what Washington needed 
was leaders, not labels; that while 
we were proud of our parties respectively, 
we should not follow them 
blindly but should try to, as our new 
leader from Tennessee spoke this 
morning, put the country first. I hope 
his words and agenda and the words 
and agendas that come out of the Senate, 
fashioned by the men and women 
now in this body, will put the country 
first, will think about the fathers and 
mothers, the children, the workers who 
make up America, who are attempting 
as a nation, together, unified, black 
and white, Hispanic, Asian, and many 
other nationalities from all over the 
world, to speak with one voice to help 
lead this world in a challenging time. 

I thank particularly my husband and 
two children, the many members of my 
family, my parents, brothers and sisters 
and cousins. I joke often in Louisiana 
that one of the reasons I win is 
because if my family just votes for me, 
that is so many votes I always have a 
little advantage over my opponent. But 
truly, their votes, their work, and their 
prayers were noted in my heart today. 

I couldn’t think of a better way to 
thank the people of Louisiana and the 
Nation than to actually be on the floor 
of the Senate speaking about an issue 
important to them and taking a few 
minutes out of the festivities, as we all 
celebrate our return, our victories, 
large and small, to the Senate and to 
Washington, new assignments, et 
cetera, to spend a moment speaking 
about the unemployment insurance 
program and the desperate need of people 
in this country. 

We have not seen unemployment 
rates this high in so many years. We 
have not seen a downturn in the economy 
such as this in so many years. I 
rise to speak for a moment about the 
great need, as we fashion a stimulus 
package, as we fashion an aid package, 
not a charity package, not a handout 
package, but a hand up package, a 
package not to people who are 
undeserving, a package not to people 
who don’t work, a package not to people 
who don’t want to work, but a stimulus 
package that honors the strength 
of America, the fact that people are 
working not just one job in many cases 
but two and three jobs, in this time of 
uncertainty, moving from job to job, 
people doing whatever it takes to keep 
that mortgage paid, to keep their car 
notes paid, to invest in the tools and 
resources they need to keep their families 
together and keep their net worth 
growing, not decreasing. 

That has been a challenge for average 
Americans. It has been a challenge for 
everyone, as many people have seen 
their retirements shrink, not through 
any fault of their own. Every one realizes 
there is risk associated with investment. 
But I am sure the workers 
from Enron and WorldCom and others 
affected all over our country would 
have reason to stand on the floor of the 
Senate, if they could get here, and say, 
listen, some of this was out of my con


trol or my ability to manage or regulate. 


Some of it was done, as we know, 
fraudulently and without respect for 
the law. Frankly, maybe Congress 
didn’t have as tight reins on some of 
these situations as we should have. So 
there are Americans who are angry and 
anxious and frustrated. I most certainly 
appreciate that. Having just 
come off a long and grueling campaign, 
I heard from many of these workers in 
Louisiana. 

Here we are, the first day, trying to 
fashion a package. I have listened to 
people talking about the program. I 
want to explain the unemployment insurance 
program. First, there is $26 billion 
in the trust fund. It is a program, 
an enterprise established for the purposes 
of helping Americans when they 
need help. It is not a welfare or a charity 
program. There are certain times 
when welfare is good. And all the time, 
charity is good. But we are not talking 
about charity. We are talking about 
money that workers from their pockets 
put into a trust fund that grows with 
interest so when the economy turns 
down, they can, if the Members of Congress 
say it is OK, pull that money 
down, put it in their pocket, pay their 
car note, which makes the car dealer 
happy, pay their house note, which 
makes the banker happy, pay their 
loan to the credit card companies, 
which makes them happy, pay their 
money to the credit union that keeps 
the credit unions going, pay the grocery 
store, pay the gas bill, pay the 
cleaners to keep the small businesses 
going. Does anybody think these unemployment 
checks go in the bank just 
sitting there waiting to be invested? 

I hope not, because people who have 
worked hard at a $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 
job, who went to school sometimes late 
at night to get their skills, studied 
after putting their children to bed, way 
into the night, and worked hard to get 
those skills, now look to Washington 
to help. 

We have people on this floor who talk 
about this as if it is a charity program. 
These people are due, number one, the 
money they put in the trust fund. 
Number two, it is not their fault that 
unemployment is 6, 7, or 8 percent. It is 
our fault, if it is anybody’s fault, because 
we are not managing the situation 
well enough—not that it can be 
perfectly done, but it hasn’t happened 
yet. It most certainly is not the fault 
of the workers who have been laid off. 
They came not to ask for money that 
belongs to somebody else, but to ask us 
to give them their money so they can 
get through this hard time. 

We have to listen to House Republican 
leaders tell us that there is not 
enough money in the trust fund, when 
there is $26 billion in the trust fund, 
and we are arguing about whether we 
want something that costs $1 billion or 
$4 billion. And if we weren’t spending 
the unemployment trust fund now, 
when would we spend it? 

So for the 1.6 million full-time workers 
in Louisiana, for the 303,000 part



S24 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

time workers in Louisiana, for the 1.085 
million workers in Louisiana who work 
on an hourly wage, and for the 42,000 
workers in Louisiana who work at the 
minimum wage, $5.15—I will repeat 
that—$5.15—because this President and 
the Republican leadership refuse to increase 
the minimum wage, so these 
workers are working at $5.15 an hour 
because this President refuses to raise 
the minimum wage, or to support a 
raise in the minimum wage—we are 
going to tell these people that while 
there is $26 billion in the trust fund, we 
choose not to ‘‘expand’’ the program. 

Let me register my strongest objection 
to that, and let me on behalf of 
the 4.5 million people in my State register 
their strong objection to that and 
say how disappointed they are that this 
administration and the House Republican 
leadership refuse to give them 
the money they put in the fund so 
when times went bad they would have 
it to keep paying their house note, so 
they didn’t lose all the equity they 
have spent the last 20 years of their 
lives working for. 

Let me also object to the sentiment 
expressed too often on this floor that 
we have to give people an incentive to 
work. I don’t know too many people 
who don’t want to work. I really don’t. 
Whether they work for a paycheck or 
stay at home raising seven children, or 
nine children, or four children, they 
work very hard. I don’t know too many 
Americans who don’t want to work because 
with work comes dignity, with 
work comes self-satisfaction, with 
work comes thinking that you are 
doing something to help yourself and 
your family and your country. I know 
that a job or a small business is what 
most people aspire overwhelmingly to. 
But when that small business or that 
job slips out of their hands, not because 
they didn’t do a great job or because 
they don’t enjoy working, but because 
the company and because the 
policies that we are managing have 
come short, and we hand them that 
pink slip and we say, go for it, you 
have 13 weeks to find another job—a 
job having the same benefits and salary—
and when it runs out, we might 
consider giving you another 13 weeks, 
we have to look people in the eye and 
say I am sorry, there is no more help— 
when there is $26 billion sitting in this 
account. 

So I wanted to register my strongest 
objection to leaving out a portion of 
these workers and to say for the workers 
in my State that I am going to be 
here now for 6 years fighting for them, 
talking for them. I hope I can do it adequately 
to meet how worthy they are. 
I am going to do my very best to represent 
them in as forceful and effective 
way possible on this and many other 
issues. 

Let me close with giving a few concrete 
suggestions. If we are going to 
have a stimulus package, let’s be 
truthful and honest about the portions 
of it that will actually stimulate the 
economy and those that might stimu


late our conference next election time. 
I ask the administration to relook at 
their package. Why don’t we have the 
payroll tax holiday? The payroll tax 
holiday has been judged by conservative 
and liberal think tanks to be one 
of the most effective, immediate stimuli 
we can provide for the Nation. The 
money doesn’t have to come out of the 
Social Security trust fund. It can come 
out of the general fund, based on payroll 
taxes. It is fair to every worker— 
the very wealthy, the middle income, 
and the poor. It rewards the idea of 
work. It is immediate and it is $1,500 
per family. That $1,500 could be used 
immediately in this economy to give 
people confidence and to prime the 
pump, if you will. 

The Social Security offset—again, 
putting money into the hands of workers, 
retirees, people who have worked 
hard now, instead of getting both their 
full retirement checks—teachers in 
many instances are offset by their Social 
Security benefits—what good does 
that do if we can provide both, which 
we have the money to do, which is less 
expensive than this package, and give 
them both of those checks. 

Those people are in a time of their 
life when they are spending that 
money—not saving it, but spending it 
to live. That primes the pump in this 
Nation, as well as everything we can do 
to give depreciation for real estate, 
which would help in investments, and 
accelerating tax reductions for small 
business owners. But anything outside 
of that is actually nothing but stimulating 
some other special interests for 
other purposes, other than, in my opinion, 
strengthening this economy. That 
is wrong. 

I hope Congress and this Senate will 
work hard to fashion a stimulus package 
that is truly stimulative, affordable, 
financially responsible, and something 
that really helps all people, and 
not just those at the very top, but 
those who count on us to do our part to 
help them do what they are trying to 
do for their families and their communities. 


Mr. President, I am here giving my 
strongest support for moving forward 
with the unemployment compensation 
benefits, but very disappointed—extremely 
disappointed—that over a 
third to a half of workers in this Nation 
have been left out, and to say that 
we should include everyone, and we 
should focus on making the program 
better and more effective so that it is 
more helpful. I will tell you $182 a 
week, or $250 a week—the average payment 
in Louisiana—doesn’t go far. You 
cannot even pay a grocery bill for a 
family with three or four children with 
$200 a week. I don’t know where you 
get gas money, rent money, or mortgage 
payments on top of that. So this 
Congress has a lot to do when it comes 
to reforming, reshaping, revitalizing, 
and redesigning the unemployment insurance 
program for this Nation. I hope 
to be a part of that. But for today, extending 
that benefit—at least for all 

the workers who deserve it—again, it is 
not our money; it is theirs. They 
worked hard for it. There is $26 billion 
in the trust fund and we should give it 
to them. 

I yield the floor and I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
THOMAS). The clerk will call the roll. 

The assistant legislative clerk proceeded 
to call the roll.

THE MISSING MILLION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am 
happy we were able to get an extension 
of unemployment compensation earlier 
today so there is a seamless flow of 
checks from December 28 through the 
period of our new legislation. If we had 
not completed it today, and hopefully 
in the House tomorrow and with the 
President’s signature on Thursday, 
there would have been a lapse of those 
checks. We could have gone back and 
made up the difference but there still 
would have been a period of time that 
unemployed people would not get 
checks. I know there was a lot of concern 
on the other side of the aisle that 
we were trying to pass this too quickly. 
I am glad they backed down and allowed 
us to move ahead. 
During the debate that took the form 
of reserving the right to object, there 
were a number of statements made 
about what they wanted to do. I take 
the opportunity to clarify the record of 
what my Democratic colleagues were 
really talking about. A number of colleagues 
have made the statement that 
the unemployment extension we passed 
earlier today leaves out a million 
workers. 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S25 

Under the regular State unemployment 
program—and this is under longstanding 
law—workers are entitled to 
as much as 26 weeks of unemployment 
benefits. Under the temporary federally 
funded unemployment program 
that Congress passed last March, which 
we are continuing now, those who exhaust 
their State regular unemployment 
benefits can receive up to 13 
weeks of additional benefits. In addition, 
the program we passed last March 
provided up to 13 weeks of yet more 
benefits in extremely high unemployment 
States. In those high unemployment 
States, that means a maximum 
of 26 weeks of Federal benefits on top 
of the usual 26 weeks of State benefits. 
I repeat, workers in every State can 
collect 39 weeks of benefits—26 weeks 
State, plus 13 weeks Federal. And 
workers in high unemployment States 
can collect 52 weeks of benefits—26 
weeks of State benefits and 13 weeks 
Federal, plus an additional 13 weeks for 
unemployed people in the high unemployment 
States. 

As we discussed, the bill we passed 
earlier today would allow more than 2 
million workers to collect extended 
benefits through May of this year. According 
to some of my Democratic colleagues, 
that is not enough. They want 
to let workers who have collected 26 
weeks of regular State benefits plus 13 
weeks of federally funded benefits collect 
an additional 13 weeks of benefits, 
for a total of 52 weeks of benefits for 
everyone, every place, regardless of the 
unemployment rate of a particular 
State. In other words, the agreement 
we reached last March to provide up to 
9 months of benefits in every State, 
and 12 months of benefits in high unemployment 
States, is no longer good 
enough as indicated by the debate of 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle earlier this afternoon. They want 
12 months of benefits for everyone in 
every State regardless of whether unemployment 
is going up or going down. 

They claim extending last year’s 
agreement leaves out a million workers. 
I respectfully disagree. Their proposal 
goes well beyond anything Congress 
has ever done. It provides 12 
months of federally funded benefits to 
all workers in every State. While the 
national unemployment rate is higher 
than it was at this time last year, the 
unemployment rate in 20 States is now 
lower than it was a year ago. 

Under current law, no one can receive 
more in federally funded benefits 
than they received in State benefits. In 
other words, those who collect 26 weeks 
of State benefits could also collect 26 
weeks of federally funded benefits; but 
in those States that might have only 20 
weeks of State benefits, then there 
would only be 20 weeks of federally 
funded benefits under current law. So 
there is a link between what we give in 
Federal benefits and State benefits. 
This link is designed to give States the 
ability to honor their unemployment 
program. 

Although we have not seen the latest 
version, the Democratic proposal would 

break this link. By breaking the link, 
it would pay federally funded benefits 
without regard to the 26 week level of 
State benefits. This represents a very 
historic and unprecedented expansion 
of the unemployment program. 

While we may need to revisit the 
issue of unemployment benefits later 
this year, it seems to me that we 
should carefully review this proposal 
before final action. In the meantime, 
we have had an opportunity to make 
sure that there is a seamless flow of 
checks from December 28, now, to 
those 750,000 unemployed people who 
would otherwise have had a lapse in receiving 
unemployment compensation, 
plus probably 2.5 million people connected 
with those respective families. 
And, for people on the other side of the 
aisle who think they have legitimacy 
and want to discuss these additional 
issues, the institution of the Senate is 
very prone towards hearing any idea 
that Senators want presented, having 
an environment or a forum for the 
presentation of that. So we probably 
will be forced to, and maybe ought to, 
review what the Democrats propose 
today. But we should not do it in an environment 
as we had today. If it had 
been adopted today, I am sure the 
House of Representatives would not 
have accepted it and, obviously, if we 
had gone to conference to work out the 
differences, no bill would have been 
presented to the President of the 
United States by Thursday—for his signature 
in time, then, to keep a seamless 
flow of unemployment checks. 

So I am glad we were able to work 
this out. Obviously, as chairman of the 
Senate Finance Committee, I have to 
be open to discussion of any issues 
dealing with unemployment. I look forward 
to those discussions but in an environment 
that does not stall the flow 
of checks for people who are deserving 
of them, and that is those people who 
would have otherwise been cut off on 
December 28. 

I yield the floor and I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will 
again suggest the absence of a quorum, 
but I ask the time be evenly charged 
against each side. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. GRASSLEY. I now suggest the 
absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are 
going to have a vote in a short time. It 
is going to be a vote on adjourning the 
Senate. That is what the vote will be. 

But in substance it is more than 
that. We have had a number of Senators 
here who have requested a vote 
on adjournment. The reason they have 
done that is because they believe they 
should be able to have a vote on unemployment 
benefits for the people who 
are not covered in the legislation we 
just passed. So let there be no mistake, 
even though this procedurally is a vote 
on adjourning the Senate, the substantive 
aspect of this vote is that people 
who vote to adjourn the Senate 
today at approximately 5 o’clock will 
be voting to not allow about 1 million 
people to have unemployment benefits. 

That is what this is about. I have 
told my friend, my counterpart, that 
there are a number of people who believed 
a vote was inappropriate. There 
are people who have worked on both 
sides of the aisle not to have a vote 
today. But there are a number of people 
who believe the vote is important. 
I want to make sure, before that vote 
occurs at 5 o’clock, that people know 
what the purpose of the vote is. 

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, 
with all due respect to my friend from 
Nevada, the motion to adjourn will 
have absolutely nothing to do with unemployment 
benefits. It is simply, in 
the judgment of this Senator, an ill-advised 
attempt to disrupt what is typically 
a ceremonial day. We have Members 
of the Senate who were sworn in 
today—some of them brand new, some 
of them for the second and third and 
fourth and fifth terms—who have family 
in town. They are scattered all 
about the Capitol and off the Capitol 
with receptions for their friends. 

There is nothing, I would say, that 
the other side could do today on this 
issue that they could not do on Thursday 
on this issue. If they want to make 
a point on the subject, certainly that is 
always possible in the Senate, the Senate 
being the Senate. 

But this is going to be extremely disruptive 
to the Members and their families. 
I am told by floor staff there is 
nothing we can do to prevent this vote, 
and so we will have it. But hopefully 
we will have it with enough notice to 
give our colleagues, who are scattered 
around town with their families and 
friends, an opportunity to come back 
and cast a completely unnecessary 
vote, which has nothing to do with 
anything other than whether or not we 
adjourn tonight. 

Make no mistake about it, this is a 
meaningless vote. It is simply a procedural 
vote that we normally would not 
take at the end of the day. No effort to 
describe it otherwise would be sufficient 
to convince anyone that this is 
anything more than simply a motion 
to adjourn. 

Mr. President, I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 


S26 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY NOMINATIONS 

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today the 
Senate received from the President the 
nominations for the positions of Secretary 
of Homeland Security and Deputy 
Secretary of Homeland Security. I 
understand that these nominations will 
be referred to the Committee on Governmental 
Affairs because at this time 
the primary responsibility of these two 
officials will be to implement the 
structural reorganization of disparate 
entities into this new agency. I understand 
that in the future nominations 
for various positions created by the 
Homeland Security Act of 2002 may be 
referred on the basis of the responsibilities 
of those officials at that time, and 
that the initial referral of these nominations 
will not serve as precedent 
binding the Chair in the future.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 

THE SALT RIVER PROJECT’S 100TH 

ANNIVERSARY 
S Mr. KYL. Mr. President, my best 
wishes today go to the Salt River 
Project on the celebration of its centennial 
of service to the communities 
of central Arizona. 

When the Salt River Project, or SRP, 
was created on February 7, 1903, Arizona 
was still a territory and the people 
who had settled its central desert 
valleys had just endured a period of 
devastating droughts. They knew the 
future of their farms, businesses, and 
families depended on securing a reliable 
supply of water. If they failed, 
they were sure to witness the continued 
withering of their farms and livelihoods. 


With commitment, they banded together 
to form the Salt River Valley 
Water Users Association, later to become 
SRP. With courage, they mortgaged 
their lands as debt collateral for 
a federal loan that was granted under 
terms of the National Reclamation Act 
of 1902. And the result eight years later 
was the completion of a great monolithic 
stone dam that was named after 
the President, Theodore Roosevelt. It 
would be the first of other dams and 
water works built through partnership 
with SRP and federal and local governments 
to ensure the economic vitality 
of my native state. 

Without Roosevelt Dam, Arizona’s 
early communities could not have 
grown. Similarly, growth would not 
have continued without SRP’s development 
and management of early hydro-
power resources and later leadership 
and partnership in constructing extensive 
generation and transmission systems 
to fuel Arizona’s economy. 

In the past century, SRP has become 
Arizona’s largest water supplier and 

the third largest public power provider 
in the nation. It has gained a reputation 
as a utility with a record for service, 
safety, and commitment to the environment 
and human services. As SRP 
celebrates its centennial, it deserves 
recognition for its past achievements 
and for the important role it will continue 
to play in Arizona’s advancement 
in the 21st century.S

TRIBUTE TO GOVERNOR FELIX 

CAMACHO AND LT. GOVERNOR 

KALEO MOYLAN 

S Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, hafa adai 
and happy new year from our Nation’s 
capital. It gives me great pleasure to 
congratulate Governor Felix Camacho 
and Lt. Governor Kaleo Moylan on 
their inauguration day as the seventh 
elected governor and lieutenant governor 
of Guam. 

Guam’s people have shown their patriotism 
to America time and time 
again Indeed, it is this allegiance, coupled 
with a rich island culture, that 
make Guam so unique in our American 
family and an integral and indispensable 
part of our nation. As incoming 
Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee 
on Interior and Related 
Agencies, I look forward to working 
with both the governor and lieutenant 
governor, as we tackle Guam’s present 
challenges. 

As they embark on rebuilding their 
community, some progress will be swift 
and dramatic. At other times, improvements 
may be slower and only with 
perseverance and diligent hard work 
will they be finally achieved. Together, 
Guam and Washington will overcome 
these challenges. 

I join the people of Guam in congratulating 
Governor Felix Camacho 
and Lt. Governor Kaleo Moylan, once 
again, and I look forward to meeting 
and working with them to address 
their island’s needs. For this reason 
and in order to memorialize this moment, 
I have submitted this letter to 
be published in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD on January 7, 2003.S

RETIREMENT OF JERRY SONGY 
S Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in 1998, the 
Senate passed the Internal Revenue 
Service Restructuring and Reform Act, 
which I strongly supported. This landmark 
legislation set the Internal Revenue 
Service, IRS, on a new course, one 
that most Members of this body would 
agree is the right one. Today, the IRS 
is much more focused on customer 
service and education to achieve compliance 
with the Nation’s tax laws. 

It takes more than a new law, however, 
to change the way an agency fulfills 
its mission. It takes talented people 
committed to those reforms in 
order to turn the words in the statute 
into reality. We all know the role that 
former Commissioner Charles O. 
Rossotti played in restructuring the 
agency, and I commend him again for 
his invaluable service to the IRS and 
the Nation. 

Today, I rise to recognize one of Mr. 
ROSSotti’s key aides, Jerry Songy, who 

is retiring after 34 years of dedication 
to agency. In early 1998, Jerry was selected 
to lead an organizational modernization 
effort that was intended to 
transform the IRS into a more customer-
focused organization. Jerry’s 
contributions to this business-process 
reengineering effort have greatly improved 
the delivery of products and 
services to all of America’s taxpayers, 
and small businesses and the self-employed 
taxpayers in particular. 

In addition to serving as Executive 
Director, Modernization Design, Jerry 
was instrumental in the design of the 
Small Business/Self-Employed, SB/SE, 
operating division, which serves approximately 
45 million small businesses 
and self-employed taxpayers. He 
was also a driving force in the creation 
of the Taxpayer Education and Communication, 
TEC, section and has led 
the SB/SE division in its outreach and 
education efforts to small business and 
self-employed taxpayers. As the former 
Chairman and Ranking Member of the 
Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
I had the pleasure of 
working with Jerry in that capacity. 

Through his efforts, the IRS has created 
innovative web site applications, 
multilingual CDs, and a series of web 
cast programs to assist taxpayers with 
their tax filing and payment responsibilities. 
The IRS has partnered with 
tax practitioner and payroll organizations, 
trade and professional organizations, 
educational institutions, and 
corporate America on joint tax education 
initiatives. In short, our constituents 
are seeing the tangible benefits 
of Jerry’s hard work on behalf of 
small enterprises across the nation. 

Jerry was born and raised in New Orleans, 
LA and graduated from Loyola 
University with a Bachelor of Science 
degree in Accounting. He has two sons, 
three grandchildren, and will be joined 
in retirement by his wife, Lea, who 
also has had a distinguished career 
with the IRS. 

On behalf of the 45 million small 
businesses and self-employed taxpayers 
throughout the country that have benefitted 
from his hard work and dedication, 
I commend Jerry Songy for his 

exemplary contributions to public 
service.S

TRIBUTE TO BONNIE NICKOL 

S Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Bonnie Nickol 
of Little Rock, Arkansas, who has committed 
herself to helping working families 
in Arkansas through the Arkansas 
Single Parent Scholarship Fund. 

Bonnie’s first involvement with the 
scholarship fund came in 1997. The 
fund’s director, Ralph Nesson, knowing 
of Bonnie’s interest in education, introduced 
her to several of the people 
who benefit from this statewide network 
of scholarship programs that help 
single parents get the education they 
need to better provide for their families. 
Bonnie was touched by the efforts 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S27 

of these women and men to raise children, 
hold steady jobs, and attend college—
and she resolved to help. 

And help she did. Upon learning that 
the Pulaski County Single Parent 
Scholarship Fund was able to offer 
only about 10 scholarships per year, 
and that many deserving single parents 
were being turned away due to a lack 
of funds and resources. Bonnie joined 
the board of directors and committed 
herself to expanding the program. 
From 1998 until 2002, Bonnie chaired 
the fund’s board of directors. Under her 
leadership, the fund began to grow dramatically. 
In 1998, the fund awarded 16 
scholarships worth a total of $8,000. By 
2002, the fund was awarding 98 scholarships 
worth more than $63,000. That’s 
an increase of 600 percent in just four 
years. On top of that, the amount of 
each scholarship awarded increased by 
$150, meaning that every recipient is 
now enjoying a more generous benefit 
than ever before. The Single Parent 
Scholarship Fund has also raised its 
profile by pursuing corporate and foundation 
grants and through private 
fund-raising events. 

In addition to increasing the fund’s 
size, Bonnie has spearheaded the effort 
to provide enhanced support services to 
scholarship recipients. Among these 
services are volunteer mentors and 
loaned computers to help ensure student 
success. In addition, Bonnie made 
a point of forging personal relationships 
with many of the scholarship recipients, 
meeting with each of them 
once per semester to encourage them 
and seek feedback; coordinating the selection 
process to ensure that scholarships 
are awarded in a fair, timely, and 
efficient manner; and continually 
working to improve service available 
to recipients. 

These efforts are paying real dividends 
for the fund in terms of success. 
Since January 1998, an astonishing 94 
percent of scholarship recipients have 
either graduated or are still in school 
working toward their degrees. Fifty-
eight parents have graduated since 
1998. That’s a tremendous record of 
success, for which Bonnie and all of the 
other volunteers with the Arkansas 
Single Parent Scholarship Fund can be 
justifiable proud. 

Bonnie Nickol will retire from the 
Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship 
Fund this year, and while her leadership 
will be sorely missed, others who 
share Bonnie’s vision and commitment 
will most certainly follow. In the 
meantime, she continues to provide her 
valuable leadership and volunteer energy 
for a number of groups in Arkansas, 
including New Futures for Youth, 
the Jewish Federation of Arkansas, 
and the Artspace Artists Cooperative. 
But of all her contributions, her most 
impressive may be the work that she’s 
done with the Arkansas Single Parent 
Scholarship Fund, work that has made 
it possible for dozens of single parents 
in Arkansas to get their degrees and 
improve their job prospects for the future. 
I salute Bonnie’s efforts, and I 

hope that others will look to her as an 
example of how one person can lend 
their time, talents, and energy to make 
a difference in his or her community 
and in the lives of others.S

TRIBUTE TO FALLEN 

FIREFIGHTERS 
S Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, on November 
25, 2002, Oregonians were reminded 
once again what the whole nation 
witnessed on September 11, 2001, 
that the men and women who run into 
burning buildings when everyone else 
is running out, are true heroes. 

For it was on November 25, 2002, 
when Randy Carpenter, Jeffrey Common 
and Chuck Hanners, all members 
of the Coos Bay Fire Department, gave 
their lives while protecting others, 
when the roof of a warehouse collapsed 
during a fire. 

Randy Carpenter was a thirteen year 
veteran of the Coos Bay Fire Department. 
He was a mentor to many young 
firefighters, and was respected as a 
man of integrity and professionalism. 
Along with fighting fires, Randy built 
houses and taught emergency medical 
aid classes. He was a loving father to 
two daughters. 

Like his father, Jeffrey Common was 
a volunteer member of the Coos Bay 
Fire Department. He worked in the 
tugboat business and was the devoted 
father of three young children. 

Chuck Hanners was also a volunteer 
member of the Coos Bay Fire Department. 
He served as the manager of a retail 
sporting goods department, but always 
carried a scanner in his back 
pocket so he could rush to a fire whenever 
help was needed. He left behind a 
wife and six children. 

At a very moving memorial service, 
which was attended by over 7,000 community 
members and delegations of 
firefighters from across Oregon and the 
Pacific Northwest, Chuck’s 17-year-old 
son, Daniel, read from the Firefighter’s 
Prayer. The last line of this prayer 
says, ‘‘If according to fate, I am to lose 
my life, please bless with your hand my 
children and my wife.’’ 

I join with countless other Oregonians 
in extending my prayers and condolences 
to the family, friends, and colleagues 
of these three courageous Oregonians. 
While I was not privileged to 
know Randy, Jeff, and Chuck, I know 
of the pride they took in serving as a 
first responder, and I know that in giving 
themselves for others, they made 
themselves special, not just to us, but 
to God. The Bible tells us that ‘‘Greater 
love than this has no man than to 
lay down his life for his friends.’’ Because 
God is love, we know He was 
there with them when they died, and 
that He is with them still. 

One of America’s most beautiful 
monuments to courage and unselfish 
service is the National Fallen Firefighters 
Memorial in Emmitsburg, MD. 
Flags at this Memorial were flown at 
half-staff in honor of Randy, Jeff and 
Chuck. And their names will also be 

added to a plaque at the monument, 
which stands near an eternal flame 
that represents the spirit of the firefighter, 
past, present, and future. 

The holiday season was a tough one 
for many in Coos Bay, but I hope that 
community members can take solace 
in the fact that they are fortunate to 
live in a community and we are all fortunate 
to live in a country that produces 
individuals like Randy, Jeff, and 
Chuck, individuals who are willing 
every day to risk their life so others 
might be safe. May God Bless the men 
and women of the Coos Bay Fire Department, 
and all fire department 
across the country, and may God Bless 
America.S

DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP PRIORITIES 
FOR THE 108TH CONGRESS 

Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, officially, 
the Congress that ended in December 
was the 107th Congress. But 
history will almost surely record it as 
the September 11th Congress. From the 
moment the first plane hit the first 
tower until the last moments of the 
lameduck session, helping America recover 
from that horrific day, bringing 
its plotters to justice and making 
changes to protect America from future 
terrorist attacks dominated the 
Senate’s agenda. 

We continued that work—even as we 
confronted unprecedented challenges in 
the Senate: anthrax, the rise of new 
threats to our Nation, and the loss of 
our friend and colleague, Paul 
Wellstone. 

Through tragic and historic events, 
the 107th Senate under Democratic 
control produced a number of important 
legislative accomplishments: aviation 
security and counterterrorism legislation; 
the toughest corporate accountability 
law since the SEC was 
created in 1934; the most far-reaching 
campaign finance reforms since Watergate; 
the most significant overhaul of 
Federal education policies since 1965; 
and a new farm bill to replace the 
failed Freedom to Farm Act. 

However, other important legislation 
fell victim to special-interest arm-
twisting, and the other party’s unwillingness 
to compromise on their proposals, 
or even consider ours. We saw 
that on proposals to dedicate greater 
resources to homeland security, a 
Medicare prescription drug benefit, and 
a real, enforceable patients’ bill of 
rights. 

The proposals we are introducing 
today recognize that the American people 
have real concerns about their security, 
and that Republicans and the 
Bush administration have not done 
enough to address those concerns. 

But they also recognize that security 
means more than national security, 
and homeland security. It means economic 
security, retirement security, 
and the security of knowing that our 
children are getting a good education, 
and that, if you get sick, health care is 
available and affordable. It means giving 
people who work fulltime the security 
of knowing they can earn a decent 
wage—whether they work on a farm, in 
a factory, or at a fast-food restaurant. 
It is the security of knowing that our 
air is safe to breathe and our water is 

safe to drink, that America is living up 
to its commitment to civil rights, and 
that we are keeping our promises to 
our veterans. 

Democrats are committed to tackling 
terrorism abroad, and making our 
country more secure. 

One of our first priorities will be to 
make Americans safer by enhancing 
protections for our ports, borders, food 
and water supplies, and chemical and 
nuclear plants. 

We are introducing a bill to commit 
real resources to doing all of those 
things, and to hiring more police and 
first responders and providing them the 
tools and training to do the difficult 
jobs we are now asking them to do. 

We also recognize that national 
strength also depends on economic 
strength, and in the last 2 years, America’s 
economy has weakened. In the 
coming weeks, we will put forward our 
ideas for how best to stimulate the 
economy in the short term. 

But, in the long term, one of the 
most important things we can do is 
give people greater confidence that 
their private pensions will be there for 
them. That is why another of our leadership 
bills is one to strengthen pension 
protections, expand pension coverage, 
and crack down on rogue corporations. 


It has been said that almost every 
problem any society faces can be 
solved with two things: good health, 
and a good education—and we have 
bills in each of those areas. 

The Right Start for Children Act 
makes Head Start fully available for 4-
and 5-year-olds, and increases availability 
for infants and toddlers. It will 
help improve childcare quality, make 
childcare more affordable for 1 million 
additional children, and strengthen 
child nutrition programs to reduce 
child hunger. 

The Educational Excellence for All 
Learners Act builds on that foundation 
by improving education every step of 
the way—from kindergarten, to college, 
to lifelong learning. It makes sure 
that we match the real reforms we 
passed last year with the real resources 
they demand. It will help us recruit, 
hire, and train qualified teachers, build 
new schools, and make college and job 
training more affordable and more 
available. 

President Bush pledged to leave no 
child behind, and then proposed more 
than a billion dollars of education cuts. 
We are proposing to put our money 
where the Republicans’ mouths are— 
and help secure a good start, a good 
education, and good prospects for all 
Americans. 

When it comes to health care, it was 
an outrage that 40 million Americans 
were uninsured 2 years ago. In the past 
year, over 1 million more Americans 
have lost health insurance. And those 
who are lucky enough to have health 
insurance are seeing their premiums 
skyrocket. 

With the Health Care Coverage Expansion 
and Quality Improvement Act, 
we hope to reduce the number of uninsured 
by making health care coverage 
more available to small businesses, 
parents of children eligible for 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S39 

CHIP and Medicaid, pregnant women, 
and others. 

We also want to improve the quality 
of care people receive by overcoming 
Republican resistance to a real, enforceable, 
patients’ bill of rights. 

We will also insist that mental illness 
be treated like any other illness— 
something that will not only honor 
Paul Wellstone’s legacy, but also help 
millions of families. 

We are also committed to passing a 
prescription drug benefit under Medicare, 
and lowering the price of prescription 
drugs for all Americans. Last 
year, we passed a bill to lower the price 
of generic drugs, but the House refused 
to take it up. And we had 52 Senators 
support our Medicare prescription drug 
benefit—but it was blocked on a procedural 
motion. 

The high cost of prescription drugs— 
combined with the increasing need for 
such drugs—is destroying the life savings—
and threatening the dignity—of 
millions of older Americans. And that 
is simply unacceptable. 

A couple of months ago in elections 
all across the country, and in words 
spoken here in the Senate, we have 
seen that when it comes to protecting 
equal rights, we still have a lot of work 
to do in changing hearts, minds, and 
laws. 

That is why we are introducing The 
Equal Rights and Equal Dignity for 
Americans Act. This bill will enforce 
employment nondiscrimination, fund 
the election-reform measures we 
passed last year, outlaw hate crimes, 
and take other steps to see that as a 
nation, we live up to the promise of 
equal rights. 

I hope those Republicans who have 
recently expressed their support for 
civil rights will join us in expressing 
their support for this legislation. I also 
hope they will join us in supporting our 
bill to combat drug and gun violence, 
to crack down on new crimes like identity 
theft, and to protect against and 
prevent crimes against children and 
seniors. 

We also need to ensure greater dignity 
for our minimum wage workers, 
our farmers, and our veterans. The purchasing 
power of the minimum wage is 
now the lowest it has been in more 
than 30 years. And a full-time minimum 
wage income won’t get you over 
the poverty line. If we can afford over 
a trillion dollars in tax cuts for those 
at the top of the income scale, we can 
afford a dollar fifty more an hour for 
those at the bottom. 

We need to help our rural economy, 
and help those impacted by a drought 
and other natural disasters that are 
being called among the costliest for agricultural 
producers in our Nation’s 
history. 

And we need to maintain our commitment 
to those currently serving, 
and keep our promises to our veterans. 
One way we do that is by allowing our 
wounded veterans to receive both their 
full disability and retirement benefits. 
Another way is by addressing the cur


rent crisis in veterans’ health care. 
With each of these proposals—we stand 
with the leading veterans organizations, 
and for those who served our 
country. 

Finally, we are committed to stopping 
what is adding up to an all-out assault 
on our environment. By unilaterally 
abandoning the Kyoto process, the 
Bush administration took us out of position 
to lead the world on the issue of 
climate change. The Global Climate 
Security Act will help America reassert 
our position of world leadership 
on this vital issue of world health. 

Each of these things is relevant, not 
revolutionary. If they seem familiar, it 
is because most of what is in them has 
been introduced before. 

But they are not law, despite the support 
of the American people and, in 
some cases, a bipartisan majority of 
Senators. 

They have been opposed by an extreme 
few, and their special interest 
supporters. And while those bills have 
languished, we have seen the rise of 
more threats to our country; more people 
have lost their jobs and their 
health care; and more of our national 
challenges have gone unmet. 

These are our priorities. In the last 
couple of days, the President has made 
clear his priorities—more tax cuts for 
those who need them least. 

The President’s plan won’t help middle 
income families. It won’t contribute 
to economic growth; it won’t 
make our homeland more secure; it 
won’t expand educational opportunity 
for the young, or strengthen health 
care for the elderly. 

Instead—by putting us deeper into 
deficit and debt—it makes all of these 
things, and all of our other goals, harder 
to achieve. 

Our bills will help us create an America 
that is stronger, safer, and better 
for all Americans—and I hope my colleagues 
will join me in supporting 
them.

By Mrs. HUTCHISON: 

S. 26. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to provide that 
dividend and interest income of individuals 
not be taxed at rates in excess 
of the maximum capital gains rate; to 
the Committee on Finance. 
Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to introduce a package of 
three bills I hope will be the starting 
point for a long overdue discussion on 
reducing taxes on investment income, 

particularly dividends. The first bill 
would completely eliminate taxes on 
dividends. The second bill would reduce 
the tax on dividends to the capital 
gains rate. The third bill would lower 
the tax to the capital gains rate on 
dividends and interest income. These 
bills would not only stimulate the 
economy, but also correct long-term 
problems with the tax code. 

The economy is currently on the way 
to recovery but faces significant bottlenecks 
along the way. Following a 
mild recession, we are experiencing 
moderate growth. Many believe we will 
continue on a slow yet steady pace, but 
we are not yet in the clear. We must 
take aggressive steps to create jobs and 
ensure the economy gets moving again. 

The most effective tool government 
has for promoting growth is the tax 
code. By lowering taxes we allow people 
to keep more of their money and 
spend it more effectively than the government 
ever could. 

Lowering the taxes on investment income 
would stimulate the economy on 
several levels. First, we would leave 
more money in the pockets of families 
to spend. Second, lowering taxes on 
dividends would encourage investors to 
re-enter the stock market and realize 
higher returns since the government 
would be taking less. The increased demand 
for stocks would stabilize the 
market and encourage economic 
growth. Third, these tax cuts would ultimately 
help to reduce the deficit as 
tax revenues increase from higher economic 
growth and increased capital 
gains revenue. 

A tax cut on investment income 
would particularly help the elderly and 
others who rely on fixed incomes. A 
third of seniors received dividend income 
and more than half of dividends 
go to seniors. With such pressures as 
the rising cost of healthcare, it is critical 
that we let them keep as much of 
their money as possible. Also, these tax 
cuts would help a broad cross-section 
of Americans. For example, almost half 
of those who receive dividends have income 
of less than $50,000. 

One of the problems with our tax 
code is the double taxation of dividends. 
People have already paid taxes 
on the money they use to invest. Then 
they must pay taxes on their investment 
income. This is not fair and discourages 
savings. 

Also, companies must use after-tax 
dollars to pay dividends. Investors then 
have to pay taxes on their dividend income 
at the ordinary income tax rates. 
This leads to two unintended consequences. 


First, it encourages investors to 
focus on returns through stock price 
appreciation, which are taxed at the 
lower capital gains rate. People are encouraged 
to invest in higher growth, 
but often in riskier companies, rather 
than more stable, dividend-paying 
companies. As anyone can see from the 
collapse of stock prices in high-growth 
sectors over the past two years, the 
current incentives in the tax code may 


S40 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

not lead to the best decisions for investors. 


Second, the double taxation of dividends 
encourages companies to raise 
capital by loading up on debt rather 
than issuing stock, because interest expense 
on debt can lower a company’s 
taxes while dividend payments do not. 
This leads to an increase in highly leveraged 
companies that are at greater 
financial risk when the economy slows. 

Whether investors should invest in 
growth stocks is a decision that must 
be left to individuals. Likewise, the 
issuance of debt is best decided by the 
company in question. By lowering the 
tax rates on dividends and interest income, 
we would reduce the influence of 
taxes on these decisions. 

Increasingly, America is a Nation of 
investors. Today, half of U.S. households 
own stock. The number of shareholders 
has increased more than 60 percent 
since 1989. Thus, it is critical to 
ensure our tax laws lead to rational decisionmaking; 
decisions based on the 
best investment choices, not guided by 
tax inequities. Let’s take tax rates out 
of the capital allocation decision process. 
People should make investment 
decisions based on what is the best investment. 


I call on the Senate to bolster the 
economy, help senior citizens meet 
their financial needs, and level the way 
we tax investment gains by lowering 
taxes on investment income. Today, I 
offer three alternatives I hope will lead 
to a constructive discussion and action 
to achieve these goals. 

I ask unanimous consent the text of 
the bills be printed in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bills 
were ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

HARKIN): 


S42 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

S. 27 A bill to amend the Packers and 
Stockyards Act, 1921, to make it unlawful 
for packet to own, feed, or control 
livestock intended for slaughter; 
to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, 
and Forestry. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the 
goal of the farm bill was to improve 
the economic condition of America’s 
farmers over the next few years. However 
one of the many shortcomings of 
the new law is that it fails to protect 
family farmers and independent livestock 
producers from vertical integration 
in the livestock industry. 

In recent years, family farmers from 
across Iowa have contacted me to express 
their fears about the threat they 
fell from concentration in the livestock 
industry. They fear that if the 
trend toward increased concentration 
continues, they may be unable to compete 
effectively and will not be able to 
get a fair price for their livestock in 
the marketplace. 

The bill I am introducing would prevent 
meat packers from assuming complete 
control of the meat supply by 
preventing packers from owning livestock. 


This bill would make it unlawful for 
a packer to own or feed livestock intended 
for slaughter. Single pack entities 
and packs too small to participate 
in the Mandatory Price Reporting program 
would be excluded from the limitation. 
In addition, farmer cooperatives 
in which the members own, feed, 
or control the livestock themselves 
would be exempt under this new bill. 

We have tightened down the limitations 
in this new version of the packer 
ban. The last version provided an exemption 
to plants that killed less than 
2 percent of the Nation’s livestock, per 
commodity. That meant plants that 
killed less than 1.9 million pigs or approximately 
725,000 cattle were excluded 
under the old version. We have 
changed the standard to be consistent 
with the Mandatory Price Reporting 
law and other legislation I’ve introduced. 
That means the new limit will 
be 125,000 for cattle and 100,000 for 
swine. 

It’s also important to realize that 
this is not the original version I cosponsored 
with Senator JOHNSON. Instead, 
this is the version I successfully 
offered on the floor during the debate 
on the farm bill that removed the word 
‘‘control’’ so that the packers couldn’t 
attack us with a red-herring argument. 

It’s important for our colleagues to 
remember that family farmers ultimately 
derive their income from the 
agricultural marketplace, not the farm 
bill. Family farmers have unfortunately 
been in a position of weakness 
in selling their product to large processors 
and in buying their inputs from 
large suppliers. 

Today, the position of the family has 
become weaker as consolidation in agribusiness 
has reached all time highs. 
Farmers have fewer buyers and suppliers 
than ever before. The result is an 
increasing loss of family farms and the 

smallest farm share of the consumer 
dollar in history. 

One hundred years ago, this Nation 
reacted appropriately to citizen concerns 
about large, powerful companies 
by establishing rules constraining such 
businesses when they achieved a level 
of market power that harmed, or 
risked harming, the public interest, 
trade and commerce. The United State 
Congress enacted the first competition 
laws in the world to make commerce 
more free and fair. These competition 
laws include the Sherman Act, Clayton 
Act, Federal Trade Commission Act 
and Packers & Stockyards Act. 

Since that time, many countries in 
the world have followed this U.S. example 
to constrain undue market 
power in their domestic economies. 

Unfortunately, competition policy 
has been severely weakened in this 
country, especially in agriculture, due 
to Federal case law, underfunded enforcement, 
and unfounded reliance on 
efficiency claims. The result has been a 
significant degradation of the domestic 
agricultural market infrastructure. 
The current situation reflects a tremendous 
mis-allocation of resources 
across the food chain. Congress must 
strengthen competition policy within 
the farm sector to reclaim a properly 
operating marketplace. 

While this legislation does not accomplish 
all that we need to do in this 
area, it’s an important first step toward 
remedying the biggest problem 
facing farmers today, the problem of 
concentration. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of the bill be printed in the 
RECORD.

By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself 
and Mr. ALLARD): 

S. 30. A bill to redesignate the Colonnade 
Center in Denver, Colorado, as 
the ‘‘Cesar E. Chavez Memorial Building’’; 
to the Committee on Environment 
and Public Works. 
Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, 
today I am introducing legislation to 
name the Federal building located at 
1244 Speer Boulevard, Denver CO, as 
the ‘‘Cesar E. Chavez Memorial Building.’’ 


Cesar E. Chavez was an ordinary 
American who left behind an extraordinary 
legacy of commitment and accomplishment. 


Born on March 31, 1927 in Yuma, AZ 
on a farm his grandfather homesteaded 
in the 1880’s, he began his life as a migrant 
farm worker at the age of 10 
when the family lost the farm during 
the Great Depression. Those were desperate 
years for the Chavez family as 
they joined the thousands of displaced 
people who were forced to migrate 
throughout the country to labor in the 
fields and vineyards. 

Motivated by the poverty and harsh 
working conditions, he began to follow 
his dream of establishing an organization 
dedicated to helping these farm 
workers. In 1962 he founded the National 
Farm Workers Association 
which would eventually evolve into the 
United Farm Workers of America. 

Over the next three decades with an 
unwavering commitment to democratic 
principals and a philosophy of 
non-violence he struggled to secure a 
living wage, health benefits and safe 
working conditions for arguably the 
most exploited work force in our country, 
that they might enjoy the basic 
protections and worker’s right to 
which all Americans aspire. 

In 1945, at the age of 18 Cesar Chavez 
joined the U.S. Navy and served his 
country for two years. He was the recipient 
of the Martin Luther King Jr. 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S43 

Peace Prize as well as the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom, the highest award 
this country can bestow upon a civilian. 


Chavez’s efforts brought dignity and 
respect to this country’s farm workers 
and in doing so became a hero, role 
model and inspiration to people engaged 
in human rights struggles 
throughout the world. 

The naming of this building will keep 
alive the memory of his sacrifice and 
commitment for the millions of people 
whose lives he touched. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of the bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was

S. 30 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 

SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF CESAR E. CHAVEZ 
MEMORIAL BUILDING. 

The building known as the ‘‘Colonnade 
Center’’, located at 1244 Speer Boulevard in 
Denver, Colorado, shall be known and designated 
as the ‘‘Cesar E. Chavez Memorial 
Building’’. 
SEC. 2. REFERENCES. 

Any reference in a law, map, regulation, 
document, paper, or other record of the 
United States to the building referred to in

By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, 
Ms. COLLINS, and Mr. KOHL): 

S. 36. A bill to amend title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act to eliminate 
the geographic physician work adjustment 
factor from the geographic indices 
used to adjust payments under the 
physician fee schedule, to provide incentives 
necessary to attract educators 
and clinical practitioners to under-
served areas, and to revise the area 
wage adjustment applicable under the 
prospective payment system for skilled 
nursing facilities; to the Committee on 
Finance. 
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join with my colleagues from 
Maine to introduce legislation to restore 
fairness to the Medicare program. 
This package of legislation will reduce 
regional inequalities in Medicare 
spending and support providers of high-
quality, low-cost Medicare services. 

The high cost of health care in Wisconsin 
is skyrocketing: A survey issued 
a few days ago found that the cost of 
health care benefits for employees in 
this State rose 14.8 percent this year, 
to an average of $6,940 per employee. 
That’s 20 percent high than the national 
average of $5,758 for workers in 
businesses with 500 or more employees. 

These costs are hitting our State 
hard, they are burdening businesses 
and employees, hurting health care 
providers, and preventing seniors from 
getting full access to the care that 
they deserve. 

One of the major contributing factors 
to the high cost in our state is the inherent 
unfairness of the Medicare Program. 


With the guidance and support of 
people across our State who are fighting 
for Medicare fairness. I have proposed 
this legislation to address Medicare’s 
discrimination against Wisconsin’s 
seniors, employers and health 
care providers. The Medicare program 
should encourage the kind of high-
quality, cost-effective Medicare services 
that we have in Wisconsin. But as 
many in Wisconsin know, that’s not 
the case. 

To give an idea of how inequitable 
the distribution of Medicare dollars is, 
imagine identical twins over the age of 

65. Both twins worked at the same 
company all their lives, at the same 
salary, and paid the same amount to 
the Federal Government in payroll 
taxes, the tax that goes into the Medicare 
Trust Fund. 
But if one twin retired to New Orleans, 
Louisiana, and the other retired to 
Eau Claire, Wisconsin, they would have 
vastly different health options under 
the Medicare system. The twin in Louisiana 
would get much more. 

For example, in most parts of Louisiana, 
the first twin would have more 
options under Medicare. The high 
Medicare payments in those areas 
allow Medicare beneficiaries to choose 
between an HMO or traditional fee-forservice 
plan, and, because area health 
care providers are reimbursed at such a 
high rate, those providers can afford to 
offer seniors a broad range of health 
care services. The twin in Eau Claire 
does not have the same access to care, 
there are no options to choose from in 
terms of Medicare HMOs, and sometimes 
fewer health care agencies that 
can afford to provide care under the 
traditional fee-for-service plan. 

How can two people with identical 
backgrounds, who paid the same 
amount in payroll taxes, have such different 
options under Medicare? They 
can because the distribution of Medicare 
dollars among the 50 States is 
grossly unfair to Wisconsin, and much 
of the Upper Midwest. Wisconsinites 
pay payroll taxes just like every American 
taxpayer, but the Medicare funds 
we get in return are lower than those 
received in many other states. 

My legislation will take us a step in 
the right direction by reducing the inequities 
in Medicare payments to Wisconsin’s 
hospitals, physicians, and 
skilled nursing facilities. 

Last year, with the introduction my 
Medicare fairness legislation along 
with the efforts of many other Senators, 
we put Medicare fairness issues 
front and center in Congress. The Senate 
Budget Committee approved my 
amendment to promote Medicare fairness 
in any Medicare reform package. 
A wide range of Senators from both 
parties endorsed my proposal to create 
a Medicare fairness coalition. The 
House passed a number of Medicare 
fairness provisions that were a result 
of these successes, and both House and 
Senate leadership endorsed Medicare 
fairness issues. Now that we have finally 
brought these issues the atten


tion that they deserve, we need to 
build on that momentum to pass Medicare 
fairness provisions into law. 

My legislation demands Medicare 
fairness for Wisconsin and other affected 
States, plain and simple. Medicare 
shouldn’t penalize high-quality 
providers of Medicare services, most of 
all. Medicare should stop penalizing 
seniors who depend on the program for 
their health care. They have worked 
had and paid into the program all their 
lives, and in return they deserve full 
access to the wide range of benefits 
that Medicare has to offer. 

I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to move this legislation forward. 
I believe that we can re-balance 
the budget, while at the same time encouraging 
efficient, quality enhancing 
services, and that’s what my legislation 
sets out to do. 

By Mr. MCCONNELL (for himself 
and Mr. BUNNING): 

S. 37. A bill to amend title II of the 
Social Security Act to permit Kentucky 
to operate a separate retirement 
system for certain public employees; to 
the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce legislation to 
add Kentucky to the list of States that 
are permitted to offer ‘‘divided retirement’’ 
plans under the Social Security 
Act. 

Last year, I was contacted by Brian 
James, President of the Louisville Fraternal 
Order of Police, FOP, and Tony 
Cobaugh, President of the Jefferson 
County FOP. These two law enforcement 
leaders called my attention to a 
problem that could jeopardize the retirement 
security of many of our community’s 
police, fire, and emergency 
personnel. 

In November of 2000, the citizens of 
Jefferson County and the City of Louisville, 
Kentucky voted to merge their 
communities and respective governments 
into a single entity, which will 
be known as Greater Louisville. As one 
might expect, combining two large 
metropolitan governments in such a 
short time frame cannot be done without 
encountering a few difficulties 
along the way. Jefferson County and 
the City of Louisville currently operate 
two very different retirement programs 
for their police officers. When these 
two governments merge today, current 
federal law will require the new government 
to offer a single retirement 
plan that could dramatically increase 
the cost of retirement for both our 
dedicated public safety officers and the 
new Greater Louisville government. 

Thankfully, when the FOP’s leaders 
called this problem to my attention, 
they also suggested a simple solution, 
let the police officers and firefighters 
choose for themselves the retirement 
system which best meets their needs. 

I rise today to offer legislation that 
will provide retirement stability to our 
public safety officers by allowing Kentucky 
to operate what is known as a 
‘‘divided retirement system.’’ 


S44 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

With passage of my legislation and 
legislation already passed by the Kentucky 
General Assembly, Louisville’s 
and Jefferson County’s police officers 
would decide whether or not they want 
to participate in Social Security or remain 
in their traditional retirement 
plan. While future employees will be 
automatically enrolled in Social Security, 
no current officers would be 
forced into a new retirement system as 
a result of the merger without their approval. 


Current Federal law allows twenty-
one States the option of offering divided 
retirement systems. Unfortunately, 
Kentucky is not one of these 
twenty-one states. The legislation I am 
offering today would change that by 
adding Kentucky to list of states designated 
in the Social Security Act. 

The language I introduce today was 
included in legislation, H.R. 4070, that 
passed both the House and the Senate 
in the 107th Congress. Unfortunately, 
there were differences in the House and 
Senate versions of H.R. 4070, unrelated 
to the Louisville language, that were 
resolved only shortly prior to the adjournment 
of the 107th Congress. Unfortunately, 
the 107th Congress adjourned 
sine die before this compromise 
version of H.R. 4070 could be considered 
by both bodies of Congress. 

It is critical that the Senate provide 
this retirement stability to the brave 
men and women who protect the citizens 
of Louisville and Jefferson County 
everyday. There is extensive precedent 
for granting Kentucky this authority, 
and my legislation enjoys the broad, 
bipartisan support of policemen, firefighters, 
local and state officials, and 
the Social Security Administration. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of the bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 37 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 

SECTION 1. COVERAGE UNDER DIVIDED RETIRE


MENT SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC EMPLOY


EES IN KENTUCKY. 

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 218(d)(6)(C) of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 418(d)(6)(C)) is 
amended by inserting ‘‘Kentucky,’’ after ‘‘Illinois,’’. 
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment 
made by subsection (a) takes effect on January 
1, 2003. 
By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself 
and Ms. COLLINS): 

S. 39. A bill to promote the development 
of health care cooperatives that 
will help businesses to pool the health 
care purchasing power of employers, 
and for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions. 
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise 
today with my colleague from Maine to 
introduce legislation to help businesses 
form group-purchasing cooperatives to 
obtain enhanced benefits, to reduce 

health care rates, and to improve quality 
for their employees’ health care. 

High health care costs are burdening 
businesses and employees across the 
Nation. These costs are digging into 
profits and preventing access to affordable 
health care. Too many patients 
feel trapped by the system, with decisions 
about their health dictated by 
costs rather than by what they need. 

The cost of health care in Wisconsin 
is skyrocketing: A recent survey found 
that the cost of health benefits for employees 
in Wisconsin rose 14.8 percent 
this year, to an average of $6,940 per 
employee. That’s 20 percent higher 
than the national average of $5,758 for 
workers in businesses with 500 or more 
employees. 

We must curb these rapidly-increasing 
health care premiums. I strongly 
support initiatives to ensure that everyone 
has access to health care. It is 
crucial that we support successful local 
initiatives to reduce health care premiums 
and to improve the quality of 
employees’ health care. 

By using group purchasing to obtain 
rate discounts, some employers have 
been able to reduce the cost of health 
care premiums for their employees. According 
to the National Business Coalition 
on Health, there are more than 90 
employer-led coalitions across the 
United States that collectively purchase 
health care. Through these pools, 
businesses are able to proactively challenge 
high costs and inefficient delivery 
of health care and share information 
on quality. These coalitions represent 
over 7,000 employers and approximately 
34 million employees Nationwide. 


Improving the quality of health care 
will also lower the cost of care. By investing 
in the delivery of quality 
health care, we will be able to lower 
long term health care costs. Effective 
care, such as quality preventive services, 
can reduce overall health care expenditures. 
Health purchasing coalitions 
help promote these services and 
act as an employer forum for networking 
and education on health care 
cost containment strategies. They can 
help foster a dialogue with health care 
providers, insurers, and local HMOs. 

Health care markets are local. Problems 
with cost, quality, and access to 
health care are felt most intensely in 
the local markets. Health care coalitions 
can function best when they are 
formed and implemented locally. Local 
employers of large and small businesses 
have formed health care coalitions 
to track health care trends, create 
a demand for quality and safety, 
and encourage group purchasing. 

In Wisconsin, there have been various 
successful initiatives that have formed 
health care purchasing cooperatives to 
improve quality of care and to reduce 
cost. For example, the Employer 
Health Care Alliance Cooperative, an 
employer-owned and employer-directed 
not-for-profit cooperative, has developed 
a network of health care providers 
in Dane County and 12 surrounding 

counties on behalf of its 170 member 
employers. Through this pooling effort, 
employers are able to obtain affordable, 
high-quality health care for their 
110,000 employees and dependents. 

This legislation seeks to build on 
successful local initiatives, such as the 
Alliance, that help businesses to join 
together to increase access to affordable 
and high-quality health care. 

The Promoting Health Care Purchasing 
Cooperatives Act would authorize 
grants to a group of businesses 
so that they could form group-purchasing 
cooperatives to obtain enhanced 
benefits, reduce health care 
rates, and improve quality. 

This legislation offers two separate 
grant programs to help different types 
of businesses pool their resources and 
bargaining power. Both programs 
would aid businesses to form cooperatives. 
The first program would help 
large businesses that sponsor their own 
health plans, while the second program 
would help small businesses that purchase 
their health insurance. 

My bill would enable larger businesses 
to form cost-effective cooperatives 
that could offer quality health 
care through several ways. First, they 
could obtain health services through 
pooled purchasing from physicians, 
hospitals, home health agencies, and 
others. By pooling their experience and 
interests, employers involved in a coalition 
could better attack the essential 
issues, such as rising health insurance 
rates and the lack of comparable 
health care quality data. They would 
be able to share information regarding 
the quality of these services and to 
partner with these health care providers 
to meet the needs of their employees. 


For smaller businesses that purchase 
their health insurance, the formation 
of cooperatives would allow them to 
buy health insurance at lower prices 
through pooled purchasing. 

Also, the communication within 
these cooperatives would provide employees 
of small businesses with better 
information about the health care options 
that are available to them. Finally, 
coalitions would serve to promote 
quality improvements by facilitating 
partnerships between their 
group and the health care providers. 

By working together, the group could 
develop better quality insurance plans 
and negotiate better rates. 

Past health purchasing pool initiatives 
have focused only on cost and 
have tried to be all things for all people. 
My legislation creates an incentive 
to join the pools by giving grants to a 
group of similar businesses to form 
group-purchasing cooperatives. The 
pool are also given flexibility to find 
innovative ways to lower costs, such as 
enhancing benefits, for example, more 
preventive care, and improving quality. 
Finally, the cooperative structure is a 
proven model, which creates an incentive 
for businesses to remain in the 
pool because they will be invested in 
the organization. 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S45 

We must reform health care in America 
and give employers and employees 
more options. This legislation, by providing 
for the formation of cost-effective 
coalitions that will also improve 
the quality of care, contributes to this 
essential reform process. I urge my colleagues 
to join me in cosponsoring this 
proposal to improve the quality and 
costs of health care. 

By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself 
and Mr. JEFFORDS): 

S. 40. A bill to prohibit products that 
contain dry ultra-filtered milk products 
or casein from being labeled as domestic 
natural cheese, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, 
Nutrition, and Forestry. 
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to re-introduce the Quality 
Cheese Act of 2003. This legislation will 
protect the consumer, save taxpayer 
dollars and provide support to America’s 
dairy farmers, who have taken a 
beating in the marketplace in recent 
years. 

When Wisconsin consumers have the 
choice, they will choose natural Wisconsin 
cheese. But the Food and Drug 
Administration, FDA, and the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture, USDA, may 
change current law, and consumers 
won’t know whether cheese is really all 
natural or not. 

If the Federal Government creates a 
loophole for imitation cheese ingredients 
to be used in U.S. cheese vats, 
some cheese labels saying ‘‘domestic’’ 
and ‘‘natural’’ will no longer be truly 
accurate. 

If USDA and FDA allow a change in 
Federal rules, imitation milk proteins 
known as milk protein concentrate, casein, 
or dry ultra filtered milk could be 
used to make cheese in place of the 
wholesome natural milk produced by 
cows in Wisconsin or other part of the 
U.S. 

I am deeply concerned by recent efforts 
to change America’s natural 
cheese standard. This effort to allow 
milk protein concentrate and casein 
into natural cheese products flies in 
the face of logic and could create a 
loophole that could allow unlimited 
amounts of substandard imported milk 
proteins to enter U.S. cheese vats. 

My legislation would close this loophole 
and ensure that consumers could 
be confident that they were buying 
natural cheese when they saw the natural 
label. 

Over the past decade, cheese consumption 
has risen at a strong pace 
due in part to promotional and marketing 
efforts and investments by 
dairy farmers across the country. Year 
after year, per capita cheese consumption 
has risen at a steady rate. 

Recent proposals to change to our 
natural cheese standards, however, 
could decrease consumption of natural 
cheese. These declines could result 
from concerns about the origin of casein 
and milk protein concentrate. 

The addition of this kind of milk 
could significantly tarnish the whole


some reputation of natural cheese in 
the eyes of the consumer. 

This change could seriously compromise 
decades of work by America’s 
dairy farmers to build up domestic 
cheese consumption levels. It is simply 
not fair to America’s farmers! 

Consumers have a right to know if 
the cheese that they buy is unnatural. 
And by allowing milk protein concentrate 
milk into cheese, we are denying 
consumers the entire picture. 

This legislation will require that labels 
paint the entire picture for the 
consumer, and allow them enough information 
to select cheese made from 
truly natural ingredients. 

Allowing MPCs or dry ultra-filtered 
milk into natural cheeses would also 
harm dairy producers throughout the 
United States. Some estimate that the 
annual effect of the change on the 
dairy farm sector of the economy could 
be more than $100 million. 

The proposed change to our natural 
cheese standard would also harm the 
American taxpayer. If we allow MPCs 
to be used in cheese, we will effectively 
permit unrestricted importation of 
these ingredients into the United 
States. Because there are no tariffs and 
quotas on these ingredients, these 
heavily-subsidized products would displace 
natural domestic dairy ingredients. 


These unnatural domestic dairy products 
would enter our domestic cheese 
market and might further depress 
dairy prices paid to American dairy 
producers. Low dairy prices result in 
increased costs to the dairy price support 
program. So, at the same time 
that U.S. dairy farmers would receive 
lower prices, the U.S. taxpayer would 
pay more for the dairy price support 
program. 

This change does not benefit the 
dairy farmer, consumer or taxpayer. 
Who then is it good for? 

It would benefit only unscrupulous 
foreign MPC producers out to make a 
fast buck at the expense of Americans. 

This legislation addresses the concerns 
of farmers, consumers and taxpayers 
by prohibiting dry ultra-filtered 
milk from being included in America’s 
natural cheese standard. 

Congress must shut the door on any 
backdoor efforts to stack the deck 
against America’s dairy farmers. And 
we must pass my legislation that prevents 
a loophole that would allow 
changes that hurt the consumer, taxpayer, 
and dairy farmer. 

By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself 
and Mr. DASCHLE) 

S. 41. A bill to strike certain provisions 
of the Homeland Security Act of 
2002 (Public Law 107–296), and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Governmental 
Affairs. 
Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce a bill on behalf 
of myself and Senator DASCHLE to remedy 
some problems in landmark legislation 
passed at the end of the last 
Congress, and signed into law by Presi


dent Bush, to establish a Department 
of Homeland Security. The legislation 
we are offering today would strike 
seven extraneous special interest provisions 
inserted into the Homeland Security 
Act by Republican leadership in 
the bill’s waning hours, provisions that 
are contrary to the bipartisan spirit in 
which the Homeland Security Act was 
conceived. 

Since the days following September 
11, 2001, when terrorists viciously took 
the lives of 3,000 of our friends, family 
and fellow Americans, I have advocated 
establishing a Department of Homeland 
Security to beat the terrorist 
threat. Senator ARLEN SPECTER, and I 
initially proposed creating a new department 
in October 2001. Our measure 
was not just bipartisan. It was in fact 
intended to be nonpartisan. 

Unfortunately, some partisan battles 
did ensue, primarily regarding longstanding 
civil service protections for 
homeland security workers, and I remain 
very concerned about the potential 
impact of these provisions. Nevertheless, 
the final bill was, for the most 
part, a critical, well-constructed piece 
of legislation that incorporated the 
majority of the provisions approved by 
the Governmental Affairs Committee, 
and which an overwhelming majority 
of the Senate embraced. 

In some very specific ways, however, 
the bill was flawed. In the final stages 
of passing the bill, the Republican 
leadership hastily inserted several special 
interest provisions that had no 
place in this measure. Most of these 
provisions had never been in any 
version of the legislation before the 
Senate before they were presented in a 
take-it-or-leave-it package by Republicans, 
and several had not been considered 
by either chamber. The method 
and spirit in which these provisions 
found their way into what should have 
been a consensus piece of legislation 
was utterly objectionable and Senator 
DASCHLE and I made an effort to remove 
them at the time. That effort 
narrowly failed, but not before news of 
these special interest provisions had 
created great consternation for Democrats 
and the public, and even for some 
Republicans. Indeed, according to numerous 
published reports, the Republican 
leadership was able to muster the 
votes to preserve the provisions only 
after promising to revisit at least some 
of the most egregious additions during 
this session of Congress. 

I believe that the seven extraneous 
provisions my legislation targets hurt 
the Homeland Security Act as it was finally 
passed by the Congress and 
signed by the President. And I believe 
that, by attaching these measures to 
what could have and should have been 
a common cause, the Republican leadership 
all but admitted that the provisions 
cannot withstand independent 
scrutiny. Following are the provisions 
my bill would strike. 

First, perhaps the most egregious 
add-on to the Homeland Security Act 


S46 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

was a provision that dramatically alters 
the way certain vaccine preservatives 
are treated for liability purposes 
under the law. To quickly summarize 
this very complicated issue, children 
who are hurt by childhood vaccines 
generally may not go directly to court 
to hold vaccine manufacturers liable. 
Instead, they have to go first to what’s 
called the Federal Vaccine Injury Compensation 
Program, which offers compensation 
for some of these claims. 
Parents argued, however, that the bar 
on lawsuits didn’t use to apply to 
claims regarding faulty vaccine additives. 


These seemingly arcane legal distinctions 
were particularly important to a 
large number of parents of autistic 
children who have attributed their 
children’s autism to thimerosal, a mercury-
based preservative that used to be 
in some childhood vaccines. These parents 
sued the manufacturers of both 
vaccines and thimerosal, and they had 
many lawsuits pending in the courts as 
of last Fall. 

If you are wondering what any of this 
has to do with Homeland Security, you 
are doing exactly what we all did last 
November when in the waning days of 
debate on the Homeland Security bill, 
a provision addressing this issue appeared 
for the very first time in any 
version of the bill. That provision fundamentally 
altered the way vaccine additive 
claims would be treated from 
then on. With the swoop of a pen, the 
pending additive lawsuits against both 
vaccine and additive manufacturers 
were thrown out of court and, the provision’s 
supporters alleged, sent into 
the compensation fund. 

As I said last Fall, I don’t know 
whether there is any relationship between 
thimerosal and autism. I also 
don’t know whether these cases really 
should be resolved in court or through 
the compensation fund. But I do know 
that figuring out where and how to resolve 
these claims is a very contentious, 
complex and challenging task, 
and is just one part of addressing 
broader problems with the vaccine 
compensation system. For example, 
the vaccine compensation fund’s viability 
may be affected by the addition of 
claims regarding these additives. I also 
know that it is an issue that the committees 
of jurisdiction had been struggling 
with for a long time and that 
they should have been left to resolve. 
And I certainly know that a last second 
addition to the Homeland Security 
Act was absolutely the wrong way to 
deal with this issue and the wrong bill 
to use to take so many injured parents’ 
and children’s legal rights away. Indeed, 
we know that even more now, as 
it has become clear that while the provision 
closed the courthouse door to 
autistic children, it apparently didn’t 
open the compensation fund window as 
its supporters said it would—because it 
didn’t make the changes to either the 
fund’s statute of limitations or to governing 
tax code provisions that would 
be necessary to obtain access to the 
fund for these cases. 

The bottom line is that this was a 
wrong and poorly conceived provision 
to put in the Homeland Security bill— 
something I thought even the Republican 
leadership acknowledged when 
they were forced to make promises to 
get rid of this provision in order to 
save their bill. We should scrap it now, 
and let the committee of jurisdiction 
undertake a careful review and, I hope, 
get it right this time. 

My legislation would also strike from 
the Act a measure that requires the 
Transportation Security Oversight 
Board to ratify within 90 days emergency 
security regulations issued by 
the Transportation Security Agency. If 
the oversight board does not ratify the 
regulations, they would automatically 
lapse. Despite the TSA having decided 
that they are necessary, 90 days later, 
lacking the board’s approval, they’d 
disappear. 

This doesn’t make any sense. In the 
current climate, shouldn’t we be trying 
to find new ways to expedite and implement 
TSA rules, not always to disrupt 
and derail them? This provision is contrary 
to new procedures that the Senate 
passed in 2001 in the aviation security 
bill. Under that law, regulations 
go into effect and remain in effect unless 
they are affirmatively disapproved 
by the Board. I think that’s a better 
system. 

Another provision would extend liability 
protection to companies that 
provided passenger and baggage screening 
in airports on September 11. 

But we in the Senate decided against 
extending such liability protection in 
at least two different contexts. First, 
the airline bailout bill limited the liability 
of the airlines, but not of the 
security screeners, due to ongoing concerns 
about their role leading up to 
September 11. Then, the conference report 
on the Transportation Security 
bill extended the liability limitations 
to others who might have been the target 
of lawsuits, such as aircraft manufacturers 
and airport operators, but 
again not to the baggage and passenger 
screeners. 

Like that little mole you hit with 
the mallet in a whack-a-mole game, 
somehow this provision reappeared in 
the Homeland Security Act. We must 
strike it. 

Another unnecessary and overreaching 
provision I seek to strike 
gives the Secretary of the new department 
broad authority to designate certain 
technologies as so-called ‘‘qualified 
antiterrorism technologies.’’ His 
granting of this designation, which appears 
to be unilateral, and probably 
not subject to review by anyone, would 
entitle companies selling that technology 
to broad liability protection 
from any claim arising out of, relating 
to, or resulting from an act of terrorism, 
no matter how negligently, or 
even wantonly and willfully, the company 
acted. 

This provision seems to say that in 
many cases, the plaintiff can’t recover 
anything from the seller unless an in


jured plaintiff can prove that the seller 
of the product that injured him or her 
acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct 
in submitting information to 
the Secretary when the Secretary was 
deciding whether to certify the product. 


Even in cases where a seller isn’t entitled 
to the benefit of that protection, 
the company still isn’t fully, or in 
many cases even partially, responsible 
for its actions, even if it knew there 
was something terribly wrong with its 
product. Perhaps worst of all, this 
measure caps the seller’s liability at 
the limits of its insurance policy. In 
other words, if injured people were 
lucky enough to get through the first 
hurdle and even hold a faulty seller liable, 
they still could go completely uncompensated 
even if a liable seller has 
more than enough money to compensate 
them. 

The Homeland Security Act unwisely 
and unnecessarily allows the Secretary 
to exempt the new department’s advisory 
committees from the open meetings 
requirements and other requirements 
of the Federal Advisory Committee 
Act, FACA. 

Agencies throughout government 
make use of advisory committees that 
function under these open meetings requirements. 
Existing law is careful to 
protect discussions and documents that 
involve sensitive information, in fact, 
the FACA law currently applies successfully 
to the Department of Defense, 
the Department of Justice, the State 
Department, even the secretive National 
Security Agency. 

So why should the Department of 
Homeland Security be allowed to exempt 
its advisory committees from its 
requirements? Why should its advisory 
committees be allowed to meet in total 
secret with no public knowledge? 

We all say that we’re for ‘‘good government,’’ 
for openness, integrity, and 
accountability. But as it now stands, 
few of us will be able to say with confidence 
that the new department’s advisory 
committees are designed to be 
as independent, balanced, and transparent 
as possible. I know full well 
that the Homeland Security Department 
will deal with sensitive information 
involving life and death, but so 
does the National Security Agency. So 
does the FBI. So does the Department 
of Defense. Their advisory committees 
aren’t allowed to hide themselves away 
from the public. 

Finally, our legislation would alter a 
provision in the Act creating a university-
based homeland security research 
center. Now, I have nothing against 
creating a university research center 
focused on homeland security. 

But there’s a problem with this particular 
provision as it is written. The 
research center that it would create is 
described so narrowly, through 15 specific 
criteria, that it appears Texas 
A&M University has the inside track, 
to say the least, to get the funding and 
house the center. 

Science in this country has thrived 
over the years because, by and large, 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S47 

Congress has refused to intervene in 
science decisions. Science has thrived 
through peer review and competition 
over the best proposals—which are fundamentals 
of federal science policy. We 
are violating them here. This is nothing 
short of ‘‘science pork.’’ 

When it comes to making these research 
funding decisions, we need a 
playing field that’s truly level, not one 
that only looks level when you tilt 
your head. 

Our legislation keeps the university-
based science center program. However, 
it removes the highly-specific criteria 
that appear to direct it to a particular 
university. That’s the way we’ll 
get the best science, not by making 
Congressional allocations to particular 
institutions. 

I’m extremely pleased we have created 
a Department of Homeland Security 
and plan to do everything I can to 
help ensure its success. But these flaws 
are real. They are serious. And they 
are utterly unnecessary. I ask unanimous 
consent that the text of the bill 
be printed in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 41

By Mr. FEINGOLD: 

S. 42. A bill to amend the Agricultural 
Adjustment Act to prohibit the 
Secretary of Agriculture from basing 
minimum prices for Class I milk on the 
distance or transportation costs from 
any location that is not within a marketing 
area, except under certain circumstances, 
and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, 
and Forestry. 
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise 
today to offer a measure which could 
serve as a first step towards eliminating 
the inequities borne by the 
dairy farmers of Wisconsin and the 
upper Midwest under the Federal Milk 
Marketing Order system. 

The Federal Milk Marketing Order 
system, created nearly 60 years ago, establishes 
minimum prices for milk paid 
to producers throughout various marketing 
areas in the U.S. For sixty 
years, this system has discriminated 
against producers in the Upper Midwest 
by awarding a higher price to 
dairy farmers in proportion to the distance 
of their farms from Eau Claire, 
Wisconsin. 

My legislation is very simple. It identifies 
the single most harmful and unjust 
feature of the current system, and 
corrects it. Under the current archaic 
law, the price for fluid milk increases 
depending on the distance from Eau 
Claire, Wisconsin, even though most 
local milk markets do not receive any 
milk from Wisconsin. 

The bill I introduce today would prohibit 
the Secretary of Agriculture from 
using distance or transportation costs 
from any location as the basis for pricing 
milk, unless significant quantities 
of milk are actually transported from 
that location into the recipient market. 
The Secretary will have to comply 
with the statutory requirement that 
supply and demand factors be considered 
as specified in the Agricultural 
Marketing Agreement Act when setting 
milk prices in marketing orders. 
The fact remains that single-basingpoint 
pricing simply cannot be justified 
based on supply and demand for 
milk both in local and national markets. 


This bill also requires the Secretary 
to report to Congress on specifically 
which criteria are used to set milk 
prices. Finally, the Secretary will have 
to certify to Congress that the criteria 
used by the Department do not in any 
way attempt to circumvent the prohibition 
on using distance or transportation 
cost as basis for pricing milk. 

This one change is so crucial to 
Upper Midwest producers, because the 
current system has penalized them for 
many years. The current system provides 
disparate profits for producers in 
other parts of the country and creating 
artificial economic incentives for milk 
production. As a result, Wisconsin producers 
have seen national surpluses 

rise, and milk prices fall. Rather than 
providing adequate supplies of fluid 
milk, the prices have led to excess production. 


The prices have provided production 
incentives beyond those needed to ensure 
a local supply of fluid milk in 
some regions, leading to an increase in 
manufactured products in those marketing 
orders. Those manufactured 
products directly compete with Wisconsin’s 
processed products, eroding 
our markets and driving national 
prices down. 

The perverse nature of this system is 
further illustrated by the fact that 
since 1995 some regions of the U.S., notably 
the Central states and the Southwest, 
are producing so much milk that 
they are actually shipping fluid milk 
north to the Upper Midwest. The high 
fluid milk prices have generated so 
much excess production, that these 
markets distant from Eau Claire are 
now encroaching upon not only our 
manufactured markets, but also our 
markets for fluid milk, further eroding 
prices in Wisconsin. 

The market-distorting effects of the 
fluid price differentials in Federal orders 
are manifest in the Congressional 
Budget Office estimate that eliminating 
the orders would save $669 million 
over five years. Government outlays 
would fall, CBO concludes, because 
production would fall in response to 
lower milk prices and there would be 
fewer government purchases of surplus 
milk. The regions that would gain and 
lose in this scenario illustrate the discrimination 
inherent to the current 
system. Economic analyses show that 
farm revenues in a market undisturbed 
by Federal orders would actually increase 
in the Upper Midwest and fall in 
most other milk-producing regions. 

While this system has been around 
since 1937, the practice of basing fluid 
milk price differentials on the distance 
from Eau Claire was formalized in the 
1960’s, when the Upper Midwest arguably 
was the primary reserve for additional 
supplies of milk. The idea was to 
encourage local supplies of fluid milk 
in areas of the country that did not 
traditionally produce enough fluid 
milk to meet their own needs. 

That is no longer the case. The Upper 
Midwest is not the primary source of 
reserve supplies of milk. Unfortunately, 
the prices didn’t adjust with 
changing economic conditions, most 
notably the shift of the dairy industry 
away from the Upper Midwest and towards 
the Southwest, and specifically 
California, which now leads the Nation 
in milk production. 

The result of this antiquated system 
has been a decline in the Upper Midwest 
dairy industry, not because it 
can’t produce a product that can compete 
in the market place, but because 
the system discriminates against it. 
Today, Wisconsin loses dairy farmers 
at a rate of more than 5 per day. The 
Upper Midwest, with the lowest fluid 
milk prices, is shrinking as a dairy region 
despite the dairy-friendly climate 


S48 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

of the region. Other regions with higher 
fluid milk prices are growing rapidly. 


In an free market with a level playing 
field, these shifts in production 
might be fair. But in a market where 
the government is setting the prices 
and providing that artificial advantage 
to regions outside the Upper Midwest, 
the current system is unconscionable. 

I urge my colleagues to do the right 
thing and bring reform to this out 
dated system and work to eliminate 
the inequities in the current milk marketing 
order pricing system. 

By Mr. FEINGOLD: 

S. 43. A bill to allow modified bloc 
voting by cooperative associations of 
milk producers in connection with a 
referendum on Federal Milk Marketing 
Order reform; to the Committee on Agriculture, 
Nutrition and Forestry. 
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise 
to re-introduce a measure that will 
begin to restore democracy for dairy 
farmers throughout the Nation. 

When dairy farmers across the country 
voted on a referendum four years 
ago, perhaps the most significant 
change in dairy policy in sixty years, 
they didn’t actually get to vote. Instead, 
their dairy marketing cooperatives 
cast their votes for them. 

This procedure is called ‘‘bloc voting’’ 
and it is used all the time. Basically, 
a Cooperative’s Board of Directors 
decides that, in the interest of 
time, bloc voting will be implemented 
for that particular vote. It may serve 
the interest of time, but not always in 
the interest of their producer owner-
members. 

I do think that bloc voting can be a 
useful tool in some circumstances, but 
I have serious concerns about its use in 
every circumstance. Farmers in Wisconsin 
and in other states tell me that 
they do not agree with their Cooperative’s 
view on every vote. Yet, they 
have no way to preserve their right to 
make their single vote count. 

After speaking to farmers and officials 
at USDA, I have learned that if a 
Cooperative bloc votes, individual 
members simply have no opportunity 
to voice opinions separately. That 
seems unfair when you consider what 
significant issues may be at stake. 
Coops and their members do not always 
have identical interests. We shouldn’t 
ask farmers to ignore that fact. 

The Democracy for Dairy Producers 
Act of 2003 is simple and fair. It provides 
that a cooperative cannot deny 
any of its members a ballot if one or 
two or ten or all of the members chose 
to vote on their own. 

This will in no way slow down the 
process at USDA; implementation of 
any rule or regulation would proceed 
on schedule. Also, I do not expect that 
this would often change the final outcome 
of any given vote. Coops could 
still cast votes for their members who 
do not exercise their right to vote individually. 
And to the extent that coops 
represent farmers interest, farmers are 

likely to vote along with the coops, but 
whether they join the coops or not, 
farmers deserve the right to vote according 
to their own views. 

I urge my colleagues to return the 
democratic process to America’s farmers, 
by supporting the Democracy for 
Dairy Producers Act. 

By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself 
and Ms. CANTWELL): 

S. 44. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the percentage 
depletion allowance for certain 
hardrock mines, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today 
I am reintroducing legislation to eliminate 
from the Federal Tax Code percentage 
depletion allowances for 
hardrock minerals mined on Federal 
public lands. I am pleased that the Senator 
from Washington, Ms. CANTWELL, 
is joining me as an original cosponsor. 

President Clinton proposed the elimination 
of the percentage depletion allowance 
on public lands in his FY 2001 
budget. President Clinton’s FY 2001 
budget estimated that, under this legislation, 
income to the Federal treasury 
from the elimination of percentage 
depletion allowances for hardrock mining 
on public lands would total $487 
million over 5 years and $1.20 billion 
over 10 years. The Joint Committee on 
Taxation estimated that it would save 
$410 million over 5 years and $823 million 
over 10 years. These savings are 
calculated as the excess amount of 
Federal revenues above what would be 
collected if depletion allowances were 
limited to sunk costs in capital investments. 
Percentage depletion allowances 
are contained in the tax code for 
extracted fuel, minerals, metal and 
other mined commodities. These allowances 
have a combined value, according 
to estimates by the Joint Committee 
on Taxation, of $4.8 billion. 

These percentage depletion allowances 
were initiated by the Corporation 
Excise Act of 1909. That’s right, 
these allowances were initiated nearly 
one hundred years ago. Provisions for a 
depletion allowance based on the value 
of the mine were made under a 1912 
Treasury Department regulation, but 
difficulty in applying this accounting 
principle to mineral production led to 
the initial codification of the mineral 
depletion allowance in the Tariff Act of 
1913. The Revenue Act of 1926 established 
percentage depletion much in its 
present form for oil and gas. The percentage 
depletion allowance was then 
extended to metal mines, coal, and 
other hardrock minerals by the Revenue 
Act of 1932, and has been adjusted 
several times since. 

Percentage depletion allowances 
were historically placed in the Tax 
Code to reduce the effective tax rates 
in the mineral and extraction industries 
far below tax rates on other industries, 
providing incentives to increase 
investment, exploration and 
output. Percentage depletion also 
makes it possible, however, to recover 

many times the amount of the original 
investment. 

There are two methods of calculating 
a deduction to allow a firm to recover 
the costs of its capital investment: cost 
depletion, and percentage depletion. 
Cost depletion allows for the recovery 
of the actual capital investment, the 
costs of discovering, purchasing, and 
developing a mineral reserve, over the 
period during which the reserve produces 
income. Using cost depletion, a 
company would deduct a portion of its 
original capital investment minus any 
previous deductions, in an amount that 
is equal to the fraction of the remaining 
recoverable reserves. Under this 
method, the total deductions cannot 
exceed the original capital investment. 

Under percentage depletion, however, 
the deduction for recovery of a company’s 
investment is a fixed percentage 
of ‘‘gross income,’’ namely, sales rev-
enue—from the sale of the mineral. 
Under this method, total deductions 
typically exceed, let me be clear on 
that point, exceed the capital that the 
company invested. 

The rates for percentage depletion 
are quite significant. Section 613 of the 

U.S. Code contains depletion allowances 
for more than 70 metals and minerals, 
at rates ranging from 10 to 22 
percent. 
In addition to repealing the percentage 
depletion allowances for minerals 
mined on public lands, my bill would 
also create a new fund, called the 
Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. 
One fourth of the revenue raised by the 
bill, or approximately $120 million dollars, 
would be deposited into an interest 
bearing fund in the Treasury to be 
used to clean up abandoned hardrock 
mines in states that are subject to the 
1872 Mining Law. The Mineral Policy 
Center estimates that there are 557,650 
abandoned hardrock mine sites nationwide 
and the cost of clearing them up 
will range from $32.7 billion to $71.5 billion. 


There are currently no comprehensive 
Federal or State programs to address 
the need to clean up old mine 
sites. Reclaiming these sites requires 
the enactment of a program with explicit 
authority to clean up abandoned 
mine sites and the resources to do it. 
My legislation is a first step toward 
providing the needed authority and resources. 


In today’s budget climate we are 
faced with the question of who should 
bear the costs of exploration, development, 
and production of natural resources: 
all taxpayers, or the users and 
producers of the resource? For more 
than a century, the mining industry 
has been paying next to nothing for the 
privilege of extracting minerals from 
public lands and then abandoning its 
mines. Now those mines are adding to 
the nation’s environmental and financial 
burdens. We face serious budget 
choices this fiscal year, yet these subsidies 
remain persistent tax expenditures 
that raise the deficit for all citizens 
or shift a greater tax burden to 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S49 

other taxpayers to compensate for the 
special tax breaks provided to the mining 
industry. 

The measure I am introducing is fairly 
straightforward. It eliminates the 
percentage depletion allowance for 
hardrock minerals mined on public 
lands while continuing to allow companies 
to recover reasonable cost depletion. 


Though at one time, there may have 
been an appropriate role for a government-
driven incentive for enhanced 
mineral production, there is now sufficient 
reason to adopt a more reasonable 
depletion allowance that is consistent 
with depreciation rates given to 
other businesses. 

The time has come for the Federal 
Government to get out of the business 
of subsidizing one business over another. 
We can no longer afford its costs 
in dollars or its cost to the health of 
our citizens. This legislation is one 
step toward the goal of ending these 
corporate welfare subsidies. 

I ask unanimous consent the text of 
the legislation be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 44 

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Elimination 
of Double Subsidies for the Hardrock Mining 
Industry Act of 2003’’. 

SEC. 2. REPEAL OF PERCENTAGE DEPLETION AL


LOWANCE FOR CERTAIN HARDROCK 

MINES. 

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 613(a) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to percentage 
depletion) is amended by inserting 
‘‘(other than hardrock mines located on 
lands subject to the general mining laws or 
on land patented under the general mining 
laws)’’ after ‘‘In the case of the mines’’. 
(b) GENERAL MINING LAWS DEFINED.—Section 
613 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
is amended by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(f) GENERAL MINING LAWS.—For purposes 
of subsection (a), the term ‘‘general mining 
laws’’ means those Acts which generally 
comprise chapters 2, 12A, and 16, and sections

By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself 
and Ms. COLLINS): 

S. 45. A bill to make changes to the 
Office for State and Local Government 
Coordination, Department of Homeland 
Security; to the Committee on Governmental 
Affairs. 
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President I rise 
today with my colleague from Maine to 
introduce legislation to help first responders 
do what they do so well, protect 
our communities in an emergency. 

The Department of Homeland Security 
will create a massive shift in the 
Federal Government. Nobody will feel 
the impact of this shift more than the 
brave men and women who work in law 
enforcement, as firefighters, as rescue 
workers, as emergency medical service 
providers, and in capacities as first responders. 


We must make sure that these first 
responders have the resources that 
they need. 

While I commend the Administration 
for raising the funding dedicated to 
first responders in the President’s 
budget, I am concerned that new layers 
of bureaucracy and reorganization 
could reduce these funding levels, or 
just as harmful, put up barriers to first 
responders actually receiving these 
funds. 

The Federal agencies in the proposed 
Department of Homeland Security 
must listen to the priorities of our 
communities. After all, the needs of 
first responders vary between regions, 
as well as between rural and urban 
communities. In Wisconsin, I have 
heard needs ranging from training to 
equipment to more emergency personnel 
in the field, just to name a few. 

My legislation would promote effective 
coordination among Federal agen


cies under the Department of Homeland 
Security and ensure that our first 
responders, our firefighters, law enforcement, 
rescue, and EMS providers, 
can help Federal agencies and the new 
Department of Homeland Security to 
improve existing programs and future 
initiatives. 

It would first establish a Federal Liaison 
on Homeland Security in each 
state and coordinate between the Department 
of Homeland Security and 
state and local first responders. 

This office would serve not only as an 
avenue to exchange ideas, but also as a 
resource to ensure that the funding and 
programs are effective. 

For example, my hope is that the 
Homeland Security Department will 
make programs such as the Fire Act a 
high priority. The Fire Act provides 
grants directly to fire departments 
across our nation for training and 
equipment needs. I recently visited one 
excellent example of this program in 
West Allis, Wisconsin, where the Department 
received a grant in 2001 to 
implement a wellness and fitness program 
for their firefighters. I am told 
that it is one of the first departments 
in the State to meet the goals of this 
program, and I commend the department 
for its efforts. 

My legislation would also direct the 
agencies within the Department of 
Homeland Security to coordinate and 
prioritize their activities that support 
first responders, and at the same time, 
ensure effective use of taxpayer dollars. 


As part of this coordination, the 
First Responders Support Act establishes 
a new advisory committee of 
those in the first responder community 
to identify and streamline effective 
programs. 

Last year, both the original Senate 
and House homeland security bills 
lacked the provisions needed to ensure 
that the new Department of Homeland 
Security communicates and coordinates 
effectively with first responders. 

During the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee mark-up of the Homeland 
Security bill, the Committee 
added our First Responders Support 
Act to the legislation. They did so 
knowing that we would have to reconcile 
the overlap between our legislation 
and the language in the Chairman’s 
mark creating an office for state 
and local government coordination. 
Our amendment, which was approved 
by the full Senate, did just that. Unfortunately, 
our proposal was dropped 
from the final bill during backroom negotiations. 


Because of this omission, I promised 
to make enacting this legislation one 
of our top priorities this Congress. 
That’s why we are re-introducing this 
legislation today. 

We must be aggressive in seeking the 
advice of our first responders, and helping 
them get the resources that they 
need to provide effective services. They 
are on the front lines, and deserve our 
strong support. 


S50 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

In almost any disaster, the local first 
responders and health care providers 
play an indispensable role. If the Department 
of Homeland Security is to 
be effective, we need to ensure that the 
resources are delivered to the front line 
personnel in an effective and coordinated 
manner. I urge my colleagues to 
join me in cosponsoring this proposal 
and support our first responders. 

By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, 
Mr. KOHL, and Mr. WYDEN): 

S. 47. A bill to terminate operation of 
the Extremely Low Frequency Communication 
System of the Navy; to the 
Committee on Armed Services. 
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today 
I am reintroducing legislation that 
would terminate the operation of the 
Navy’s Extremely Low Frequency communications 
system, Project ELF, 
which is located in Clam Lake, WI, and 
Republic, MI. 

I would like to thank the senior Senator 
from Wisconsin, Mr. KOHL, and the 
Senator from Oregon, Mr. WYDEN, for 
cosponsoring this bill. 

Project ELF is a Cold War relic that 
was designed to send short one-way 
messages to ballistic and attack submarines 
that are submerged in deep 
waters. The bill that I am introducing 
today would terminate operations at 
Project ELF, while maintaining the infrastructure 
in Wisconsin and Michigan 
in the event that a resumption in operations 
becomes necessary. 

Project ELF is ineffective and unnecessary 
in the post-Cold War era. This 
antiquated system does not facilitate 
the rapid mobilization that our military 
says it needs to respond to current 
threats from weapons of mass destruction. 
The horrific attacks of September 
11, 2001, emphasized the need for rapid, 
reliable two-way communications. 
Since ELF cannot transmit detailed 
messages, it serves as an expensive 
‘‘beeper’’ system to tell submarines to 
come to the surface to receive messages 
from other sources, and the subs 
cannot send a return message to ELF 
in the event of an emergency. It takes 
ELF four minutes to send a three-letter 
message to a deeply submerged submarine. 


With the end of the Cold War, Project 
ELF becomes harder and harder to justify. 
Our submarines no longer need to 
take that extra precaution against Soviet 
nuclear forces. They can now surface 
on a regular basis with less danger 
of detection or attack. They can also 
receive more complicated messages 
through very low frequency, VLF, 
radio waves or lengthier messages 
through satellite systems. Taxpayers 
should not be asked to continue to pay 
for what amounts to a beeper system 
that tells our submarines to come to 
the surface to receive orders from another, 
more sophisticated source. 

Further, continued operation of this 
facility is opposed by most residents in 
my state. The members of the Wisconsin 
delegation have fought hard for 
years to close down Project ELF. I 

have introduced legislation during 
each Congress since taking office in 
1993 to terminate it, and I have recommended 
it for closure to the Base 
Realignment and Closure Commission. 

Project ELF has had a turbulent history. 
Since the idea for ELF was first 
proposed in 1958, the project has been 
changed or canceled several times. 
Residents of Wisconsin have opposed 
ELF since its inception, but for years 
we were told that the national security 
considerations of the Cold War outweighed 
our concerns about this installation 
in our State. Ironically, this system 
became fully operational in 1989, 
the same year the tide of democracy 
began to sweep across Eastern Europe 
and the Soviet Union. Now, fourteen 
years later, the hammer and sickle has 
fallen and the Russian submarine fleet 
is in disarray. But Project ELF still remains 
as a constant, expensive reminder 
to the people of my State that 
many at the Department of Defense remain 
focused on the past. 

There also continue to be a number 
of public health and environmental 
concerns associated with Project ELF. 
For almost two decades, we have received 
inconclusive data on this 
project’s effects on Wisconsin and 
Michigan residents. In 1984, a U.S. District 
Court ordered that ELF be shut 
down because the Navy paid inadequate 
attention to the system’s possible 
health effects and violated the National 
Environmental Policy Act. Interestingly, 
that decision was overturned 
because U.S. national security, 
at the time, prevailed over public 
health and environmental concerns. 

Numerous medical studies point to a 
possible link between exposure to extremely 
low frequency electromagnetic 
fields and a variety of human health effects 
and abnormalities in both animal 
and plant species. 

In 1999, after six years of research, 
the National Institute of Environmental 
Health Sciences released a report 
that did not prove conclusively a 
link between electromagnetic fields 
and cancer, but the report did not disprove 
it, either. Serious questions remain, 
and many of my constituents are 
rightly concerned about this issue. 

In addition, I have heard from a number 
of dairy farmers who are convinced 
that the stray voltage associated with 
ELF transmitters has demonstrably reduced 
milk production. As we continue 
our efforts to return to a sustainable 
balanced federal budget, and as the Department 
of Defense continues to 
struggle to address readiness and other 
concerns, it is clear that outdated programs 
such as Project ELF should be 
closed down. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of this bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 47 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 

SECTION 1. TERMINATION OF OPERATION OF EX


TREMELY LOW FREQUENCY COMMU


NICATION SYSTEM. 

(a) TERMINATION REQUIRED.—The Secretary 
of the Navy shall terminate the operation of 
the Extremely Low Frequency Communication 
System of the Navy. 
(b) MAINTENANCE OF INFRASTRUCTURE.—The 
Secretary shall maintain the infrastructure 
necessary for resuming operation of the Extremely 
Low Frequency Communication 
System. 
By Mr. FEINGOLD: 

S. 48. A bill to repeal the provisions 
of law that provides automatic pay adjustments 
for Members of Congress; to 
the Committee on Governmental Affairs 
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to reintroduce legislation that 
would put an end to automatic cost-ofliving 
adjustments for Congressional 
pay. 

As my Colleagues are aware, it is an 
unusual thing to have the power to 
raise our own pay. Few people have 
that ability. Most of our constituents 
do not have that power. And that this 
power is so unusual is good reason for 
the Congress to exercise that power 
openly, and to exercise it subject to 
regular procedures that include debate, 
amendment, and a vote on the record. 

Regrettably, current law permits 
Members to avoid such an open procedure. 
All that is necessary for Congress 
to get a pay raise is that nothing be 
done to stop it. Unless Congress affirmatively 
acts, the annual pay raise takes 
effect. 

This stealth pay raise technique 
began with a change Congress enacted 
in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. In 
section 704 of that Act, Members of 
Congress voted to make themselves entitled 
to an annual raise equal to half 
a percentage point less than the employment 
cost index, one measure of 
inflation. 

On occasion, Congress has voted to 
deny itself the raise. Traditionally, 
this has been done on the Treasury-
Postal appropriations bill. But that vehicle 
is not always made available to 
those who want a public debate and 
vote on the matter. In one instance, 
the Treasury-Postal bill was slipped 
into the conference report on the Legislative 
Branch appropriations bill, and 
thus completely shielded from amendment. 
And during 2002, the Senate did 
not consider the Treasury-Postal bill 
at all. 

This makes getting a vote on the annual 
congressional pay raise a haphazard 
affair at best. And it should not 
be that way. No one should have to 
force a debate and public vote on the 
pay raise. On the contrary, Congress 
should have to act if it decides to 
award itself a hike in pay. This process 
of pay raises without accountability 
must end. 

The question of how and whether 
Members of Congress can raise their 
own pay was one that our Founders 
considered from the beginning of our 
Nation. In August of 1789, as part of the 
package of 12 amendments advocated 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S51 

by James Madison that included what 
has become our Bill of Rights, the 
House of Representatives passed an 
amendment to the Constitution providing 
that Congress could not raise its 
pay without an intervening election. 
Almost 214 years ago, on September 9, 
1789, the Senate passed that amendment. 
In late September of 1789, Congress 
submitted the amendments to the 
States. 

Although the amendment on pay 
raises languished for two centuries, in 
the 1980s, a campaign began to ratify 
it. While I was a member of the Wisconsin 
State Senate, I was proud to 
help ratify the amendment. Its approval 
by the Michigan legislature on 
May 7, 1992, gave it the needed approval 
by three-fourths of the States. 

The 27th Amendment to the Constitution 
now states: ‘No law, varying 
the compensation for the services of 
the senators and representatives, shall 
take effect, until an election of representatives 
shall have intervened.’’ 

I try to honor that limitation in my 
own practices. In my own case, 
throughout my 6-year term, I accept 
only the rate of pay that Senators receive 
on the date on which I was sworn 
in as a Senator. And I return to the 
Treasury any additional income Senators 
get, whether from a cost-of-living 
adjustment or a pay raise we vote for 
ourselves. I don’t take a raise until my 
bosses, the people of Wisconsin, give 
me one at the ballot box. That is the 
spirit of the 27th Amendment. The 
stealth pay raises like the one that 
Congress allowed last year, at a minimum, 
certainly violate the spirit of 
that amendment. 

This practice must end. To address 
it, I am reintroducing this bill to end 
the automatic cost-of-living adjustment 
for Congressional pay. Senators 
and Congressmen should have to vote 
up-or-down to raise Congressional pay. 
My bill would simply require us to vote 
in the open. We owe our constituents 
no less. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of the bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 48 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in

(3) by striking ‘‘as adjusted by paragraph

(c) EFFECTIVE DATE.—This section shall 
take effect on February 1, 2005. 
By Mr. FEINGOLD: 

S. 49. A bill to reduce the deficit of 
the United States; to the Committee 
on Energy and Natural Resources. 
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today 
I am introducing a measure aimed at 
curbing wasteful spending. In the face 
of our return to Federal deficits, we 
must prioritize and eliminate programs 
that can no longer be sustained with 
limited Federal dollars, or where a 
more cost-effective means of fulfilling 
those functions can be substituted. The 
measure that I introduce today eliminates 
or modifies three Federal programs: 
it establishes a means test for 
large agribusinesses receiving subsidized 
water from the Bureau of Reclamation, 
it terminates the Uniformed 
Services University of the Health 
Sciences, USUHS, a medical school run 
by the Department of Defense, and it 
ends the future production of submarine 
launched D5 missiles, commonly 
known as the Trident II missiles. 
Eliminating or reforming these 
three programs would save the taxpayers 
in excess of $8 billion over ten 
years. 

The irrigation means test provision 
is drawn from legislation that I that 
have sponsored in previous Congresses 
to reduce the amount of Federal irrigation 
subsidies received by large agribusiness 
interests. I believe that reforming 
Federal water pricing policy 
by reducing subsidies is important as a 
means to achieve our broader objectives 
of achieving a truly balanced 
budget. This legislation is also needed 
to curb fundamental abuses of reclamation 
law that cost the taxpayer millions 
of dollars every year. 

In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt 
proposed legislation, which came to be 
known as the Reclamation Act of 1902, 
to encourage development of family 
farms throughout the western United 
States. The idea was to provide needed 
water for areas that were otherwise dry 
and give small farms, those no larger 
than 160 acres, a chance, with a helping 
hand from the Federal Government, to 
establish themselves. According to a 
1996 General Accounting Office report, 
since the passage of the Reclamation 
Act, the Federal Government has spent 
$21.8 billion to construct 133 water 
projects in the west which provide 
water for irrigation. Agribusinesses, 
and other project beneficiaries, are required 
under the law to repay to the 
Federal Government their allocated 
share of the costs of constructing these 
projects. 

As a result of the subsidized financing 
provided by the Federal Government, 
however, some of the beneficiaries 
of Federal water projects 
repay considerably less than their full 
share of these costs. According to the 
1996 GAO report, agribusinesses generally 
receive the largest amount of 
Federal financial assistance. Since the 
initiation of the irrigation program in 
1902, construction costs associated with 
irrigation have been repaid without interest. 
The GAO further found, in re


viewing the Bureau of Reclamation’s 
financial reports, that $16.9 billion, or 
78 percent, of the $21.8 billion of Federal 
investment in water projects is 
considered to be reimbursable. Of the 
reimbursable costs, the largest share, 
$7.1 billion, is allocated to irrigation 
interests. GAO also found that the Bureau 
of Reclamation will likely shift 
$3.4 billion of the debt owed by agribusinesses 
to other users of the water 
projects for repayment. 

There are several reasons why large 
agribusinesses continue to receive such 
significant subsidies. Under the Reclamation 
Reform Act of 1982, Congress 
acted to expand the size of the farms 
that could receive subsidized water 
from 160 acres to 960 acres. The RRA of 
1982 expressly prohibits farms that exceed 
960 acres in size from receiving 
federally-subsidized water. These restrictions 
were added to the Reclamation 
law to close loopholes through 
which Federal subsidies were flowing 
to large agribusinesses rather than the 
small family farmers that Reclamation 
projects were designed to serve. Agribusinesses 
were expected to pay full 
cost for all water received on land in 
excess of their 960 acre entitlement. 

Despite the express mandate of Congress, 
regulations promulgated under 
the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 
have failed to keep big agricultural 
water users from receiving Federal subsidies. 
The General Accounting Office 
and the Inspector General of the Department 
of the Interior continue to 
find that the acreage limits established 
in law are circumvented through the 
creation of arrangements such as farming 
trusts. These trusts, which in total 
acreage well exceed the 960 acre limit, 
are comprised of smaller units that are 
not subject to the reclamation acreage 
cap. These smaller units are farmed 
under a single management agreement 
often through a combination of leasing 
and ownership. 

The Department of the Interior has 
acknowledged that these trusts do 
exist. Interior published a final rule-
making in 1998 to require farm operators 
who provide services to more than 
960 nonexempt acres westwide, held by 
a single trust or legal entity or any 
combination of trusts and legal entities 
to submit RRA forms to the district(
s) where such land is located. 
Water districts are now required to 
provide specific information about 
farm operators to Interior annually. 
This information is an important step 
toward enforcing the legislation that I 
am reintroducing today. 

My legislation combines various elements 
of proposals introduced by other 
members of Congress to close loopholes 
in the 1982 legislation and to impose a 
$500,000 means-test. This new approach 
limits the amount of subsidized irrigation 
water delivered to any operation 
in excess of the 960 acre limit which 
claimed $500,000 or more in gross income, 
as reported on its most recent 
IRS tax form. If the $500,000 threshold 
were exceeded, an income ratio would 


S52 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

be used to determine how much of the 
water should be delivered to the user at 
the full-cost rate, and how much at the 
below-cost rate. For example, if a 961 
acre operation earned $1 million dollars, 
a ratio of $500,000, the means-test 
value, divided by its gross income 
would determine the full cost rate. 
Thus the water user would pay the full 
cost rate on half of their acreage and 
the below-cost rate on the remaining 
half. 

This means-testing proposal was featured 
in the 2000 Green Scissors report. 
This report is compiled annually by 
Friends of the Earth and Taxpayers for 
Common Sense and supported by a 
number of environmental, consumer 
and taxpayer groups. The premise of 
the report is that there are a number of 
subsidies and projects that could be cut 
to both reduce the deficit and benefit 
the environment. The Green Scissors 
recommendation on means-testing 
water subsidies indicates that if a test 
is successful in reducing subsidy payments 
to the highest grossing 10 percent 
of farms, then the Federal Government 
would recover between $440 million 
and $1.1 billion per year, or at 
least $2.2 billion over five years. 

When countless Federal programs are 
subjected to various types of means-
tests to limit benefits to those who 
truly need assistance, it makes little 
sense to continue to allow large business 
interests to dip into a program intended 
to help small entities struggling 
to survive. Taxpayers have legitimate 
concerns when they learn that their 
hard-earned tax dollars are being expended 
to assist large corporate interests 
in select regions of the country, 
particularly in tight budgetary times. 

The second element of my bill will 
help our Armed Services obtain physician 
services at a more reasonable cost 
by terminating the Uniformed Services 
University of the Health Sciences, 
USUHS. The measure is one I proposed 
when I ran for the U.S. Senate, and was 
part of a larger, 82-point plan to reduce 
the Federal budget deficit. The most 
recent estimates of the Congressional 
Budget Office, CBO, project that terminating 
the school would save $273 million 
over the next five years, and when 
completely phased-out, would generate 
$450 million in savings over five years. 

USUHS was created in 1972 to meet 
an expected shortage of military medical 
personnel. Today, however, USUHS 
accounts for only a small fraction of 
the military’s new physicians, less 
than 12 percent in 1994, according to 
CBO. This contrasts dramatically with 
the military’s scholarship program, 
which provided over 80 percent of the 
military’s new physicians in that year. 

What is even more troubling is that 
USUHS is also the single most costly 
source of new physicians for the military. 
CBO reports that based on figures 
from 1995, each USUHS trained physician 
costs the military $615,000. By 
comparison, the scholarship program 
cost about $125,000 per doctor, with 
other sources providing new physicians 

at a cost of $60,000. As CBO has noted, 
even adjusting for the lengthier service 
commitment required of USUHS 
trained physicians, the cost of training 
them is still higher than that of training 
physicians from other sources, an 
assessment shared by the Pentagon 
itself. Indeed, CBO’s estimate of the 
savings generated by this measure also 
includes the cost of obtaining physicians 
from other sources. 

The House of Representatives has 
voted to terminate this program on 
several occasions, joining others, ranging 
from the Grace Commission to the 
CBO, in raising the question of whether 
this medical school, which graduated 
its first class in 1980, should be closed 
because it is so much more costly than 
alternative sources of physicians for 
the military. 

The real issue we must address is 
whether USUHS is essential to the 
needs of today’s military structure, or 
if we can do without this costly program. 
The proponents of USUHS frequently 
cite the higher retention rates 
of USUHS graduates over physicians 
obtained from other sources as a justification 
for continuation of this program, 
but while a greater percentage of 
USUHS trained physicians may remain 
in the military longer than those from 
other sources, the Pentagon indicates 
that the alternative sources already 
provide an appropriate mix of retention 
rates. Testimony by the Department of 
Defense before the Subcommittee on 
Force Requirements and Personnel 
noted that the military’s scholarship 
program meets the retention needs of 
the services. 

And while USUHS provides only a 
small fraction of the military’s new 
physicians, relying primarily on these 
other sources has not compromised the 
ability of military physicians to meet 
the needs of the Pentagon. According 
to the Office of Management and Budget, 
of the approximately 2,000 physicians 
serving in Desert Storm, only 103, 
about 5 percent, were USUHS trained. 

USUHS has some dedicated supporters 
in the U.S. Senate, and I realize 
that there are legitimate arguments 
that those supporters have made in defense 
of this institution. The problem, 
however, is that the Federal Government 
cannot afford to continue every 
program that provides some useful 
function, especially when such services 
can be procured elsewhere. 

The final provision of my legislation 
terminates another wasteful defense 
program, the continued production of 
new Trident II submarine-launched ballistic 
missiles. Trident submarines, and 
the deadly submarine-launched ballistic 
missiles they carry, were designed 
specifically to attack targets inside 
the Soviet Union from waters off 
the continental United States. 

Let me say at the outset that this 
provision would in no way prevent the 
Navy from maintaining the current arsenal 
of Trident II missiles. Nor would 
it affect those Trident II missiles that 
are currently in production. 

The Navy currently has ten Trident 
II submarines, each of which carries 24 
Trident II, D5, missiles. Each of these 
missiles contains eight independently 
targetable nuclear warheads, for a 
total of 192 warheads per submarine. 
Each warhead packs between 300 to 450 
kilotons of explosive power. 

By way of comparison, the first 
atomic bomb that the United States 
dropped on Hiroshima generated 15 
kilotons of force. Let’s do the math for 
just one fully-equipped Trident II submarine. 
Each warhead can generate up 
to 450 kilotons of force. Each missile 
has eight warheads, and each submarine 
has 24 missiles. That equals 86.4 
megatons of force per submarine. That 
means that each Trident II submarine 
carries the power to deliver devastation 
which is the equivalent of 5,760 
Hiroshimas. 

And that is just one fully equipped 
submarine. As I noted earlier, the Navy 
currently has ten such submarines. 

Through fiscal year 2003, the Navy 
will have been authorized to purchase 
408 Trident II missiles for these submarines. 
Even taking into account the 
86 Trident II missiles that have been 
expended in testing through calendar 
year 2002, the Navy will still have 322 
missiles in stock once those authorized 
to be purchased during FY2003 are completed. 


The Navy needs 240 missiles to fully 
equip ten Trident II submarines with 24 
missiles each. That leaves 82 ‘‘extra’’ 
missiles in the Navy’s inventory. And 
the Navy still plans to buy at least 132 
more missiles over the next two years, 
for a total purchase of 540 missiles. My 
bill would terminate production of 
these missiles after the currently authorized 
408, saving taxpayers $6.6 billion 
over the next ten years. 

The tragic events of September 11, 
2001, and the recent resumption of nuclear 
activities by North Korea, serve 
as chilling reminders that there is still 
a potential threat from rogue states, 
and from independent operators such 
as al-Qaeda, who seek to acquire ballistic 
missiles and other weapons of 
mass destruction. I also recognize that 
our submarine fleet and our arsenal of 
strategic nuclear weapons still have an 
important role to play in warding off 
these threats. Their role, however, has 
diminished dramatically from what it 
was at the height of the Cold War. Our 
missile procurement decisions should 
reflect that change and should reflect 
the realities of the post-Cold War 
world. 

Our current ballistic missile capability 
is far superior to that of any 
other county on the globe. And the capability 
of the Russian military, the 
very force which these missiles were 
designed to counter, is seriously degraded. 


We should not be buying more Trident 
II missiles at a time when the 
governments of the United States and 
Russia have signed the Moscow Treaty, 
which calls for deep reductions in our 
nuclear forces. To spend scarce resources 
on building more missiles now 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S53 

is short-sighted and could seriously undermine 
our efforts to negotiate further 
arms reductions with Russia. 

In conclusion, the time has come to 
rethink our Federal budget priorities, 
and to redirect needed funds appropriately. 
Eliminating or reforming 
these three programs will go a long 
way to doing just that, and I urge Congress 
to act swiftly to save money for 
the taxpayers. I ask unanimous consent 
that the text of this legislation be 
printed in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 49 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘Deficit Reduction 
Act of 2003’. 

TITLE I—REFORMED BUREAU OF RECLAMATION 

WATER PRICING 
SECTION 101. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘Irrigation 
Subsidy Reduction Act of 2001’. 

SEC. 102. FINDINGS. 

Congress finds that— 

(1) the Federal reclamation program has 
been in existence for over 90 years, with an 
estimated taxpayer investment of over 
$70,000,000,000; 
(2) the program has had and continues to 
have an enormous effect on the water resources 
and aquatic environments of the 
western States; 
(3) irrigation water made available from 
Federal water projects in the West is a very 
valuable resource for which there are increasing 
and competing demands; 
(4) the justification for providing water at 
less than full cost was to benefit and promote 
the development of small family farms 
and exclude large corporate farms, but this 
purpose has been frustrated over the years 
due to inadequate implementation of subsidy 
and acreage limits; 
(5) below-cost water prices tend to encourage 
excessive use of scarce water supplies in 
the arid regions of the West, and reasonable 
price increases to the wealthiest western 
farmers would provide an economic incentive 
for greater water conservation; 
(6) the Federal Government has increasingly 
applied eligibility tests based on income 
for Federal entitlement and subsidy 
programs, measures that are consistent with 
the historic approach of the reclamation program’s 
acreage limitations that seek to 
limit water subsidies to small farms; and 
(7) including a means test based on gross 
income in the reclamation program will increase 
the effectiveness of carrying out the 
family farm goals of the Federal reclamation 
laws. 
SEC. 103. AMENDMENTS. 

(a) DEFINITIONS—Section 202 of the Reclamation 
Reform Act of 1982 (43 U.S.C. 390bb)

single farm operation operated by the individual 
or entity on other parcels of land.’. 

(b) IDENTIFICATION OF OWNERS, LESSEES, 
AND OPERATORS AND OF SINGLE FARM OPER-
ATIONS—The Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 
(43 U.S.C. 390aa et seq.) is amended by inserting

performed by any other individual or 
legal entity shall be considered jointly to be 
the owner, lessee, or operator; and 

‘‘(2) all parcels of land of which any such 
individual or legal entity is the owner, lessee, 
or operator shall be considered to be 
part of the single farm operation of the 
owner, lessee, or operator identified under 
subsection (1); 

(c) PRICING—Section 205 of the Reclamation 
Reform Act of 1982 (43 U.S.C. 390ee) is 
amended by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(d) SINGLE FARM OPERATIONS GENERATING 
MORE THAN $500,000 IN GROSS FARM INCOME.— 

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding subsections 
(a), (b), and (c), in the case of—

under this subparagraph is the number 
equal to the number of acres of the single 
farm operation multiplied by a fraction, the 
numerator of which is $500,000 and the denominator 
of which is the amount of gross 
farm income reported by the qualified recipient 
or limited recipient in the most recent 
taxable year. 

‘‘(3) INFLATION ADJUSTMENT.— 

‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The $500,000 amount

‘‘(ii) the inflation adjustment factor for 
the taxable year. 

‘‘(B) INFLATION ADJUSTMENT FACTOR.—The 
term ‘inflation adjustment factor’ means, 
with respect to any calendar year, a fraction 
the numerator of which is the GDP implicit 
price deflator for the preceding calendar 
year and the denominator of which is the 
GDP implicit price deflator for 2002. Not

By Mr. WYDEN: 

S. 52. A bill to permanently extend 
the moratorium enacted by the Internet 
Tax Freedom Act, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, predictions 
that the Internet Tax Freedom 
Act would topple Western Civilization 
have not come to pass. Since the moratorium 
on taxation of out-of-State, on-
line sales was first enacted in October 
1998, not a single community, county 
or state has come forward to prove it is 
being injured by its inability to impose 
discriminatory taxes on electronic 
commerce. There is simply no evidence 
that States have lost revenue by tech-
nology-driven commerce. On the contrary, 
the technology sector itself has 
been pounded as hard as any sector by 
the economic downturn. 

Across the country States are facing 
tremendous budget pressures. My own 
State of Oregon is facing a nearly 20 
percent budget shortfall, and Oregon 
has the highest unemployment rate in 
the Nation. The shift from black ink to 
red is the result of this Administration’s 
failed economic policies, not the 
inability of States to impose discriminatory 
taxes on Internet sales. 

Adding new taxes on the backs of 
consumers is not the way to salvage 
weakened State and local economies. 
Sales taxes are among the most regressive 
revenue measures, and imposing 
new sales taxes at this time could actually 
make a bad economic situation 
worse. A number of States seem to be 
arguing that their economic future is 
tied to taxing technology entrepreneurs 
located thousands of miles 
away with no physical presence in 
their jurisdiction. I don’t share this 
view. The reason States don’t tax remote 
sellers, as former Massachusetts 
Governor Celluci has testified before 
the Senate, is they don’t want the po


litical heat. Few of the 45 States that 
could collect a use tax on all items 
their residents have purchased out-of-
State actually do so. Most States simply 
chose not to enforce their own 
laws, preferring to export their tax 
burden to out of state businesses who 
get no benefit from the taxing state. 

Congress will soon be asked again by 
the Streamlined Sales Tax Project 
States to take the political heat for 
new sales taxes. The U.S. Senate has 
voted three times in recent years on 
whether to overturn Quill to require 
remote sellers with no nexus to serve 
the States as their tax collectors. 
Every time the Senate has rejected the 
notion. On January 19, 1995, the Senate 
voted 73–25 to table the amendment; on 
October 2, 1998, the Senate voted 66–29 
to table the amendment; and most recently, 
on November 15, 2001, the Senate 
voted 57–43 to table the amendment. 


As Congress revisits this issue again 
this year, we should remember what 
the Supreme Court said in Quill: ‘‘Congress 
is . . . free to decide whether, 
when and to what extent the States 
may burden mail-order concerns with a 
duty to collect use taxes.’’ The authority 
the Constitution vests in Congress 
to regulate interstate commerce—online 
or otherwise—is an enormous 
power that must be exercised with 
great care and caution. I believe the 
moratorium should be extended indefinitely, 
and that is what the legislation 
I introduce today would do. I am 
pleased to be joined once again in this 
effort by Representative CHRIS COX, 
and ask unanimous consent that the 
text of the bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 52 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Internet Tax 
Nondiscrimination Act’’.

S. 54. A bill to amend the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to provide 
greater access to affordable pharmaceuticals; 
to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the test of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 54 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Greater Access 
to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act of 
2003’’. 

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES. 

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) prescription drug costs are increasing 
at an alarming rate and are a major worry of 
American families and senior citizens; 
(2) enhancing competition between generic 
drug manufacturers and brand-name manufacturers 
can significantly reduce prescription 
drug costs for American families; 
(3) the pharmaceutical market has become 
increasingly competitive during the last decade 
because of the increasing availability 
and accessibility of generic pharmaceuticals, 
but competition must be further stimulated 
and strengthened; 
(4) the Federal Trade Commission has discovered 
that there are increasing opportunities 
for drug companies owning patents on 
brand-name drugs and generic drug companies 
to enter into private financial deals in a 
manner that could restrain trade and greatly 
reduce competition and increase prescription 
drug costs for consumers; 
(5) generic pharmaceuticals are approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration on the 
basis of scientific testing and other information 
establishing that pharmaceuticals are 
therapeutically equivalent to brand-name 
pharmaceuticals, ensuring consumers a safe, 
efficacious, and cost-effective alternative to 
brand-name innovator pharmaceuticals; 
(6) the Congressional Budget Office estimates 
that— 
(A) the use of generic pharmaceuticals for 
brand-name pharmaceuticals could save purchasers 
of pharmaceuticals between 
$8,000,000,000 and $10,000,000,000 each year; 
and 
(B) generic pharmaceuticals cost between 
25 percent and 60 percent less than brand-
name pharmaceuticals, resulting in an estimated 
average savings of $15 to $30 on each 
prescription; 
(7) generic pharmaceuticals are widely accepted 
by consumers and the medical profession, 
as the market share held by generic 
pharmaceuticals compared to brand-name 
pharmaceuticals has more than doubled during 
the last decade, from approximately 19 
percent to 43 percent, according to the Congressional 
Budget Office; 
(8) expanding access to generic pharmaceuticals 
can help consumers, especially senior 
citizens and the uninsured, have access to 
more affordable prescription drugs; 
(9) Congress should ensure that measures 
are taken to effectuate the amendments 
made by the Drug Price Competition and 
Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (98 
Stat. 1585) (referred to in this section as the 
‘‘Hatch-Waxman Act’’) to make generic 
drugs more accessible, and thus reduce 
health care costs; and 

(10) it would be in the public interest if 
patents on drugs for which applications are 
approved under section 505(c) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
355(c)) were extended only through the patent 
extension procedure provided under the 
Hatch-Waxman Act rather than through the 
attachment of riders to bills in Congress. 
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act 
are— 
(1) to increase competition, thereby helping 
all Americans, especially seniors and the 
uninsured, to have access to more affordable 
medication; and 
(2) to ensure fair marketplace practices 
and deter pharmaceutical companies (including 
generic companies) from engaging in

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to join my colleagues from New 
York and Arizona in introducing the 
Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals 
Act, which will make prescription 
drugs more affordable by promoting 
completion in the pharmaceutical 
industry and increasing access 
to lower-priced generic drugs. The bipartisan 
bill that we are introducing 
today is identical to the compromise 
legislation that overwhelmingly passed 
the Senate last July by a vote of 78 to 

21. That compromise was based on an 
amendment I Offered in the Health, 
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee 
with my colleague form North 
Carolina, Senator Edwards. 
Prescription drug spending in the 
United States has increased by 92 percent 
over the past 5 years to almost 
$120 million. These soaring costs are a 
particular burden for the millions of 
uninsured Americans, as well as those 
seniors on Medicare who lack prescription 
drug coverage. Many of these individuals 
are simply priced out of the 
market, or forced to choose between 
paying the bills or buying the pills that 
keep them healthy. 

Skyrocketing prescription drug costs 
are also putting the squeeze on our Nation’s 
employers who are struggling in 
the face of double-digit annual premium 
increases to provide health care 
coverage for their workers. And they 
are exacerbating the Medicaid funding 
crisis that all of us are hearing about 
from our Governors back home as they 
struggle to bridge growing shortfalls in 
their State budgets. 

The legislation that we are introducing 
today will make prescription 
drugs more affordable for all Americans. 
The nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office estimates that are bill 
will cut our Nation’s drug costs by $60 
billion over the next 10 years. That is 
why the legislation is supported by 
coalitions representing the Governors, 
insurers, businesses, organized labor, 
senior groups, and individual consumers 
who are footing the bill for 
these expensive drugs and whose costs 
for popular drugs like Cardizem CD, 
Cipro, Prilosec, and Zantac could be 
cut in half if generic alternatives were 
available. 

The 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act made 
significant changes in our patent laws 
that were intended to encourage phar


maceutical companies to make the investments 
necessary to develop new 
drug products, while simultaneously 
enabling their competitors to bring 
lower-cost, generic alternatives to the 
market. To that end, the legislation 
has succeeded to a large degree. Prior 
to Hatch-Waxman, it took 3 to 5 years 
for generics to enter the market after a 
brand-name patent had expired. Today, 
lower-cost generics often enter the 
market immediately upon the expiration 
of the patent. As a consequence, 
consumers are saving anywhere from $8 
to 10 billion a year by purchasing generic 
drugs. 

Moreover, there are even greater potential 
savings on the horizon. Within 
the next 4 years, the patents on brand 
name drugs with combined sales of $20 
billion are set to expire. If Hatch-Waxman 
were to work as it was intended, 
consumers could expect to save between 
50 and 60 percent on these drugs 
as lower cost generic alternatives become 
available as these patents expire. 

Despite its past success, however,it is 
becoming increasingly apparent that 
the Hatch-Waxman Act has been subject 
to abuse. While many pharmaceutical 
companies have acted in good 
faith, there is mounting evidence that 
some brand name generic drug manufacturers 
have attempted to ‘‘game’’ 
the system by exploiting legal loopholes 
in the current law. 

Too many pharmaceutical companies 
have maximized their profits at the expense 
of consumers by filing frivolous 
patents that have delayed access to 
lower priced generic drugs. Currently, 
brand-name companies can delay a generic 
drug from going to market for 
years. A ‘‘new’’ patent for an existing 
drug can be awarded for merely changing 
the color of a pill or its packaging. 
For example, Bristol Myers-Squibb delayed 
generic competition on Platinol, 
a cancer treatment, by filing a patent 
on the brown bottle that it came in. 

Another example cited by the Chairman 
of the Federal Trade Commission, 
Timothy Muris, in testimony before 
the Senate Commerce Commission, involved 
the producer of the heart medication 
Cardizem CD, which brought a 
lawsuit for patent and trademark infringement 
against the generic manufacturer 
in early 1996. Instead of asking 
the generic company to pay damages, 
however, the brand name manufacturer 
offered a settlement to pay the generic 
company more than $80 million in return 
for keeping the generic drug off 
the market. Meanwhile, users of 
Cardizem—which treats high blood 
pressure, chest pains and heart dis-
ease—were paying about $73 a month 
when the generic would have cost 
about $32 a month. 

Last July, the Federal Trade Commission 
released a long-awaited report 
that found that brand-name drug manufacturers 
have misused legal loopholes 
to delay the entry of lower-cost 
generics into the market. The FTC 
found that these tactics have led to 
delays of between four and 40 months— 


January 7, 2003 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S59 

over and above the first 30-month stay 
provided under Hatch-Waxman—for generic 
competitors of at least eight 
drugs since 1992. Moreover, six of the 
eight delays have occurred since 1998. 

The FTC report points to two specific 
provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act— 
the automatic 30-month stay and the 
180–day market exclusivity for the first 
generic to file a patent challenge—as 
being susceptible to strategies that 
could delay the entry of lower-cost 
generics into the market. According to 
the report, these loopholes ‘‘continue 
to have the potential for abuse,’’ and, if 
left unchanged, ‘‘may have more significance 
in the future.’’ These are the 
very loopholes that the legislation we 
are introducing today would close. 

The original Hatch-Waxman Act was 
a carefully constructed compromise 
that balanced an expedited FDA approval 
process to speed the entry of 
lower-cost generic drugs into the market 
with additional patent protections 
to ensure continuing innovation. The 
bipartisan bill that we are introducing 
today restores that balance by closing 
the loopholes that have reduced the 
original law’s effectiveness in bringing 
lower-cost generic drugs to market 
more quickly, and I urge all of my colleagues 
to join us as cosponsors. 

By Mr. INOUYE: 

S. 57. A bill for the relief of Donald C. 
Pence; to the Committee on Veterans’ 
Affairs. 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I 
am introducing a private relief bill on 
behalf of Donald C. Pence of Stanford, 
NC, for compensation for the failure of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
pay dependency and indemnity compensation 
to Kathryn E. Box, the now-
deceased mother of Donald C. Pence. It 
is rare that a Federal agency admits a 
mistake. In this case, the Department 
of Veterans Affairs has admitted that a 
mistake was made and explored ways 
to permit payment under the law, including 
equitable relief, but has found 
no provisions authorizing the Department 
to release the remaining benefits 
that were unpaid to Mrs. Box at the 
time of her death. My bill would correct 
this injustice, and I urge my colleagues 
to support this measure. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of my bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 57 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 

SECTION 1. RELIEF OF DONALD C. PENCE. 

(a) RELIEF.—The Secretary of the Treasury 
shall pay, out of any moneys in the Treasury 
not otherwise appropriated, to Donald C. 
Pence, of Sanford, North Carolina, the sum 
of $31,128 in compensation for the failure of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs to pay 
dependency and indemnity compensation to 
Kathryn E. Box, the now-deceased mother of 
Donald C. Pence, for the period beginning on 
July 1, 1990, and ending on March 31, 1993. 
(b) LIMITATION ON FEES.—Not more than a 
total of 10 percent of the payment authorized 
by subsection (a) shall be paid to or received 
by agents or attorneys for services rendered 
in connection with obtaining such payment, 
any contract to the contrary notwithstanding. 
Any person who violates this subsection 
shall be fined not more than $1,000. 
By Mr. INOUYE: 

S. 58. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax relief 
for the conversion of cooperative 
housing corporations into condominiums; 
to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I 
rise to introduce legislation which 
would amend the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 to allow Cooperative Housing 
Corporations, co-ops, to convert to 
condominium forms of ownership. 

Under current law, a conversion from 
a cooperative shareholding to condominium 
ownership is taxable at a corporate 
level as well as an individual 
level. The conversion is treated as a 
corporate liquidation, and therefore 
taxed accordingly. In addition, a capital 
gains tax is levied on any increase 
between the owner’s basis in the co-op 
share pre-conversion and the market 
value of the condominium interest 
post-conversion. This double taxation 
dissuades condominium conversion because 
the owner is being taxed on the 
transaction which is nothing more 
than a change in the form of ownership. 
While the Internal Revenue Service 
concedes that there are no 
discernable advantages to society of 
the cooperative form of ownership, 
they do not view Federal tax statutes 
as providing sufficient flexibility with 
which to address the obstacles of conversion. 


Cooperative housing organizes the 
ownership structure into a corporation, 
with shares of stock for each apartment 
unit, which are sold to buyers. 
The corporation then issues a proprietary 
lease entitling the owner of the 
stock to the use of the unit in perpetuity. 
Because the investment is in 
the form of a share of stock, investors 
sometimes lose their entire investment 
as a result of debt incurred by the corporation 
in construction and development. 
In addition, due to the structure 
of a cooperative housing corporation, a 
prospective purchaser of shares in the 
corporation from an existing tenant-
stockholders has difficulty obtaining 
mortgage financing for the purchase. 
Furthermore, tenant-stockholders of 
cooperative housing also encounter difficulties 
in securing bank loans for the 
full value of their investment. 

As a result, owners of cooperative 
housing are increasingly looking toward 
conversion to the condominium 
structure of ownership. Condominium 
ownership permits the owner of a unit 
to own the unit itself, eliminating the 
cooperative housing dilemma of corporate 
debt that supersedes the investment 
of cooperative housing share 
owners, and other financial concerns. 

The legislation I introduce today will 
remove the penalty of double taxation 

from the conversion of cooperative 
housing to condominium ownership, 
and will greatly benefit co-op owners 
across the nation. The bill does not 
apply to cooperatives which have been 
or are now being financed by any Federal, 
State, or local programs for the 
purpose of assisting in the construction 
of affordable housing cooperatives or 
the conversion of rental units to affordable 
housing cooperatives. I urge 
my colleagues’ consideration of and 
support for this measure. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of this bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 58 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in

SECTION 1. NONRECOGNITION OF GAIN OR LOSS 

ON DISTRIBUTIONS BY COOPERA


TIVE HOUSING CORPORATIONS. 

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 216(e) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to distributions 
by cooperative housing corporations) 
is amended to read as follows: 
‘‘(e) DISTRIBUTIONS BY COOPERATIVE HOUSING 
CORPORATIONS.— 

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in 
regulations— 

‘‘(A) no gain or loss shall be recognized to 
a cooperative housing corporation on the distribution 
by such corporation of a dwelling 
unit to a stockholder in such corporation if 
such distribution is in exchange for the 
stockholder’s stock in such corporation, and 

‘‘(B) no gain or loss shall be recognized to 
a stockholder of such corporation on the 
transfer of such stockholder’s stock in an exchange 
described in subparagraph (A). 

‘‘(2) BASIS.—The basis of a dwelling unit 
acquired in a distribution to which paragraph 
(1) applies shall be the same as the 
basis of the stock in the cooperative housing 
corporation for which it is exchanged, decreased 
in the amount of any money received 
by the taxpayer in such exchange. 

(3) APPLICABILITY.—This subsection shall 
not apply with respect to any dwelling unit 
the basis of which includes financing under 
any Federal, State, or local program for the 
purpose of assisting the construction of affordable 
housing cooperatives or the conversion 
of rental units to affordable housing cooperatives.’’. 
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment 
made by this section shall apply to distributions 
after the date of the enactment of this 
Act.

S. 59. A bill to amend title 10, United 
States Code, to permit former members 
of the Armed Forces who have a service-
connected disability rated as total 
to travel on military aircraft in the 
same manner and to the same extent as 
retired members of the Armed Forces 
are entitled to travel on such aircraft; 
to the Committee on Armed Services. 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I 
am reintroducing a bill which is of 
great importance to a group of patriotic 
Americans. This legislation is designed 
to extend space-available travel 
privileges on military aircraft to those 
who have been totally disabled in the 
service of our country. 

Currently, retired members of the 
Armed Forces are permitted to travel 


S60 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

on a space-available basis on nonscheduled 
military flights within the 
continental United States, and on 
scheduled overseas flights operated by 
the Military Airlift Command. My bill 
would provide the same benefits for 
veterans with 100 percent service-connected 
disabilities. 

We owe these heroic men and women 
who have given so much to our country 
a debt of gratitude. Of course, we can 
never repay them for the sacrifices 
they have made on behalf of our Nation, 
but we can surely try to make 
their lives more pleasant and fulfilling. 
One way in which we can help is to extend 
military travel privileges to these 
distinguished American veterans. I 
have received numerous letters from 
all over the country attesting to the 
importance attached to this issue by 
veterans. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues 
show their concern and join me 
in saying ‘‘thank you’’ by supporting 
this legislation. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of my bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as

SECTION 1. TRAVEL ON MILITARY AIRCRAFT OF 

CERTAIN DISABLED FORMER MEM


BERS OF THE ARMED FORCES. 

(a) IN GENERAL.—Chapter 53 of title 10, 
United States Code, is amended by adding 
after section 1060a the following new section: 
‘‘§ 1060b. Travel on military aircraft: certain 

disabled former members of the armed 

forces 

‘‘The Secretary of Defense shall permit 
any former member of the armed forces who 
is entitled to compensation under the laws 
administered by the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs for a service-connected disability 
rated as total to travel, in the same manner 
and to the same extent as retired members of 
the armed forces, on unscheduled military 
flights within the continental United States 
and on scheduled overseas flights operated 
by the Military Airlift Command. The Secretary 
of Defense shall permit such travel on 
a space-available basis.’’. 

(b) CLERICAL AMENDMENT.—The table of 
sections at the beginning of such chapter is 
amended by adding after the item relating to 
section 1060a the following new item: 
‘‘1060b. Travel on military aircraft: certain 
disabled former members of the

S. 60. A bill to amend title 10, United 
States Code, to authorize certain disabled 
former prisoners of war to use 
Department of Defense commissary 
and exchange stores; to the Committee 
on Armed Services. 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I 
am reintroducing legislation to enable 
those former prisoners of war who have 
been separated honorably from their 
respective services and who have been 
rated as having a 30 percent service-
connected disability to have the use of 
both the military commissary and post 
exchange privileges. While I realize it 

is impossible to adequately compensate 
one who has endured long periods of incarceration 
at the hands of our Nation’s 
enemies, I do feel this gesture is 
both meaningful and important to 
those concerned because it serves as a 
reminder that our Nation has not forgotten 
their sacrifices. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of my bill be printed in the 
RECORD.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Chapter 54 of title 10, 
United States Code, is amended by inserting 
after section 1064 the following new section: 
‘‘§ 1064a. Use of commissary and exchange 

stores by certain disabled former prisoners 

of war 

‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Under regulations prescribed

By Mr. INOUYE: 

S. 61. A bill to amend title VII of the 
Public Health Service Act to revise and 
extend certain programs relating to 
the education of individuals as health 
professionals, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I 
rise to introduce the Physical and Occupational 
Therapy Education Act of 
2003. This legislation will increase educational 
opportunities for physical 
therapy and occupational therapy practitioners 
in order to meet the growing 
demand for the valuable services they 
provide in our communities. 

Several factors contribute to the 
present need for federal support in this 
area. The rapid aging of our Nation’s 
population, the demands of the AIDS 
crisis, increasing emphasis on health 
promotion and disease prevention, and 
the growth of home health care has increased 
the demand for physical and 
occupational therapy services. This demand 
has exceeded our ability to edu


cate an adequate number of physical 
therapists and occupational therapists. 
In addition, technological advances are 
allowing injured and disabled individuals 
to survive conditions that would 
have proven fatal in past years. 

An inadequate number of physical 
therapists has led to an increased reliance 
on foreign-educated, non-immigrant 
temporary workers who enter 
the U.S. as H–1B visa holders. The U.S. 
Commission on Immigration Reform 
has identified physical therapy and occupational 
therapy as having the highest 
number of H–1B visa holders in the 
United States, second only to computer 
specialists. 

In addition to the shortage of practitioners, 
a shortage of faculty impedes 
the expansion of established education 
programs. The critical shortage of doc-
toral-prepared occupational therapists 
and physical therapists has resulted in 
a depleted pool of potential faculty. 
This bill would assist in the development 
of qualified faculty by giving 
preference to grant applicants seeking 
to develop and expand post-professional 
programs for the advanced training 
of physical and occupational therapists. 


The legislation I introduce today 
would provide necessary assistance to 
physical and occupational therapy programs 
throughout the country. The investment 
we make will help reduce 
America’s dependence on foreign labor 
and create highly-skilled, high-wage 
employment opportunities for American 
citizens. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of this bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as

SEC. 2. PHYSICAL THERAPY AND OCCUPATIONAL 
THERAPY. 

Subpart 2 of part E of title VII of the Public 
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 295 et seq.) 
is amended by inserting after section 769, the 
following:

By Mr. INOUYE: 

S. 62. A bill to amend title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act to remove the 
restriction that a clinical psychologist 
or clinical social worker provide services 
in a comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation 
facility to a patient only 
under the care of a physician; to the 
Committee on Finance. 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I 
introduce legislation to authorize the 
autonomous functioning of clinical 
psychologists and clinical social workers 
within the Medicare comprehensive 
outpatient rehabilitation facility program. 


In my judgment, it is unfortunate 
that Medicare requires clinical supervision 
of the services provided by certain 
health professionals and does not 
allow them to function to the full extent 
of their State practice licenses. 
Those who need the services of outpatient 
rehabilitation facilities should 
have access to a wide range of social 
and behavioral science expertise. Clinical 
psychologists and clinical social 
workers are recognized as independent 
providers of mental health care services 
under the Federal Employee 
Health Benefits Program, the Civilian 
Health and Medical Program of the 
Uniformed Services, the Medicare, Part 
B, Program, and numerous private insurance 
plans. This legislation will ensure 
that these qualified professionals 
achieve the same recognition under the 
Medicare comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation 
facility program. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of this bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 62 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Autonomy 
for Psychologists and Social Workers Act of 
2003’’. 

SEC. 2. REMOVAL OF RESTRICTION THAT A CLINICAL 
PSYCHOLOGIST OR CLINICAL 
SOCIAL WORKER PROVIDE SERVICES 
IN A COMPREHENSIVE OUTPATIENT 
REHABILITATION FACILITY 
TO A PATIENT ONLY UNDER THE 
CARE OF A PHYSICIAN. 

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1861(cc)(2)(E) of 
the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1395x(cc)(2)(E)) is amended by striking ‘‘physician’’ 
and inserting ‘‘physician, except that 
a patient receiving qualified psychologist 
services (as defined in subsection (ii)) may be 
under the care of a clinical psychologist with 
respect to such services to the extent permitted 
under State law and except that a patient 
receiving clinical social worker services 
(as defined in subsection (hh)(2)) may be 
under the care of a clinical social worker 
with respect to such services to the extent 
permitted under State law’’. 
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment 
made by subsection (a) shall apply to services 
provided on or after January 1, 2004. 
By Mr. INOUYE: 

S. 63. A bill to amend title XIX of the 
Social Security Act to provide for coverage 
of services provided by nursing 
school clinics under State Medicaid 
programs; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I 
introduce the Nursing School Clinics 
Act of 2003. This measure builds on our 
concerted efforts to provide access to 
quality health care for all Americans 
by offering grants and incentives for 
nursing schools to establish primary 
care clinics in underserved areas where 
additional medical services are most 
needed. In addition, this measure provides 
the opportunity for nursing 
schools to enhance the scope of student 
training and education by providing 
firsthand clinical experience in primary 
care facilities. 

Primary care clinics administered by 
nursing schools are university or nonprofit 
primary care centers developed 
mainly in collaboration with university 
schools of nursing and the communities 
they serve. These centers are 
staffed by faculty and staff who are 
nurse practitioners and public health 
nurses. Students supplement patient 
care while receiving preceptorships 
provided by college of nursing faculty 
and primary care physicians, often associated 
with academic institutions, 
who serve as collaborators with nurse 
practitioners. To date, the comprehensive 
models of care provided by nursing 
clinics have yielded excellent results, 
including significantly fewer emergency 
room visits, fewer hospital inpatient 
days, and less use of specialists, 
as compared to conventional primary 
health care. 

This bill reinforces the principle of 
combining health care delivery in underserved 
areas with the education of 
advanced practices nurses. To accomplish 
these objectives, Title XIX of the 
Social Security Act would be amended 
to designate that the services provided 
in these nursing school clinics are reimbursable 
under Medicaid. The com


bination of grants and the provision of 
Medicaid reimbursement furnishes the 
financial incentives for clinic operators 
to establish the clinics. 

In order to meet the increasing challenges 
of bringing cost-effective and 
quality health care to all Americans, 
we must consider a wide range of proposals, 
both large and small. Most importantly, 
we must approach the issue 
of health care with creativity and determination, 
ensuring that all reasonable 
avenues are pursued. Nurses have 
always been an integral part of health 
care delivery. The Nursing School Clinics 
Act of 2003 recognizes the central 
role nurses can perform as care givers 
to the medically underserved. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of this bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 63 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in

By Mr. INOUYE: 

S. 64. A bill to amend title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act to provide improved 
reimbursement for clinical social 
worker services under the medicare 
program; to the Committee on Finance. 

S62 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I 
am introducing legislation to amend 
Title XVIII of the Social Security Act 
to correct discrepancies in the reimbursement 
of clinical social workers 
covered through Medicare, Part B. The 
three proposed changes contained in 
this legislation clarify the current payment 
process for clinical social workers 
and establish a reimbursement 
methodology for the profession that is 
similar to other health care professionals 
reimbursed through the Medicare 
program. 

First, this legislation sets payment 
for clinical social worker services according 
to a fee schedule established by 
the Secretary. Second, it explicitly 
states that services and supplies furnished 
by a clinical social worker are a 
covered Medicare expense, just as these 
services are covered for other mental 
health professionals in Medicare. 
Third, the bill allows clinical social 
workers to be reimbursed for services 
provided to a client who is hospitalized. 


Clinical social workers are valued 
members of our health care provider 
network. They are legally regulated in 
every state of the nation and are recognized 
as independent providers of mental 
health care throughout the health 
care system. It is time to correct the 
disparate reimbursement treatment of 
this profession under Medicare. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of this bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 64 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Equity for

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1833(a)(1)(F)(ii) of 
the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.

(b) DEFINITION OF CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER 
SERVICES EXPANDED.—Section 1861(hh)(2) of

By Mr. INOUYE: 

S. 65. A bill to amend title VII of the 
Public Health Service Act to establish 
a psychology post-doctoral fellowship 
program, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am introducing 
legislation today to amend 
Title VII of the Public Health Service 
Act to establish a psychology post-doctoral 
program. 

Psychologists have made a unique 
contribution in reaching out to the Nation’s 
medically underserved populations. 
Expertise in behavioral science 
is useful in addressing grave concerns 
such as violence, addiction, mental illness, 
adolescent and child behavioral 
disorders, and family disruption. Establishment 
of a psychology post-doctoral 
program could be an effective 
way to find solutions to these issues. 

Similar programs supporting additional, 
specialized training in traditionally 
underserved settings have 
been successful in retaining participants 
to serve the same populations. 
For example, mental health professionals 
who have participated in these 
specialized federally funded programs 
have tended not only to meet their repayment 
obligations, but have continued 
to work in the public sector or 
with the underserved. 

While a doctorate in psychology provides 
broad-based knowledge and mastery 
in a wide variety of clinical skills, 
specialized post-doctoral fellowship 
programs help to develop particular diagnostic 
and treatment skills required 
to respond effectively to underserved 
populations. For example, what appears 
to be poor academic motivation 
in a child recently relocated from 
Southeast Asia might actually reflect 
a cultural value of reserve rather than 
a disinterest in academic learning. 
Specialized assessment skills enable 
the clinician to initiate effective treatment. 


Domestic violence poses a significant 
public health problem and is not just a 
problem for the criminal justice system. 
Violence against women results in 
thousands of hospitalizations a year. 
Rates of child and spouse abuse in 
rural areas are particularly high, as 
are the rates of alcohol abuse and depression 
in adolescents. A post-doctoral 
fellowship program in the psychology 
of the rural populations could 
be of special benefit in addressing these 
problems. 

Given the demonstrated success and 
effectiveness of specialized training 
programs, it is incumbent upon us to 
encourage participation in post-doctoral 
fellowships that respond to the 
needs of the nation’s underserved. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of this bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as 
follows: 

S. 65 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Psychologists 
in the Service of the Public Act of 
2003’’. 

SEC. 2. GRANTS FOR FELLOWSHIPS IN PSYCHOLOGY. 


Part C of title VII of the Public Health 
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 293k et seq.) is amended 
by adding at the end the following: 

‘‘SEC. 749. GRANTS FOR FELLOWSHIPS IN PSYCHOLOGY.

S. 66. A bill to amend title 5, United 
States Code, to require the issuance of 
prisoner-of-war medal to civilian employees 
of the Federal Government who 
are forcibly detained or interned by an 
enemy government or a hostile force

on Governmental Affairs. 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, all too 
often we find that our Nation’s civilian 
employees of the Federal Government 
who have been forcibly detained or interred 
by a hostile government do not 
receive the recognition they deserve. 
My bill would correct this inequity and 
provide a prisoner of war medal for 
such citizens. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of my bill be printed in the

‘‘(a) The President shall issue a prisonerof-
war medal to any person who, while serving 
in any capacity as an officer or employee 
of the Federal Government, was forcibly detained

‘‘(1) by an enemy government or its agents, 
or a hostile force, during a period of war; or 

‘‘(2) by a foreign government or its agents, 
or a hostile force, during a period other than 
a period of war in which such person was 
held under circumstances which the President 
finds to have been comparable to the 
circumstances under which members of the 
armed forces have generally been forcibly detained 
or interned by enemy governments 
during periods of war. 

‘‘(b) The prisoner-of-war medal shall be of 
appropriate design, with ribbons and appurtenances. 


‘‘(c) Not more than one prisoner-of-war 
medal may be issued to a person under this

By Mr. INOUYE: 

S. 68. A bill to amend title 36, United 
States Code, to improve benefits for 
Filipino veterans of World War II, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to 
introduce the Filipino Veterans’ Benefits 
Improvement Act of 2003 to give 
our country the opportunity to right a 
wrong committed decades ago by providing 
Philippine-born veterans of 
World War II, who served in the United 
States Armed Forces, their hard-
earned, due compensation. 

The Philippines became a United 
States possession in 1898, when it was 
ceded from Spain following the Span-
ish-American War. In 1934, the Con


gress enacted the Philippine Independence 
Act, Public Law 73–127, which provided 
a 10-year time frame for the independence 
of the Philippines. Between 
1934 and final independence in 1946, the 
United States retained certain powers 
over the Philippines, including the 
right to call all military forces organized 
by the newly-formed Commonwealth 
government into the service of 
the United States Armed Forces. 

On July 26, 1941, President Roosevelt 
issued an Executive Order calling 
members of the Philippine Commonwealth 
Army into the service of the 
United States Armed Forces of the Far 
East. Under this order, Filipinos were 
entitled to full veterans’ benefits. More 
than 100,000 Filipinos volunteered for 
the Philippine Commonwealth Army 
and fought alongside the United States 
Armed Forces. 

Shortly after Japan’s surrender, Congress 
enacted the Armed Forces Voluntary 
Recruitment Act of 1945 for the 
purpose of sending American troops to 
occupy enemy lands, and to oversee 
military installations at various overseas 
locations. 

A provision included in the Recruitment 
Act called for the enlistment of 
Philippine citizens to constitute a new 
body of scouts. The New Philippine 
Scouts were authorized to receive pay 
and allowances for services performed 
throughout the Western Pacific. Although 
hostilities had ceased, wartime 
service of the New Philippine Scouts 
continued as a matter of law until the 
end of 1946. 

Despite their sacrifices, on February 
18, 1946, Congress betrayed these veterans 
by enacting the Rescission Act of 
1946 and declaring the service performed 
by the Philippine Commonwealth 
Army veterans as not ‘‘active 
service,’’ thus denying many benefits 
to which these veterans were entitled. 

On May 27, 1946, the Congress enacted 
the Second Supplemental Surplus Appropriations 
Rescission Act, which included 
a provision to limit veterans’ 
benefits provided to Filipinos. This 
provision duplicated the language that 
had eliminated veterans’ benefits under 
the First Rescission Act, and placed 
similar restrictions on veterans of the 
New Philippine Scouts. Thus, the Filipino 
veterans who fought in the service 
of the United States during World War 
II were precluded from receiving most 
veterans’ benefits that had been available 
to them before 1946, and that are 
available to all other veterans of our 
armed forces regardless of race, national 
origin, or citizenship status. 

The Congress tried to rectify the 
wrong committed against the Filipino 
veterans of World War II by amending 
the Nationality Act of 1940, to grant 
the veterans the privilege of becoming 
United States citizens for having 
served in the United States Armed 
Forces of the Far East. The law expired 
at the end of 1946, but not before the 
United States had withdrawn its sole 
naturalization examiner from the Philippines 
for a nine-month period. This 


S64 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 7, 2003 

effectively denied Filipino veterans the 
opportunity to become citizens during 
this nine-month window. Forty-five 
years later, under the Immigration Act 
of 1990, certain Filipino veterans who 
had served during World War II became 
eligible for United States citizenship. 
Between November, 1990, and February, 
1995, approximately 24,000 veterans 
took advantage of this opportunity and 
became United States citizens. 

Although progress has been made, we 
must, as a nation, correct fully the injustice 
caused by the Rescission Acts 
by providing equal treatment for the 
service and sacrifice by these brave 
men. The Filipino Veterans’ Benefits 
Improvement Act of 2003 will compensate 
eligible veterans by providing 
a number of needed benefits: Dependency 
and Indeminity Compensation to 
surviving widows of service-connected 
veterans living in the United States; a 
payment increase to New Philippine 
Scouts and survivors residing in the 
United States from 50 percent to the 
full dollar amount for service-connected 
disability compensation; authorization 
of non-service connected 
disability pensions for veterans residing 
in the Philippines, but at a rate of 
$100 per month, which matches the 
amount of the veterans’ pension received 
by them from the Philippine 
government; access to veterans hospitals 
for non-service connected disabled 
veterans in the same manner as 
United States veterans; and $500,000 per 
year to the Outpatient Clinic in Manila. 


Heroes should never be forgotten or 
ignored, so let us not turn our backs on 
those who sacrificed so much. Many of 
the Filipinos who fought so hard for 
our nation have been honored with 
American citizenship, but let us now 
work to repay all of these brave men 
for their sacrifices by providing them 
the veterans’ benefits they have 
earned. 

I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of the bill be printed in the 
RECORD. 

There being no objection, the bill was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as

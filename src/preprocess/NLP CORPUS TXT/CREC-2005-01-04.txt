Stated for Mr. HASTERT: 

Mrs. NORTHUP, Mr. Clerk, on rollcall No. 2 
I missed the vote due to airline problems. Had 
I been present, I would have voted for the 
Honorable J. DENNIS HASTERT for Speaker of 
the House. 

Mr. COX. Mr. Clerk on rollcall No. 2 I was 
in consultation with the leadership staff outside 
the chamber and was therefore not present 
when my name was called. Had I been 

present I would have voted for J. DENNIS 
HASTERT of Illinois as Speaker of the House. 

b 1337 
The CLERK. The tellers agree in 
their tallies that the total of number of 
votes cast is 427, of which the Honorable 
J. DENNIS HASTERT of the State of 
Illinois has received 226, the Honorable 
NANCY PELOSI of the State of California 
has received 199, and the Honorable 
JOHN MURTHA of the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania has received 1 vote, with 
1 recorded as ‘‘present.’’ 
Therefore, the Honorable J. DENNIS 
HASTERT of the State of Illinois is duly 
elected Speaker of the House of Representatives 
for the 109th Congress, 
having received a majority of the votes 
cast. 
The Clerk appoints the following 
committee to escort the Speaker-elect 
to the chair: the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PELOSI); the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. DELAY); the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. BLUNT); the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER); 
the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. 
PRYCE); the gentleman from New Jersey 
(Mr. MENENDEZ); the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. HYDE); the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. EVANS); the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
COSTELLO); the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. GUTIERREZ); the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. MANZULLO); the gentleman

gentleman from Illinois (Mr. WELLER); 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. JACKSON); 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.

the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI). 
The committee will retire from the 
Chamber to escort the Speaker-elect to 
the chair. 
The Sergeant at Arms announced the 
Speaker-elect of the House of Representatives 
of the 109th Congress, who 
was escorted to the chair by the Committee 
of Escort. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, 
first may I thank my Democratic 
colleagues. What an honor it is 
to have my name placed in nomination 
as your leader to be Speaker of the 
House as the first woman and as the 
first Italian-American. I was honored 
by the kind remarks of the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. MENENDEZ). 
It is a privilege, as the gentleman 
from New Jersey knows and as the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER) 
knows for us to represent this magnificently 
diverse caucus. Thank you for 
the honor of being your leader. It is a 
privilege to represent one of the greatest 
forces, in my view, for idealism, integrity 
and innovation in our country. 


H4 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

My thanks to the members of the 
Democratic Caucus. 

I want to thank and acknowledge my 
husband, Paul. Thank you, Paul. In acknowledging 
Paul, I want to acknowledge 
all of the spouses who are here 
today for the contributions they make. 
I know Members all share my view 
when I say our husbands and wives, our 
spouses, and in my case my five children 
and five grandchildren, represented 
by Ryan and Madelaine here 
today, are the source of our strength 
and inspiration. Our children and 
grandchildren are the future. Many 
children are here today. We want them 
to know that we know and think it is 
our responsibility to make the future 
better for them. 

To my constituents, I am grateful for 
the privilege of representing them. 

I know Members all want to join me 
and the Speaker in acknowledging our 
courageous men and women in uniform. 


b 1345 
As we end this holiday season, we 
know it is their service that makes it 
possible for us to strive for peace on 
earth and good will to mankind every 
day of the year. 
A special congratulations and welcome 
to the Capitol to our newest 
Members of Congress, to our freshmen 
Members. You as freshmen are the 
fresh recruits. You are here to reinvigorate 
the Congress with your fresh 
ideas, straight from campaigns. We are 
all straight from campaigns. Our 
Founding Fathers planned it so that 
every 2 years Congress would be reinvigorated 
with new membership to 
bring new ideas and new energy to the 
debate. As you take your oath of office 
today, you not only enter the Congress, 
you enter the annals of history. You 
are colleagues not only with each 
other, you are colleagues with all those 
who have served before you. 
Sadly, this weekend, we lost two of 
our most pioneering and courageous 
colleagues. Shirley Chisholm was the 
first African-American woman elected 
to Congress. Imagine the courage. She 
said of her service that it demonstrated 
the sheer will and refusal to accept the 
status quo. We must make that legacy 
part of ours. When Shirley Chisholm 
came to Congress as the first African-
American woman, it was not only a 
breakthrough for African Americans, it 
was not only a breakthrough for 
women, it was a breakthrough for 
America. 
And we mourn the passing of someone 
who was a dear friend to so many 
of us here. BOB MATSUI would have 
been sworn in today. BOB was the living 
combination of intellect and passion, 
someone who understood the complexities, 
for example, of the Social Security 
system but never forgot what it 
meant simply to the lives of America’s 
seniors. President Bush rightly called 
BOB a dedicated public servant and a 
good and decent man who served with 
distinction and integrity. Thank you, 

President Bush, for that acknowledgment. 


As a small child, BOB MATSUI was in 
a Japanese internment camp. He was a 
third-generation American but nonetheless 
he was in an internment camp. 
But that never dampened his spirit 
about America or his family’s spirit. 
He went on in his words and his deeds 
with a commitment to guide us to the 
better America that was his dream. Let 
that be our legacy as well. 

And we cannot gather here today 
without talking about the unspeakable 
devastation the world has witnessed in 
South Asia. It presents a special challenge 
to us, not only for the millions of 
people who are struggling to recover 
and rebuild but for all of us who are 
called by our faith and by our common 
humanity to help those in need. When 
the victims of disasters in Asia see our 
soldiers bringing food and supplies, 
they see the best of America, an America 
that is compassionate. We need to 
work even harder, not only to present 
that America to the world but also to 
create that America here at home by 
staying true to our core American values. 
We do that by widening the circle 
of prosperity, because it is unacceptable 
that one in five children in America 
live in poverty. 

Our sense of fairness demands that 
we expand access to health care because 
health care is a right, not a 
privilege. We must promote opportunity 
with a vibrant public education 
system and by making college education 
affordable to all Americans. We 
need to strengthen community, working 
to build safe communities free of 
crime and drugs and with a clean and 
healthy environment. And we must do 
this in a fiscally sound way by promoting 
accountability, by restoring 
fiscal discipline and paying as we go. 

Above all, we must guarantee our national 
security with a military that is 
second to none, a strong commitment 
to homeland security, and a resolve to 
stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction. 
How we respond to times of 
difficulty is what will define us as leaders 
and the ability to draw hope from 
times of challenge is what defines us as 
Americans. Each generation of Americans 
has made our country stronger 
and better for the next. I do not want 
anyone because we are talking about 
losing our colleagues and our former 
colleagues and the devastation in 
South Asia, to have any of that diminish 
the cause for celebration here today 
for our new Members, their families, 
their friends, indeed for all of us. The 
lives of Shirley Chisholm and BOB MATSUI 
should be cause for celebration and 
they give us hope and proof that each 
one of us can make a difference. 

A better America is our inheritance. 
I believe that for all of us serving in 
the 109th Congress, it can also be our 
legacy. Though we are divided by party 
and this aisle, we are joined by our 
common oath to protect and defend the 
Constitution and to form a more perfect 
union. 

To our freshmen, again welcome to 
Congress. On this day of celebration, I 
join the Speaker and all of our colleagues 
in congratulating you and your 
families. Again I will say that our 
Founding Fathers made special provision 
for this House to be constantly reinvigorated 
and every person here must 
be elected. We cannot let again the sadness 
in the past weeks diminish this 
cause for celebration. 

The lives of Shirley and BOB offer us 
hope and proof, as I said. The tragedy 
in South Asia and its ramifications 
raises the expectations for leadership. 
How we respond to times of difficulty 
will define us. 

When I was a young girl, a college 
student here in Washington, D.C., I had 
the privilege of hearing President Kennedy’s 
inaugural address. In his inaugural 
address, he ended his remarks in 
the following way, and I think it was 
appropriate then and it is appropriate 
now. He said, ‘‘With a good conscience 
our only sure reward, with history the 
final judge of our deeds, let us go forth 
to lead the land we love, asking His 
blessing and His help, but knowing 
that here on earth, God’s work must 
truly be our own.’’ 

Again I have the privilege to present 
the gavel, this is getting tiresome, Mr. 
Speaker. And it is not about you. Two 
years ago when I had the privilege of 
presenting the gavel, I said of the 
Speaker that all of us are called honorable 
because of the title we hold as 
Members of Congress. But DENNIS 
HASTERT is honorable because he is a 
man of great character and dignity and 
he deserves the title. It is now my 
privilege to present the gavel to a man, 
a gentleman of character, integrity and 
skill who brings the values of heartland 
America to this highest position 
in the Congress of the United States, 
and I speak on behalf of all of our 
House Democrats, Mr. Speaker, in saying 
we look forward to working with 
you in the days ahead to create a better 
America, the gentleman from Illinois, 
the Speaker of the House, DENNIS 
HASTERT. 

Mr. HASTERT. Thank you, NANCY, 
for those gracious remarks. You have 
been an able leader for the Democratic 
Caucus in this House and you have 
helped lead this Congress with honor 
and distinction. We have disagreed on 
policy matters in the past, and I suspect 
we will disagree again in the future, 
but we both love this House of 
Representatives and the great democratic 
process of representative government. 


NANCY, we have some serious issues 
to confront in this new Congress and I 
look forward to a vigorous debate in 
the months ahead, for it is through debate 
that we arrive at the policy decisions 
that will keep this Nation safe 
and make it stronger. This House is 
where we fight the battle of ideas and 
at the end of the day we make the laws 
that govern this Nation, and so it is a 
great honor to serve in this institution. 
It is a special honor to sit in this chair. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5 

I thank each of you for allowing me 
once again to serve as your Speaker. 

The new year confronted us with two 
sad tragedies. First came the images 
from the tsunami that ravaged countries 
bordering the Indian Ocean. Our 
deepest condolences go to all those who 
lost loved ones in this terrible event. 
Just as former Presidents Clinton and 
Bush will join together to coordinate 
private relief efforts here in the United 
States, we in the Congress will work 
together on a bipartisan basis to get 
the necessary relief to those in need. 

Second, we lost one of our own on 
New Year’s Day. I too want to pay tribute 
to our fallen colleague, BOB MATSUI. 
BOB holds a special place in the 
hearts of Members on both sides of the 
aisle. He was a man of strong principle 
but a kind and gentle spirit. He was a 
proud Democrat, but he also knew how 
to reach across the aisle when the interests 
of his country demanded it. He 
will be greatly missed in this House 
and we are a better House of Representatives 
because he served here. 

Now let me welcome our new Members. 
We have 38 new Members, three of 
whom are returning after previous 
service here. Twenty-two of the new 
Members served in the State legislatures. 
Ten served in local government. 
For only the second time in House history, 
this class includes a Member 
whose ancestry is from the world’s 
largest democracy, the nation of India. 
This is a motivated and talented group 
whom I believe will make a positive 
impact on the Congress for years to 
come. 

I will not spend a great deal of time 
in these remarks to give you new Members 
a lot of advice, but I will say this. 
I hope that you will take the time to 
get to know your colleagues, to find 
mentors in this great body. There is a 
lot of wisdom and experience in this 
place. Even as each of you bring a new 
and fresh perspective to this place, 
there is also much to be learned from 
the past. 

Last month, I had the opportunity to 
travel to Europe to participate in the 
ceremonies commemorating the 60th 
anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, 
to see our young soldiers as we visited 
the hospitals and bases across Europe 
and also visit with old soldiers who had 
served and given their all 60 years ago 
to help keep this country free. It was a 
great experience. 

b 1400 
Our former colleague and Republican 
leader, Bob Michel who was wounded in 
the Battle of the Bulge, accompanied 
me along with the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. DINGELL), the dean of 
this House, another distinguished veteran, 
who will soon celebrate his 50th 
year in this body. And to you incoming 
Members, I must tell you I have 
learned much from these great men. In 
fact, I continue to learn from them. So, 
new Members, seek out the Henry 
Hydes and the Charlie Rangels and the 
Bill Youngs and the John Lewises and 

the many talented people who serve 
here. Get to know them and follow in 
their footsteps of distinguished service. 

As we open the doors to the 109th 
Congress, we close the doors of the 
108th Congress. Those returning Members 
can look with pride at the accomplishments 
of the last Congress: the 
historic reform of the Medicare system 
that includes a prescription drug package 
for our seniors, health savings accounts 
that give American consumers 
more power over their health care dollars, 
creation of the National Intelligence 
Director and a complete overhaul 
of our intelligence capabilities, 
tax relief that kept us out of a deep recession 
and will propel us into better 
economic growth in the future. 

But there is still much work to do. 

‘‘Make no little plan,’’ said Daniel 
Burnham, the architect who helped design 
the great city of Chicago. ‘‘For 
they have no magic to stir men’s 
blood.’’ 

In this Congress, big plans will still 
stir men’s blood. The 109th Congress 
will be the Reform Congress. We have 
big challenges that face this country, 
and we need big ideas to meet those 
challenges. Today we must seize the 
initiative. Today we must start anew 
the process of reforming our government. 
Security and prosperity only 
come with hard work and responsible 
government. Today let us get to that 
hard work. 

First and foremost, we must make 
this country safe from those who would 
do us great harm. Every day that I 
look out the window of my office towards 
the Pentagon building, I am reminded 
of that monstrous attack on 
September 11, 2001, that killed 3,000 of 
our fellow citizens. And each day this 
Congress has taken important steps to 
make this country safer from the terrorists 
who seek to attack us again. 

In the 107th Congress, we created the 
Department of Homeland Security and 
the U.S. PATRIOT Act and the Visa 
and Border Security Act. In the 108th 
Congress, we created the Director of 
National Intelligence. And in this 109th 
Congress we have to continue making 
progress. We need to strengthen our 
borders, reform our asylum laws, and 
improve the national standards for 
driver’s licenses. 

The terrorists who attacked us did so 
by exploiting gaps in our border security 
system, by abusing our immigration 
laws, and by abusing the everyday 
freedoms that every American takes 
for granted, yet holds so dear to their 
hearts. We must fill those gaps. 

As the Congress works to reform the 
executive branch, we must also work to 
reform our congressional oversight 
functions. In the 108th Congress, we 
created a Select Committee on Homeland 
Security. Today in the rules of the 
House that we will adopt shortly, I 
have proposed that we make the Select 
Committee on Homeland Security a 
permanent standing committee. Better 
oversight of the Department of Homeland 
Security will lead to better secu


rity for all Americans. I urge my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to 
support this effort. 

As we secure the homeland, we must 
do everything we can to support our 
troops around the world who are on the 
front lines fighting the war on terror. I 
am troubled by accounts that our soldiers 
do not have the equipment and 
the armor to protect themselves 
against roadside bombs in Iraq. This 
cannot stand. This Congress, on a bipartisan 
basis, will continue to provide 
the resources needed to take care of 
our fighting men and women. Protecting 
our homeland and winning the 
war on terror are critical components 
of making this country more secure. 

But long-term security means more 
than fighting the war on terror. It also 
means taking important steps to get 
our fiscal house in order. The President 
has laid out a bold reform agenda. We 
need to move aggressively on his reform 
agenda to protect our Nation 
from a looming fiscal crisis. This Congress 
and its predecessors have a covenant 
with older Americans. We have 
repeatedly promised to keep Social Security 
strong, and so it is there to protect 
today’s seniors and is available to 
our children and our grandchildren. 
But to keep it safe, we need to make 
some important changes. If we wait too 
long, the consequences of inaction 
could be catastrophic. 

And let me be clear. We do this without 
changing the system for those who 
receive Social Security benefits now. 
As we strengthen the Social Security 
system, we must also start a national 
debate on completely overhauling our 
Tax Code. In the last Congress, a lot of 
words were spoken on this floor about 
jobs leaving our country, about 
outsourcing. This Congress must do everything 
in its power to protect American 
jobs, and the one thing that kills 
American jobs is our Tax Code. Let me 
say that again. Our Tax Code is killing 
jobs in America. It disadvantages those 
who produce here to sell overseas and 
gives real great advantage to those 
who produce overseas to sell their 
products here. Our Tax Code is too 
complicated, it is too unfair, and it 
punishes job creators. It costs American 
taxpayers over $250 billion every 
year just to fill out their tax forms and 
comply with the IRS. America must 
have a simpler Tax Code, one that 
makes sense for all Americans. 

As we debate the larger issues of reforming 
the Tax Code, we should keep 
in mind that increasing taxes just as 
the economy is getting its footing is 
simply wrong. This Republican majority 
will not raise taxes. We should continue 
to keep taxes low by making permanent 
the tax cuts we passed in the 
107th and 108th Congresses. I disagree 
with the position of some of my colleagues 
who believe that we should 
raise taxes to cut the deficit. The best 
way to close the deficit gap is to keep 
the economy growing as we control 
spending. I appreciate the hard work of 


H6 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

the Committee on Appropriations slowing 
the growth of discretionary spending. 
We need to keep that kind of fiscal 
discipline in this Congress. 

But we also need to take a look at 
entitlement spending. We must apply 
cost-savings technology to the government 
to improve efficiency, to cut 
down on waste, fraud, and abuse. 

And as we look for ways to improve 
our Nation’s economic future, we can 
start by finally passing laws to stop 
lawsuit abuse. Most people know how 
abusive lawsuits have driven many doctors, 
especially OB/GYNs, out of business. 
This is just one example of how 
lawsuit abuse hurts our citizens, particularly 
women and children. We have 
to bring common sense to our legal 
process. And, yes, there needs to be accountability 
for those who do harm, 
but abuses must be ended. That is why 
we must pass class-action reform this 
year. 

Another impediment to our continued 
economic prosperity is the volatile 
energy market. We passed an energy 
conference report out of the House the 
last Congress, only to see it die in the 
other body. We need to finish the job 
this year. 

And, finally, as we prepare our economy 
for the next 50 years, we must 
keep our transportation system on the 
cutting edge. Our roads, bridges, and 
ports not only move people; they also 
move products. And we must make at 
home those products to sell abroad, 
and we must keep those institutions 
viable that move them from the marketplace 
to the markets. To keep our 
products moving, we must finish the 
work on the transportation bill early 
this year. 

As we move this aggressive reform 
agenda, let us ever be mindful of our 
responsibilities laid out in the Constitution. 
The Constitution begins by 
describing the legislative branch. Article 
I, section 1 says that all legislative 
powers herein granted shall be vested 
in the Congress. The mission of the 
Congress, as laid out in the Constitution, 
is stark: establish justice, ensure 
domestic tranquility, and provide for 
the common defense, promote the general 
welfare, and secure the blessing of 
liberty to ourselves and our posterity. 
One hundred nine times, newly elected 
Members of Congress have gathered together 
to be sworn in, to pledge a solemn 
oath to uphold that Constitution. 
The size of the delegations have increased, 
the numbers of constituents 
have multiplied, and the demands on 
the Members seem more complex than 
ever. But the basics of doing the job 
have never really changed. Those Members 
who do best in this place are those 
who never lose sight of where they 
came from or whom they represent. 

My congressional district lies in the 
heartland of America. My home is in 
the Fox River Valley, not the Potomac 
River. And I want to thank my constituents 
of the 14th District of Illinois 
for giving me the opportunity to serve 
them again. It is indeed an honor and a 

privilege to represent these great 
Americans. 

And as I thank my constituents, I 
must also thank my most important 
constituent, my wife, Jean, who, by the 
way, is the Speaker in our house. 

Jean, thank you for your patience, 
your guidance, your sense humor, and 
your wonderful common sense. 

As elected representatives of the people, 
each of us shoulders a great burden 
of responsibility. Our families often 
bear the brunt of that burden. And let 
me thank all of the spouses and the 
children, many of whom are here in 
this Chamber today. We want to thank 
you for your sacrifices on behalf of the 
American people. 

And as we begin this historic 109th 
Congress, let us also give thanks to our 
Creator for the blessings that He has 
bestowed upon us. May God bless this 
House and all who serve in it, and may 
God bless this great Nation we call 
America. 

b 1415 
I now recognize the Dean of the 
House of Representatives, the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. DINGELL), 
my good friend and colleague, who will 
administer the oath. 
Mr. DINGELL then administered the 
oath of office to Mr. HASTERT of Illinois,

freely, without any mental reservation

Mr. DELAY (during the reading). Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
the resolution be considered as read 
and printed in the RECORD. 

The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentleman from 
Texas? 

There was no objection. 

POINT OF ORDER 

Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise for a 
constitutional point of order. 

The SPEAKER. The gentleman will 
state his point of order. 

Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, the resolution 
we are preparing to consider, the 
proposed rules for the 109th Congress, 
in my judgment violates the United 
States Constitution which we were just 
sworn to uphold and defend. It does so 
by allowing a very limited number of 
Members, potentially only a handful, 
to constitute the House of Representatives. 


b 1430 

Article 1, section 5 of the Constitution 
states that ‘‘each House shall be 
the Judge of the Elections, Returns 
and Qualifications of its Members, and 
a majority of each shall constitute a 
Quorum to do Business; but a small 
Number adjourn from day to day, and 
may be authorized to compel the attendance 
of absent Members.’’ 


H10 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

Unfortunately, H. Res. 5 seeks to 
allow a small number not just to adjourn 
or compel attendance, as the 
Constitution stipulates, but to enact 
laws, declare war, impeach the President, 
and fulfill all other article I responsibilities. 


The very first act of the very first 
Congress of the United States was to 
recess day after day after day because 
they lacked a quorum. Just moments 
ago everyone in this body took an oath 
to uphold and defend the Constitution, 
and now our first official vote is by 
rule to undermine a fundamental principle 
of that Constitution, i.e., what is 
a quorum. It is my understanding that 
the Speaker is reluctant to judge on 
matters of constitutionality. I respect 
that. But I would reserve and inform 
the Speaker it is my intent to ask the 
question of consideration to be put. 

The SPEAKER. Does any other Member 
wish to be heard on the point of 
order? 

The gentleman from California (Mr. 
DREIER). 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, let me respond 
by saying that the gentleman is 
absolutely right when he states that 
the Chair does not rule on questions of 
constitutionality. 

I would also like to say that on this 
question that is being brought forward 
by my friend, it is very clear to me 
based on statements that have been 
made by a wide range of constitutional 
scholars that what we are doing in the 
rules package that we are about to consider 
is in fact constitutional. In fact, 
before the Committee on Rules the 
very distinguished former Solicitor 
General Walter Dellinger said the following: 
‘‘It is simply inconceivable 
that a Constitution established to provide 
for the common defense and promote 
the general welfare would leave 
the Nation unable to act in precisely 
the moment of greatest peril. No constitutional 
amendment is required to 
enact the proposed rule change because 
the Constitution as drafted permits the 
Congress to ensure the preservation of 
government.’’ 

Let me further, Mr. Speaker, say 
that the Committee on Rules intends 
to conduct further examination of the 
best way for the House to assure a continuity 
of government during a national 
emergency, and it is our hope 
that as we proceed with this work that 
further discussions will take place with 
the members of that very distinguished 
panel, the Continuity Commission, 
which included our former colleague, 
Senator Simpson, and Speakers Foley 
and Gingrich and former minority leader 
Bob Michel, Leon Panetta, Kwasi 
Mfume, and I believe we will have a 
chance to proceed with this; but I 
think it would be very appropriate for 
us to proceed with consideration of the 
rules package that we have. 

The SPEAKER. Does any other Member 
wish to be heard on the point of 
order? 

The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER). 

Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the point of order. The Constitution 
defines a quorum to conduct 
business as the majority of each House. 

The question of course before us in 
this debate is, a majority of what? 
What is the denominator in that equation? 


The precedent holds that the total 
number of the membership of the 
House is those Members who are chosen, 
sworn and living and whose membership 
has not been terminated by action 
of the House. Removal by action 
of the House is also a defined term, expulsion 
by a vote of two-thirds in article 
1, section 5. 

The Constitution also gives the 
House the authority to compel attendance 
when Members do not answer the 
call of the Chair in such manner and 
under such penalties as each House 
may provide. And, in fact, the Sergeant 
at Arms has been sent to gather Members 
by force on prior occasions. 

This amendment before us to the 
rules gives the Speaker nearly unfettered 
authority to change the number 
of the Members of the whole House to 
exclude Members who are chosen, 
sworn, and living but who do not answer 
the call of the Chair. This would 
seem to amount to a constructive expulsion 
without a two-thirds vote of 
the whole House. 

For example, suppose the House is at 
its full complement of 435 Members. A 
quorum would then be 218. Now, suppose 
only 400 Members answer the 
Speaker’s call for whatever reason. 
They are still living. They are still 
chosen. They are still sworn. They 
have not been expelled. Now a quorum 
by order of the Speaker would be 200. 
The House may conduct its business 
with only 200 Members present. If this 
is triggered in a time of national emergency, 
the consequences could be dire. 

Mr. Speaker, we heard the distinguished 
chair, or maybe he is only the 
presumptive chair, of the Committee 
on Rules, at this point; but in any 
event, the gentleman from California 
(Mr. DREIER) said a moment ago that 
this proposed rules change is constitutional 
because the Constitution could 
not have contemplated that the House 
could not function. But the Constitution 
did not contemplate that the majority 
of the Members of the House 
might in fact be the victims of an act 
of mass terrorism. Those things were 
not contemplated at the time. 

The fact is we do need to amend the 
Constitution to take care of this very 
serious question; but this provision for 
the reasons stated by the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. BAIRD), for the 
reasons that I stated a moment ago, is 
clearly unconstitutional. Certainly, before 
we take such a measure, it deserves 
much more extensive debate and 
hearings and discussion than it can 
have by three or four speakers in this 
context now. 

So I urge that Members take careful 
consideration to the question of constitutionality 
here. This may provoke 

court action, and we should not adopt 
this now in the context of an overall 
rules change with this very serious 
amendment to the Constitution, which 
is what it amounts to; it cannot receive 
adequate consideration in terms 
of its constitutionality either in terms 
of its merit. 

The SPEAKER. Does any other Member 
wish to be heard on this point of 
order? 

The gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
TAYLOR). 

Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I realize that September 11 
was a tragic day in America, certainly 
a wake-up call within the States. 

I also remind the Members of this 
body that in the War of 1812 this building 
was occupied by a foreign army. So 
for the gentleman from California (Mr. 
DREIER) to say that they could not 
have foreseen these circumstances taking 
place, what in the heck is he talking 
about? This building was occupied 
and set on fire by a foreign army. And 
yet the Congress at that time did not 
try to change the rules so that a minority 
within a minority could govern. 

If we are going to amend the Constitution, 
the gentleman from Washington 
(Mr. BAIRD) is exactly right: 
someone should offer a constitutional 
amendment. If we are going to change 
the law, then someone should offer a 
change to the law; but let us not 
through the House rules try to rewrite 
the Constitution of this Nation. 

This Nation has been around for a 
long time. It is going to be around for 
a long time, but only if we continue to 
do things as the Founding Fathers 
would have wanted us to do them and 
not some backdoor-approach like this. 

The SPEAKER. Does any other Member 
wish to be heard on the point of 
order? If not, the Chair is prepared to 
rule. 

The gentleman from Washington 
makes a point of order that the resolution 
adopting the rules of the House for 
the 109th Congress is not in order because 
it contains a provision that the 
House does not have the constitutional 
authority to propose. 

As recorded in section 628 of the 
House Rules and Manual, citing numerous 
precedents including volume 2 of 
Hinds’ Precedents at sections 1318–1320, 
the Chair does not determine the constitutionality 
of a proposition or judge 
the constitutional competency of the 
House to take a proposed action, nor 
does the Chair submit such a question 
to the House as a question of order. 
Rather, it is for the House to determine 
such a question by its disposition 
of the proposition, such as by voting on 
the question of its consideration, as recorded 
in volume 2 of Hinds’ Precedents 
of section 1255, or by voting on 
the question of its adoption, as recorded 
in volume 2 of Hinds’ Precedents 
at section 1320. The Chair would 
apply these precedents even before the 
adoption of the Rules of the House as a 
matter of general parliamentary law. 

As such, the House may decide the 
issues raised by the gentleman by way 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H11 

of the question of consideration of the 
resolution or the question of adopting 
the resolution. The point of order is 
not cognizable. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. Before the gentleman 
proceeds, the Chair would like to announce 
that any Member-elect who 
failed to take the oath of office may 
present himself or herself in the well of

H12 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

The mandate granted the majority, 
evidenced by our increased majorities 
in both Houses of Congress and the 
first Presidential majority in 16 years, 
is clear. The American people have entrusted 
the state of their security, 
prosperity and families to us; and over 
the course of the next 2 years, that sacred 
trust will be honored by action. 

We will continue to defend our homeland 
and prosecute the war on terror 
without retreat, and without excuses. 
We will provide our military, and their 
families, with the resources they need 
to do their heroic work on behalf of the 
Nation they serve. 

We will hold rogue regimes accountable 
for their mischief, and hold fast to 
our friends around the world, from defiant 
democrats in Israel and Taiwan, to 
longstanding comrades-in-arms like 
the British and Australians, to our resurgent 
allies in New Europe. 

We will work with our ever-expanding 
coalition of the willing to secure 
the fledging democracies in Afghanistan 
and Iraq, and with every political, 
economic, diplomatic and military tool 
at our disposal, see the war on terror 
through to victory. 

Domestically, our agenda will be no 
less audacious. We will continue the 
work begun in President Bush’s first 
term to cultivate an opportunity society 
of economic choice and independence. 
We will continue to break down 
the walls, erected by 40 years of liberal 
policies, between the American people 
and their dreams. We will continue to 
provide seniors with access to affordable, 
quality health care while empowering 
them with unprecedented retirement 
security. 

We will continue to take on the 
three-headed monster of over-taxation, 
over-litigation and over-regulation 
that cuts the legs out from every sector 
of our economy. 

And while the 109th Congress helps 
increase our national security and 
prosperity, we will also help American 
families raise their children in a society 
defined by the values that made 
our Nation secure and prosperous in 
the first place. We will continue to better 
protect and educate our children, to 
protect the institution of marriage, to 
protect the Constitution from judicial 
activism, and protect the role of family 
and faith in the public square. 

This rules package before us now will 
help us do this important work, work 
the American people have hired us to 
do. 

And yet, rather than laying out a 
positive vision for the next 2 years, or 
for that matter even discussing the 
substance of the rules package itself, 
some may choose this debate to launch 
the first of what I imagine will be 
countless personal attacks against the 
integrity of the majority and, ultimately, 
the integrity of this institution. 


It is a new year, Mr. Speaker, but an 
old game, and one to which we cannot 
afford to stoop. Too much is at stake; 
too much depends on the success of 
this historic 109th Congress. 

To my friends on the other side of 
the aisle, I would remind them all that 
I know what it means to be in the minority, 
to go into contentious votes 
certain of defeat, to always react to an 
agenda set by opponents. But I must 
also remind them that when Republicans 
were in the minority, we engaged 
in the battle of ideas. We developed, 
and specifically proposed, a substantive 
vision for the future of our 
Nation. 

In the 10 years since that vision was 
endorsed by our countrymen, we have 
been honored to work with all members 
of the minority on one issue or the 
other to develop successful legislative 
coalitions. 

With our close partisan margins and 
24-hour media culture, we sometimes 
forget we are opponents, not enemies. 
We would all do well to remember that, 
especially given the stakes, the significance 
and, frankly, the sheer weight of 
the agenda before us. 

So I urge all Members to support the 
rules package before us so we can immediately 
get to work on behalf of the 
men and women who sent us here. 

Mr. Speaker, I am honored to once 
again serve as leader; but even with all 
of the gratitude I feel toward you, our 
conference and toward this body, the 
source of the honor I feel today is not 
all in this Chamber. The source of the 
honor each of us rightfully feels today 
is our friends and families who have 
given us their love, the American people 
who have given us their trust, the 
men and women in uniform who put 
their lives on the line for us every day, 
and our heavenly Creator who knitted 
us together in the womb. 

Mr. Speaker, may God bless the work 
and workers of the 109th Congress, may 
God bless the cause of justice and freedom 
around the world, and may God 
continue to bless the United States of 
America. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that the balance of the time allocated 
to me be controlled by the gentleman 
from California (Mr. DREIER). 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Texas? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. DELAY) for his fine 
statement and for yielding me the time 
to discuss this opening-day rules package. 


Mr. Speaker, the House is an institution 
built upon its rules. Accordingly, 
it is very appropriate that one of the 
first orders of business for this 109th 
Congress will be to adopt a rules package 
which is both true to the traditions 
and very forward thinking in its outlook 
for the work of this Congress that 
lies ahead. 

The package we have before us represents 
the work product of many 
Members. During the initial stages of 
compiling this rules package back in 
November, the Committee on Rules re


ceived 40 different proposals from both 
Democrats and Republicans. In addition 
to that, our committee staff has 
actively sought the input of the officers 
of the House, its committees and 
its caucuses to get their perspectives 
on the kinds of changes we can make 
to facilitate the work of the House. 

All of the ideas contained in this resolution 
reflect the considered judgment 
of our colleagues and will ultimately 
improve our ability to carry 
out our constitutional responsibilities. 

Mr. Speaker, I include for the 
RECORD at this point detail on each of 
these changes in a section-by-section 
analysis. 
SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY OF H. RES. 5, 

ADOPTING HOUSE RULES FOR THE 109TH CON


GRESS 

SECTION 1. RESOLVED CLAUSE. 

The rules of the House of Representatives 
for the 108th Congress are adopted as the 
rules of the House for the 99th Congress with 
amendments as provided in section 2 and 
with other orders as provided in section 3. 
SEC. 2. CHANGES IN STANDING RULES. 

(a) Committee on Homeland Security. Creates 
a standing Committee on Homeland Security, 
and grants it legislative and oversight 
jurisdiction. First, the Committee’s jurisdiction 
includes overall homeland security 
policy so that it can focus on national 
policies affecting the Federal government. 
Second, the jurisdiction includes authority 
over the Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS)’s internal administration. Third, the 
Committee would have jurisdiction over 
functions of the DHS relating to six specified 
areas. These include: (A) Border and port security 
(except immigration policy and non-
border enforcement); (B) Customs (except 
customs revenue); (C) Integration, analysis 
and dissemination of homeland security information; 
(D) Domestic preparedness for 
and collective response to terrorism; (E) Research 
and development; and (F) Transportation 
security. Additionally, the Committee 
would have broad oversight authority over 
government-wide homeland security matters. 
Finally, changes are made to the jurisdictions 
of three committees. First, the 
Committee on the Judiciary’s jurisdiction is 
modified by adding new subparagraphs for 
Criminal law enforcement and Immigration 
policy and non-border enforcement. Second, 
the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure’s 
jurisdiction is modified to exclude 
transportation security by adding exceptions 
in two subparagraphs. Third, the 
Committee on Ways and Means’ jurisdiction 
is modified by adding the word ‘‘revenue’’ to 
the clause containing customs. [Rule X] 
(b) General oversight responsibilities—insuring 
against duplicative programs. Adds to 
the required list of content included in each 
standing committee’s adopted oversight plan 
as submitted to the Committees on Government 
Reform and House Administration a review 
of Federal programs with a view to insuring 
against duplication of such programs. 
[Rule X, clause 2(d)(1)] 
(c)(1) Membership of Budget Committee. 
Permits one member of the Budget committee 
majority and one member of the minority 
to be ‘‘designated’’ by the respective 
elected leaderships. Current rules require 
such members to be ‘‘from’’ elected leadership. 
[Rule X, clause 5(a)(2)] 

(c)(2) Rules Committee Organization. Authorizes 
the chairman of the Committee on 
Rules to serve as chairman, notwithstanding 
the prohibition on serving more than three 
consecutive terms. [Rule X, clause 5(c)(2)] 

(d)(1) Privileged motions in committee— 
Recess subject to the call of the chair. Allows 
for a privileged motion in committee to 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H13 

recess subject to the call of the chair for a 
period less than 24 hours. Currently only a 
motion to recess from day to day is privileged. 
[Rule XI, clause 1(a)(1)(B)] 

(d)(2) Motion to go to conference. Allows 
committees to adopt a rule directing the 
chairman of the committee to offer a privileged 
motion to go to conference at any time 
the chairman deems it appropriate during a 
Congress. Currently a motion to request or 
agree to a conference with the Senate is 
privileged if the committee authorizes the 
chairman to make such a motion. [Rule XI, 
clause 2(a)] 

(e) Motion to suspend the rules. Extends 
suspension authority beyond Monday or 
Tuesday to include Wednesday. [Rule XV, 
clause 1(a)] 
(f) Repeal of Corrections Calendar. Removes 
Corrections Calendar from the Standing 
Rules of the House. [Rule XV, clause 6] 
(g) Allows references to the Senate. Allows 
remarks in debate to include references to 
the Senate or its Members. Remarks are to 
be confined to the question under debate, 
avoiding personality. [Rule XVII, clause 1] 
(h) Provisional quorum. Provides for continuity 
of legislative operations in the House 
in the event of catastrophic circumstances. 
The rule allows for the House to conduct 
business with a provisional quorum only 
after a motion to compel members attendance, 
as prescribed under clause 5(a) of rule 
XX, has been disposed of and the following 
occur in sequence without the House adjourning: 
(A) A call of the House or a series 
of calls of the House totaling 72 hours without 
producing a quorum; (B) the Speaker, 
with the Minority and Majority Leaders, receive 
from the Sergeant-at-Arms (or his designee) 
a catastrophic quorum failure report 
and shall consult with the Minority and Majority 
Leaders on the contents of such report 
and shall announce the contents of such report 
to the House; and (C) A further call of 
the House or series of calls are conducted for 
a total of 24 hours without producing a 
quorum. A catastrophic quorum failure report 
is defined as a report advising that the 
inability of the House to establish a quorum 
is attributable to catastrophic circumstances 
involving natural disaster, attack, 
contagion, or similar calamity rendering 
Members incapable of being present. 
The report shall be prepared on the basis of 
the most authoritative information available 
after consultation with the Attending 
Physician, the Clerk and pertinent public 
health and law enforcement officials. A catastrophic 
quorum failure report shall describe 
the number of vacancies in the House, the 
names of Members considered to be 
inacapacitated, the names of Members not 
incapacitated, but otherwise incapable of 
being present, and the names of Members unaccounted 
for. The report shall be updated 
every legislative day and such updates shall 
be made available to the House. [Rule XX, 
clause 5(c)] 
(i) Postponement of certain votes. Adds the 
motion to reconsider, tabling motions to reconsider 
and amendments reported from the 
Committee of the Whole among those votes 
the Speaker may postpone to a designated 
place in the legislative schedule within two 
additional legislative days. [Rule XX, clause 
(a)(2)] 
(j)(1)–(2) Allowing the use of campaign 
funds to pay for certain official expenses. Allows 
Members to use campaign funds to pay 
certain, limited types of official expenses 
(e.g., handheld communication devices). This 
change conforms House Rules to current law 
(Sec. 105, P.L. 108–83), and mirrors Rules that 
took effect in the Senate in 2002. [Rule XXIV 
and Rule XXIII, clause 6(c)] 

(j)(3) Use of frank for mass mailings before 
an election. Amends the rule to conform to 

section 3210 of title 39 United States Code, 
stating that a mass mailing is not frankable 
when it is postmarked less than 90 days before 
the date of a primary or general election 
which he is a candidate for public office. Currently 
the rules states 60 days. [Rule XXIV, 
clause 8] 

(j)(4) Gift rule on officially connected travel. 
Expands the category of individuals who 
may accompany a Member or staff person on 
such a trip at the sponsor’s expense to include 
a relative of the Member or the staff 
person. Under a provision of the current gift 
rule (clause 5(b)(4)(D) of the House Rule 
XXV), a Member or staff person may be accompanied 
on a privately funded, officially 
connected trip, at the sponsor’s expense, 
only by either his or her ‘‘spouse or a child’’, 
and not by any other relative. [Rule XXV, 
clause 5(b)(4)(D)] 

(k)(1) Due process for Members. Affords 
Members the opportunity to be heard in the 
event the Standards Committee alleges the 
Member has violated or may have violated 
the Code of Conduct. Members may opt for 
either an adjudicatory proceeding or they 
can submit a response to the Committee report/
letter with their response being made 
public with Committee report/letter. Under 
the current rule, the Chairman and Ranking 
Member, or the Committee, may take action 
against a Member without a complaint, notice, 
or the opportunity to be heard. [Rule 
XI, clause 3] 

(k)(2) Restore presumption of innocence. 
Provides that no action will be taken on a 
complaint unless the Chairman and Ranking 
Minority member of the Standards Committee, 
or the Committee itself, find within 
45 days that further investigation is merited 
by the facts of the complaint, maintaining 
the presumption of innocence. Currently, if 
the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member 
take no action on a properly filed complaint 
within 45 days, the matter automatically 
goes to an investigative committee. [Rule 
XI, clause 3] 

(k)(3) Right to counsel. Provides that 
Members may select a counsel of their 
choice even if that counsel represents other 
Members. [Rule XI, clause 3] 

(1) Technical and codifying changes. Technical 
and grammatical changes are made 
throughout the rules of the House. 
SEC. 3. SEPARATE ORDERS. 

(a)(1)–(a)(3) Continuation of budget enforcement 
mechanisms from the 108th. Clarifies 
that section 306 of the Budget Act (prohibiting 
consideration of legislation within 
the Budget Committee’s jurisdiction, unless 
reported by the Budget Committee) only applies 
to bills and joint resolutions and not to 
simple or concurrent resolutions. It also 
makes a section 303 point of order (requiring 
adoption of budget resolution before consideration 
of budget-related legislation) applicable 
to text made in order as an original 
bill by a special rule. Specified or minimum 
levels of compensation for federal office will 
not be considered as providing new entitlement 
authority. 

(a)(4) Continuation of budget ‘‘deeming’’ 
resolution from the 2nd Session of the 108th 
Congress. Establishes that the provisions of 
the Senate Concurrent Resolution 95 of the 
108th Congress, shall have effect in the 109th 
Congress until such time as a budget resolution 
for the fiscal year 2005 is adopted. 

(b) Extra subcommittees for Armed Services, 
International Relations, and Transportation 
& Infrastructure. A waiver of Rule X, 
clause 5(d), is granted for Armed Services 
and Transportation & Infrastructure for 6 
subcommittees, and International Relations 
for 7 subcommittees in the 109th Congress. 
(c) Numbering of bills. In the 109th Congress, 
the first 10 numbers for bills (H.R. 1 
through H.R. 10) shall be reserved for assignment 
by the Speaker to such bills as he may 
designate when introduced. 

b 1515 
The gentlewoman from Virginia 
(Mrs. JO ANN DAVIS) is the author of 
one important provision directing committees 
to review matters within their 
jurisdiction to ferret out duplicative 
government programs as part of their 
oversight planning at the beginning of 
each Congress. 
We are also making the ability to 
consider suspensions on Wednesdays 
permanent in this Congress after the 
very successful experiment we had with 
suspensions on Wednesday in the 108th 
Congress. 
The package includes important provisions 
to allow us to function in situations 
where large numbers of Members 
are incapacitated. We discussed that 
earlier, Mr. Speaker. The provisional 
quorum language includes a number of 
safeguards to ensure that this institution 
can continue to operate during 
times of turmoil and to ensure that democracy 
will be preserved. We are living 
in a post-9/11 world and it is very 
important that we continue to expend 
a lot of time and energy dealing with 
the institutional challenges as well as 
the challenges that our Nation faces 
under these circumstances. 
I would like to say, also, Mr. Speaker, 
that we will eliminate the corrections 
calendar. This was originally intended 
to make it easier to consider 
legislation making corrections to outright 
errors that are in law but it 
turned out to after a while become 
more cumbersome than other procedures 
that we already have to deal with 
that, such as the suspension calendar. 
And, yes, Mr. Speaker, in a change 
guaranteed to draw applause from my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle, 
the House rules will now allow us to 
make reference to the Senate and its 
members, so long as those references 
are confined to the question under debate 
and that they avoid personality. 
The Senate has long had a similar provision 
and this new rule merely conforms 
our rules to theirs. I know that 
my colleagues and I share the desire to 
maintain our traditions of dignity and 
decorum in proceedings, and I believe 
that we can do that even with the rules 
change that I have just discussed. 
On another topic, the package makes 
a series of changes to our ethics rules. 
We included two provisions suggested 
by the chairman and the ranking member 
of the Committee on Standards of 
Official Conduct, number one, clarifying 
the rule on officially connected 
travel to allow a family member other 
than a spouse or child to travel with 
the Member at the sponsor’s expense 
and, two, conforming the rules of the 
House to current law which allow the 
use of campaign funds to pay for certain 
official expenses, such as cell 
phones. 
By the way, we also have included a 
provision suggested by the distinguished 
gentleman from Connecticut 


H14 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

(Mr. LARSON) to conform the rules of 
the House to current law with regard 
to the 90-day preelection limit on 
franked mail. 

The package also includes two other 
provisions addressing our ethics rules. 
The first gives Members the same 
rights to choose their counsel before 
the Ethics Committee that they would 
enjoy if they were a respondent in a 
court case. The second change addresses 
an inequity in the Standards Committee 
process requiring an investigative 
subcommittee if the chairman and 
ranking member do not act within 45 
days. This change restores the presumption 
of innocence in our process. 
Let me say that we are going to be 
hearing from the distinguished chairman 
of the Committee on Standards of 
Official Conduct in just a few minutes, 
Mr. Speaker. 

As important as each of those 
changes are, perhaps the most important 
change in this resolution will be, 
as the Speaker said in his very 
thoughtful opening statement here 
today, the creation of a new standing 
Committee on Homeland Security. It 
represents a far-reaching and critically 
important part of our overall strategic 
effort to protect the American people. 
The 9/11 Commission unanimously 
called for this action. They saw the 
need, and we believe most Members do 
as well. 

Over the past 3 years, the Congress 
has asked the American people to accept 
change in countless ways. We have 
mandated change at the Federal, State 
and local levels. We have asked for 
change from our allies and forced 
change upon our enemies. And we saw 
the need for change over 2 years ago, 
and we responded here, first with the 
enactment of the Homeland Security 
Act of 2002 and then with the formation 
of the Select Committee on Homeland 
Security. Their final report, a thorough 
and complete study of homeland 
security jurisdiction as it relates to 
House rules, was transmitted to the 
Committee on Rules at the end of last 
year. This change in House rule X, 
which governs the committees and 
their legislative jurisdictions, is a delicately 
crafted architecture. It creates a 
primary committee while recognizing 
the other legitimate oversight roles of 
existing committees. We envision a 
system of purposeful redundancy. By 
that, we mean more than one level of 
oversight and an atmosphere in which 
the competition of ideas is encouraged. 

With this jurisdiction and the legislative 
history that I will be placing in 
the RECORD, the Department of Homeland 
Security will have more certainty 
as to which committee has the primary 
responsibility for homeland security. 
At the same time, the American people 
will live with the assurance that we are 
working to prevent anything from falling 
through the cracks. 

Mr. Speaker, the new committee will 
have jurisdiction over, first, overall 
homeland security policy; second, the 
organization and administration of the 

Department of Homeland Security; 
and, third, functions of the Department 
of Homeland Security relating to border 
and port security, except immigration 
policy and nonborder enforcement; 
customs, except customs revenue; the 
integration, analysis and dissemination 
of homeland security information, 
domestic preparedness for, and collective 
response to, terrorism, research 
and development, and transportation 
security as well. 

By approving this resolution, Mr. 
Speaker, the House will do what the 
Speaker and the 9/11 Commission as 
well as the President has asked us to 
do, consolidate jurisdiction of the 
House into one committee. This committee 
will be dedicated to setting national 
homeland security policy and to 
effectively overseeing that the Department 
of Homeland Security carries out 
its mission. 

Finally, Mr. Speaker, as we discuss 
this resolution, I will look forward to 
questions from my colleagues about jurisdictional 
matters, but I will say that 
clearly the issue of referral lies solely 
in the hands of the Speaker. I will in 
no way be responding in a manner 
which would infringe on that power of 
the Speaker. Once again I want to say 
on all of these issues, and especially 
the last one, which was a great challenge 
in trying to fashion a new Committee 
on Homeland Security with jurisdiction 
that emerged from many 
other committees was not an easy 
task. I want to congratulate Speaker 
HASTERT for the leadership that he has 
shown on this and I want to thank all 
of the committee chairmen who were 
involved in this process. I believe that 
with the passage of this House rules 
package, we will be able to create a 
stronger and a safer America, which is 
a priority for every single one of us 
who has taken the oath of office today. 

I urge support of this package of 
rules. 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may consume. 


Mr. Speaker, all over Washington and 
in the country, people are talking 
today about the majority’s last-minute 
decision to abandon rules changes that 
would have eviscerated longstanding 
ethical guidelines in this House, and, 
with that, the integrity of the institution. 
And while in the end the majority 
was right to withdraw these provisions, 
they hardly deserve our congratulations. 
The Republicans simply succumbed 
to tough criticism from every 
major ethics group in Washington, several 
major news organizations and 
House Democrats. The rules changes in 
question were so egregious that rank-
and-file Republicans would not support 
their leadership’s plan. The proposals 
were so offensive that the Ethics Committee 
chairman broke with his own 
leadership on the issue. 

One of the changes would have permitted 
Members, indicted by a grand 

jury on felony counts, to continue to 
hold House leadership positions. The 
measure was similar to a conference 
rule the House Republican Conference 
passed last fall to protect its leadership 
in the event that one of them is indicted. 
The fact that they ever considered 
changing the rules of the House in 
this disgraceful manner is a sad commentary 
on the ethical compass of this 
body’s leadership. 

They also planned to eliminate a 30-
year standing rule that Members of 
Congress could be disciplined for actions 
that brought dishonor and discredit 
on this House, the people’s 
House. This standard is similar to the 
one that exists for the men and women 
serving in our military. How could 
they even think about changing the 
House rules in this regard when to do 
so would mean demanding a higher ethical 
standard from an 18-year-old private 
in the Army than we who sit in 
this hallowed Chamber? How could we 
ask more from our young people than 
we ask of ourselves? 

It is hard to believe that there was a 
time in the not too distant past when 
the Republicans touted their high ethical 
and moral standards. Mr. Speaker, 
it seems to me that this entire episode 
has been a violation of the public trust. 
When Americans enter their voting 
booths and cast their ballots for Congress, 
they give us a very precious gift, 
their trust. American voters expect, 
and rightly so, that we as Members of 
Congress will conduct ourselves at the 
highest ethical standard and uphold 
democratic principles such as integrity 
and accountability. How can we as the 
guardians of democracy spread the values 
of self-governance across the world 
if we refuse to govern ourselves right 
here in this Chamber? 

Mr. Speaker, though we should all be 
relieved that the Republicans were 
shamed into abandoning the most 
overtly egregious provisions, the remaining 
ethics provisions in today’s 
legislation will still destroy the House 
ethics process. I cannot say it more 
plainly than that. The ethics process 
will be destroyed. The tactics have 
changed, but the end result is the 
same. The House ethics system will be 
gutted. 

Mr. Speaker, the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct is the 
only evenly divided committee in the 
House. As the rule stands today, if the 
five Republicans and five Democrats on 
the committee do not reach agreement 
about the merits of an ethics complaint, 
it is automatically referred to 
investigators. This approach was designed 
to take the partisan politics out 
of the equation and to ensure that meritorious 
complaints would be investigated 
regardless of the political 
winds of the day. Under the Republican 
rules package, one-half of the committee 
will now have the power to bury 
complaints, even the most meritorious 
ones. Under the rules package before us 
today, if the committee is deadlocked, 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H15 

the ethics complaint dies. This one provision 
gives the Republicans an enormous 
amount of control over who is 
and who is not investigated by the 
Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct. 

In practical terms, the Republicans 
have granted themselves veto power 
over any complaint it does not deem 
palatable. Mr. Speaker, this rules 
package would effectively eliminate 
the 45-day deadline the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct currently 
has to act on complaints. The 45-day 
requirement was designed to prevent 
ethics complaints from being buried 
away from public view and to ensure 
that those Members who should be held 
accountable for corruption would be. 
This provision ensures that no ethics 
complaint will move forward against a 
Republican without their leadership’s 
consent. 

Mr. Speaker, we can be sure that if 
these rules changes had been in place 
in the last Congress, no ethics complaints 
would have seen the light of 
day. Under the Republicans, the ethical 
climate in Washington has eroded enormously. 
When I speak to constituents, 
I find myself telling them to forget 
what they learned in school about how 
a bill becomes a law. In times past, our 
laws were written to serve the public 
interest. But today the sad reality is 
that corporations like Enron write our 
Nation’s policies. The Medicare drug 
bill that was rammed through Congress 
in the dead of night stands as a potent 
example of the ethical erosion of the 
House of Representatives. When the 
dust settled on the prescription drug 
vote, former Representative Billy Tauzin, 
the key author and then chairman 
of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
had himself a $2-million-dollar-
a-year job lobbying with the drug industry. 
After the ethical circus surrounding 
the prescription drug vote, 
this body should be acting to strengthen 
the ethics systems in this House, 
not to destroy it. We were even unable, 
Mr. Speaker, to ascertain from any official 
of the Federal Government how 
much the bill actually cost. 

The Republican rules package will 
reduce this committee to a paper tiger. 
The American people deserve much 
better than to have a ‘‘for sale’’ sign 
placed on the United States House of 
Representatives. They deserve to be 
able to trust their elected leaders and 
have faith in the integrity of this institution. 
They should be able to expect 
accountability from their government. 
Unfortunately, the lesson we have here 
today is if you have the power and you 
break the rules, you can just change 
the rules. 

Mr. Speaker, I know there are Members 
on the other side of the aisle, because 
I know them, who care greatly 
about the integrity of this Chamber, 
and I know that there are freshmen 
Members here today eager to cast their 
first vote on behalf of the constituents 
whose trust they hold and the Constitution 
they love. I challenge those 

new Members, and any other Republican 
who values integrity and the 
sanctity of the democratic process, to 
stand up for the values of those who 
trusted you to represent them. 

Mr. Speaker, at the close of this debate, 
I will be asking Members to vote 
‘‘no’’ on the previous question so I can 
strike from the rules package language 
that would allow the Republicans to 
run out the clock on serious ethics 
complaints. Immediately following 
that vote, I will ask for a ‘‘yes’’ on a 
motion to commit the resolution so 
that we can add two important rules 
changes. The first would prohibit Members 
from negotiating lucrative job 
deals that capitalize on their committee 
membership. The other would 
guarantee that Members have at least 3 
days to read a House report before voting 
on it. When bills are rushed to the 
floor, cobbled together at the last 
minute, warm from the machine, pages 
are missing or, worse, outrageous provisions 
are slipped in by committee 
staff. 

b 1530 
Lest we forget, the provision that 
opened up private taxpayers’ records 
that was sneaked into last year’s omnibus 
spending bill was by just such a 
staff member. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote to strike the egregious ethics 
changes in this package. We owe it to 
the constituents we serve, to this institution, 
and to the Constitution that we 
adore and revere to restore the ethics 
and integrity to the people’s House. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I just want to say to the gentlewoman 
from Rochester, New York (Ms. 
SLAUGHTER) that every single Member 
of this institution, Democrat and Republican 
alike, is very concerned and 
focused on the integrity of this institution; 
and I believe that that is something 
which is an extraordinarily high 
priority for all of us. I believe that the 
package that we have coming before us 
is one which addresses many of the 
concerns that frankly were raised by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
SLAUGHTER). 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
very distinguished gentleman from 
Miami, Florida (Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-
BALART), my colleague on the Committee 
on Rules. 
Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of 
Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for yielding me this time. 
I rise in strong support of the rules 
package this afternoon. The different 
aspects that compose it are very important, 
and they will contribute to 
this House’s being able to function in a 
more efficient and effective manner in 
the next 2 years. The due-process-for-
Members aspect of this rules package 
is extremely important precisely because 
of the integrity of the House. 
The integrity of the House includes the 

integrity of Members whose reputation 
may be impugned or unfairly attacked, 
and thus all Members that make up 
this House deserve due process. And 
that is what we are trying to achieve 
today. 

I have worked long and hard in the 
last 2 years, along with the distinguished 
chairman of the Committee on 
Rules, the Speaker, and their staffs, to 
try to formulate a most difficult proposal 
for something that is, despite its 
difficulty, very necessary, and that is a 
standing Select Committee on Homeland 
Security. Due to the leadership of 
the Speaker of this House, that is becoming 
a reality today. We are doing it 
in this rules package. The provisional 
quorum safeguard is historic in nature, 
and it is constitutional. It is a constitutional 
means to prevent the possibility 
that terrorists could paralyze 
our representative government. 

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
and urge the adoption of this rules 
package. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN). 

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding me 
this time. 

Mr. Speaker, the first day of a new 
Congress should be a day for hope. It 
should be a day when all of us look forward 
with optimism to the work ahead. 
But today is not that kind of day. Instead, 
the leadership of this House is 
beginning the new year in the worst 
possible way, by gutting the ethical 
standards of the United States House 
of Representatives. Talk about starting 
off on the wrong foot. 

In the rules package before us today, 
the Republican leadership is sending a 
very clear message. They are admitting 
that they are so ethically challenged 
that they cannot conform to the rules 
they previously adopted, so they must 
now relax those rules. What an awful 
example to the Nation and to the rest 
of the world. We should be strengthening 
the ethical standards of this 
House, not weakening them. 

Mr. Speaker, the Republican Party 
regained a majority of seats in this 
body in 1994, in part by promising 
greater accountability and a more honest 
system in the Nation’s capital. 
Their actions have been anything but 
honest; and now with this rules package, 
their rush to the bottom continues. 
Today is just one more example 
of the ethical lapses we have seen in 
this House, a House where major legislation 
is now written by industry lobbyists, 
a House where Members are not 
even given the courtesy of being able 
to read bills before they are voted on, 
and a House where bad behavior is not 
reprimanded, but rewarded. 

As Members of Congress, we should 
be held to the highest possible ethical 
standards. That means not breaking 
the law. That means not dancing 
around the law, and that means conducting 
ourselves in a manner that reflects 
credibility on the House at all 
times. 


H16 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

Facing the possible indictment of a 
Member of their leadership, the Republicans 
attempted in secret to change 
the rules to protect their ethically 
challenged colleagues. However, in the 
face of mounting public controversy, 
the public leadership caved last night 
and rescinded the change. They blinked 
and they buckled. But the Speaker’s 
spokesman commented on this flip-flop 
saying that the issue had become a 
‘‘distraction.’’ Not wrong, mind you, 
but just distracting. I am getting whiplash 
just watching all this stuff. 

But, Mr. Speaker, let us be clear that 
the Republican leadership did not find 
religion in this issue. If they believed 
that what they were about to do was 
truly wrong, they would not have proposed 
these rule changes in the first 
place. But while Republicans try to 
pull a fast one claiming that the majority 
leader fell on his sword for the 
good of his party, the truth is that the 
rules package for the 109th Congress 
still in a very meaningful way fundamentally 
weakens the ethics system 
here in the House of Representatives. 

I strongly urge the American people 
and members of the press and my colleagues 
to closely examine these rule 
changes, especially those made to the 
ethics standards. Under the old rules, a 
properly filed ethics complaint is automatically 
investigated if that complaint 
is not acted upon within 45 days. 

Remember, as the gentlewoman from 
New York stated, that the ethics committee 
is evenly divided between 
Democrats and Republicans; and to ensure 
that partisan politics did not prevail 
in the ethics process, a tie vote ensures 
a formal investigation. 

But under this proposed rules package, 
there must be a majority vote to 
investigate a properly filed ethics complaint; 
and if that complaint is not 
acted upon with within 45 days, that 
ethics complaint dies. In other words, 
Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the committee, 
whoever that may be, could 
stonewall the process, refuse to call for 
a vote, and ultimately kill any ethics 
complaint without any action. But this 
also allows any Member potentially 
under investigation to run the clock 
out by stonewalling investigators until 
the 45 days are up. 

The American people deserve better 
than this from their elected representatives. 
We serve at the pleasure of our 
constituents, and we have a responsibility 
to uphold the highest ethical 
standards. Over the past decade, the 
Republican leadership has careened 
down the pathway of irresponsibility, 
and now we are at a crossroads. There 
are those of us who truly believe Members 
of Congress should be held to a 
higher standard and who will make a 
stand and fight for real accountability 
from our colleagues, and there will be 
those who blindly follow their leadership, 
who vote to weaken the rules of 
this institution, first written by Thomas 
Jefferson, because they fear the retribution 
of their leaders. 

This should be a place where honesty 
and integrity are the standard, not a 

place where the rules are changed 
merely to protect a powerful few from 
their own ethical shortcomings. 

Mr. Speaker, we can stop this debacle. 
Let us start over. Let us make this 
right. Let us make the House of Representatives 
an example of high standards 
and ethical decency. I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this rules 
package. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

Let me say after having heard from 
two of my Committee on Rules colleagues 
that I anxiously look forward 
to working with them in a bipartisan 
way to try to proceed with the deliberations 
in consideration of measures 
of this House. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
HEFLEY), the distinguished chairman of 
the Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct. 

Mr. HEFLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding me this 
time. 

I am going to support this rules 
package. I was not. I came here today 
fully expecting not to support it; but 
because of the action taken last 
evening where we reconsidered some of 
the suggestions that had been made, I 
think we have a package now that we 
can live with. I think some of the recommendations 
that are in here are ill 
conceived, and I would hope to work 
with the chairman again in a bipartisan 
way with him and his committee 
and with the leadership to make some 
additional changes as we go through 
the process. 

But I want to thank him and thank 
the Speaker and the leadership for accommodating 
my concerns about some 
of the amendments that I thought were 
the most difficult and the ones that 
created the biggest problem in trying 
to implement the Code of Official Conduct. 


Each of us, in fact all of us, individually 
and collectively, have a responsibility 
to maintain the highest standard 
of conduct for this House. And changes 
in the rules, as was said by the previous 
speaker, should strengthen, not 
weaken, those standards. As it stands 
now, I think the previous speaker said 
we are gutting the ethics committee 
standards now. We are not as it stands 
now. I would not be standing up here 
encouraging people to support the rules 
package if in any way I thought we 
were gutting it. We are tweaking it, 
and as I said earlier, we are tweaking 
some of it in a way that I wish we were 
not tweaking it, but it does not gut it. 
It is something that the rules work 
pretty well the way they are now, and 
this does not change that that much. 

I have had the privilege of serving on 
the Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct since 1997 and have had an additional 
responsibility as serving as 
chairman since 2001. And during that 
time, I have learned one paramount 
lesson: ethics must be bipartisan. The 
ethics process must be bipartisan. Eth


ics reform must be bipartisan, and the 
ethics committee must be bipartisan. 
And I can tell the Members the ethics 
committee is bipartisan. 

I see our ranking member over here. 
I could not have a better partner in 
this ethics process than the gentleman 
from West Virginia (Mr. MOLLOHAN). 
The ethics committee is a bipartisan 
committee that follows the evidence 
wherever the evidence leads. Meaningful 
ethics reform must be genuinely bipartisan. 
To have a bipartisan process, 
any significant change in the ethics 
rules must be made only after careful, 
thorough bipartisan consideration, as 
was done in 1989 and 1997. 

In 1989 and 1997, ethics reform came 
only after a broad consensus developed 
for change. I have always strongly supported 
reevaluating the ethics rules 
and procedures and making changes 
wherever a need is shown. I think a 
number of the criticisms of the ethics 
process that have been made over the 
past year are well taken and should be 
looked at. On the other hand, since I 
joined the committee, almost every 
significant decision, I believe every significant 
decision, has been made on a 
unanimous vote. 

Despite the deletion of the amendment 
that I found the most objectionable 
to the Code of Conduct, the rules 
package includes a number of provisions 
that would make major changes 
in the ethics-related rules, but as to 
which neither the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct nor 
Members outside the rules process were 
consulted. While I will not vote against 
the rules package because of these provisions, 
I urge the leadership to reconsider 
all the amendments added to the 
committee’s procedural rules without a 
bipartisan process. 

In 1997 the House, through a bipartisan 
task force, carefully studied the 
Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct’s enforcement procedures, 
made a series of changes. The rules 
package includes provisions that would 
significantly alter those procedures. It 
would be a mistake to reverse these bipartisan 
determinations without a bipartisan 
process of our own. 

The 45-day thing that has been mentioned, 
I do not like that. I think that 
creates a problem in trying to implement 
a fair and even-handed ethics 
process. I would like to see that removed. 


When in 1997 the Bipartisan Task 
Force Report was before the House, the 
House significantly rejected, on a bipartisan 
vote of 181 to 236, an amendment 
that would have required automatic 
dismissal of any complaint after 
180 days, not 45 days. The reason for rejection 
of that amendment, as set out 
in the floor debate, is that such an artificial 
time limit on the life of a complaint 
would serve to encourage deadlock 
within the committee and partisanship 
among committee members. 

I could go on and on, Mr. Speaker. I 
think that is something we need to 
look at. The ranking member and I and 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H17 

the members of the ethics committee 
have been considering a group of suggestions 
that we would like to bring to 
the full House. We would like to do 
that, Mr. Speaker, shortly after the 
new session of Congress convenes, when 
we are ready for that process. I think 
that is the way it ought to be done. 
These are the people that struggle with 
these issues every day. I think they 
ought to be concerned about what we 
think would make the process better. 
They do not have to follow it, but at 
least be concerned about it. The process 
in the House is not perfect. Let us 
strive to make it perfect. On this one 
issue, let us act together on a bipartisan 
basis. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LAHOOD). Without objection, the gentleman 
from Massachusetts (Mr. 
MCGOVERN) will control the time for 
the minority. 

There was no objection. 

Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland 
(Mr. HOYER), the distinguished minority 
whip. 

Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me this 
time. I thank the gentleman from Colorado 
(Mr. HEFLEY) for his presentation. 

We were told the President wants to 
proceed on a bipartisan fashion in the 
next 4 years to deal with the important 
issues that confront our Nation. 

b 1545 
I think that is appropriate and, hopefully, 
we will do that. However, on this 
first day, the rules package is usually a 
partisan package. It was when Democrats 
were in charge; it is now when 
Republicans are in charge. That is understandable. 
But as the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. HEFLEY) has so correctly 
pointed out, there was an exception, 
and that exception was dealing 
with the ethics of this institution 
which, in fact, deals with the confidence 
that the American public has in 
this institution. 
Mr. Speaker, the opening day of a 
new Congress should be one in which 
the interests of this institution are 
paramount. The body of rules we adopt 
to govern debate, decorum, and the actions 
of our Members should reflect 
that. To be sure, the American people 
who elected us to this great body can 
expect to see sharp differences on this 
floor over the substance of legislation. 
That is as the framers of the Constitution 
planned. 
But the framers also intended, I believe, 
and the American people deserve 
to know, that this House is committed 
to holding its Members to the highest 
ethical standards. 
Today, as I think has been attested 
to by the gentleman from Colorado 
(Mr. HEFLEY), the House moves in the 
wrong direction. The rules proposed for 
the 109th House ignore the fundamental 
principle of protecting the ethics 
of this House. The proposed Republican 
rules before us will seriously 
weaken the ability of the Committee 

on Standards of Official Conduct to enforce 
standards of integrity by providing 
that no action will be taken on 
a properly filed ethics complaint after 
45 days unless the committee votes by 
a majority vote to take action. The 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CARDIN) 
will speak, who chaired with Bob Livingston, 
our former colleague, the 
amendment of these rules. 

Under the current rules, which have 
functioned well since 1997, a properly 
filed complaint that has not been addressed 
by the chair and ranking member 
or the committee itself automatically 
goes to an investigative subcommittee. 
That is as it should be. Inaction 
ought not to be tantamount to 
dismissal. That is what this proposal 
does. The Republican proposal would 
make it extremely difficult to investigate 
properly filed complaints. 

Under this new rule, either side, either 
side will be able to guarantee a 
deadlock when a legitimate, factually 
strong ethics complaint against a 
Member is filed, provided the chair or 
ranking member take no action. 

We have been told that the most 
egregious attempts to weaken the ethics 
systems have been abandoned. I beg 
to differ. The most egregious attempt 
is the one before us now currently remaining 
in this rule. Let no one miss 
this distinction: the proposal to protect 
an indicted leader, a proposal that 
has been withdrawn by the majority, 
always was speculative, because we do 
not know if a leader will be indicted. In 
sharp contrast, however, the rule before 
us will have a concrete, demonstrable 
effect on every ethics complaint 
filed from this day forward. 

Mr. Speaker, the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct is the 
only mechanism that this institution 
has to police itself. When we weaken 
the committee, we weaken the standards 
that we are all expected to uphold, 
and we erode public confidence in this 
institution. 

The gentleman from California (Mr. 
DREIER) spoke eloquently to the maintenance 
of the status quo when he was 
in the minority urging us to be vigilant 
in rooting out unethical behavior in 
this institution. He was right then. He 
is not correct now in offering this rule 
which weakens that process. 

The adoption of this rule will substantially 
weaken our commitment to 
ensuring ethical conduct. I think the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. HEFLEY) 
was right in his letter. I think he had 
the intellectual honesty and integrity 
on this floor when he spoke. He is 
going to vote for the rule because he 
believes that some offensive aspects of 
the proposal have been taken out. But 
I tell my friend that the most egregious, 
long-lasting, impacting change 
remains in this package. 

Therefore, I urge my colleagues on 
behalf of the American people, on behalf 
of the integrity of this institution, 
on behalf of our commitment to ensure 
ethical conduct on behalf of the American 
people, that this not be passed. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

I would like to respond to my very 
good friend from Maryland by saying 
that I may not be as eloquent today as 
I was when I was in the minority, but 
I continue to share my very strong 
commitment to ensure the integrity 
and the behavior of Members of this institution. 
I also will say as my friend 
said, it is very clear that the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. HEFLEY), 
chairman of the Committee on Standards 
of Official Conduct, has made it 
clear that he is supportive of this package. 
I and my colleagues looked at 
these recommendations, all of which 
emerged from members and former 
members of the Committee on Standards 
of Official Conduct. I also believe 
that it is very possible for us to maintain 
the highest ethical standards and 
to continue to ensure, to now ensure 
that due process is entitled to Members 
of this institution as they proceed with 
matters before that committee. 

So I believe that this package is one 
which should enjoy strong bipartisan 
support, because when it comes to matters 
of ethics it will address the concern 
and the protection of Members of 
both the minority and the majority, as 
well as this institution as a whole. 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman 
from West Virginia (Mr. MOLLOHAN), 
the ranking member of the 
Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct. 

(Mr. MOLLOHAN asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 

Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address the ethics-related 
provisions that are in this package at 
the insistence of the Committee on 
Rules. I had the honor of serving as 
ranking member of the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct in the 
last Congress. It was an honor to serve 
with the gentleman from Colorado 
(Chairman HEFLEY), as he always managed 
to chair the committee in a completely 
bipartisan manner. 

The headlines in this morning’s paper 
say ‘‘GOP Abandons Ethics Changes.’’ 
It turns out that the headline is at best 
only half right. It is true that the most 
outrageous ethics undermining provision 
has been deleted from the rules 
package, but other provisions, provisions 
that would make major changes 
in the way the Committee on Standards 
of Official Conduct handles enforcements 
of the rules, they remain. 

There should be no misunderstanding 
that these provisions that remain 
would seriously undermine the ethics 
process in the House, both because of 
the changes they would make in committee 
procedures, but, and equally important, 
because of the partisan way in 
which they are being adopted. If there 
is to be a meaningful, viable ethics 
process in the House, it must be a 
genuinely bipartisan process. That 


H18 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

point should be self-evident. How could 
there be a legitimate ethics process 
that is operated on a partisan basis? 
And to have a bipartisan process, it is 
absolutely essential that any major 
changes in the rules be made on a truly 
bipartisan basis. What is more, because 
of the importance and the sensitive nature 
of the ethics rules, it is also essential 
that any proposed changes be considered 
in a thoughtful, considered, and 
open way, with all Members being 
given the opportunity for input, Democrats 
and Republicans. 

Until today, the House recognized 
these fundamental points. Until today, 
the House has not attempted to make 
major changes in the ethics rules or 
the Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct procedures in a slapdash way, 
with literally only hours of consideration, 
and on a party line vote. 

It will probably come as no surprise 
that the materials issued by the Committee 
on Rules that attempt to justify 
these amendments are based entirely 
on misstatements of the current rules. 
For example, under the benign sounding 
heading, ‘‘Restore Presumption of 
Innocence,’’ the Committee on Rules 
memorandum states, ‘‘Currently, if the 
chairman and ranking minority member 
take no action on a properly filed 
complaint within 45 days, the matter 
automatically goes to an investigative 
subcommittee.’’ Fine. But that statement 
is incomplete and, therefore, misleading. 


The rules that have been in effect 
since 1997 clearly provide that at any 
time that a complaint is before the 
chairman and ranking member for consideration, 
either one of them may 
place the complaint on the committee’s 
agenda and when either one of 
them does that, an investigative committee 
cannot be established without a 
majority vote of the committee. 

Another example, Mr. Speaker. 
Under the heading ‘‘Due Process for 
Members,’’ the Committee on Rules 
memorandum states that, ‘‘Under the 
current rule, the chairman and ranking 
member or the committee may take 
action against a Member without a 
complaint, notice, or the opportunity 
to be heard.’’ 

This statement clearly implies that 
the committee may determine that a 
Member has committed a violation or 
impose a sanction without the Member 
having such rights, and that suggestion, 
Mr. Speaker, is flatly wrong. The 
rules are replete with the rights for 
Members who are accused of any violation. 


When you turn to the actual text of 
the ‘‘due process’’ amendments, you 
find that what these amendments are 
concerned with is not committee actions 
that impose sanctions or determine 
violations, but instead on committee 
letters or statements that ‘‘reference 
the official conduct of a Member.’’ 
It may be well that the rules 
should provide certain rights to a 
Member whose conduct is going to be 
discussed in a letter or statement that 

the committee issues publicly, but 
what should those rights be? They 
should be determined through a deliberative, 
fair, bipartisan process. 

But one specific right that this proposed 
rule provides to those Members 
is the right to demand an immediate 
trial in front of an adjudicatory subcommittee 
of the Committee on Standards 
of Official Conduct. But in the circumstances 
that the rule addresses, 
that trial would take place before the 
committee has conducted any formal 
investigation of the matter. No committee 
that is serious about conducting 
its business would allow itself to be put 
in that circumstance. So the effect of 
this amendment would be that whenever 
any alleged misconduct is brought 
to the committee’s attention, the committee 
may be forced to choose between 
either launching a formal investigation 
of the matter or dismissing it 
entirely. Both of these rule changes 
lack careful consideration and, more 
seriously, are brought to us today 
through a partisan process. 

I’d like to address the ethics-related provisions 
that are in this package at the insistence 
of the Rules Committee. I had the honor of 
serving as ranking member of the Ethics Committee 
in the last Congress, and I also served 
on the committee for 6 years during another 
time of controversy in the late 1980s. It was 
an honor to serve during the last 2 years with 
Chairman HEFLEY, as he always managed the 
committee in a completely bipartisan manner. 

A headline in this morning’s newspaper 
says, ‘‘GOP abandons ethics changes.’’ It 
turns out that the headline is at best only half 
right. It’s true that the most outrageous ethics-
undermining provision has been deleted from 
the rules package, but other provisions—provisions 
that would make major changes in the 
way the Ethics Committee handles enforcement 
of the rules—remain. 

There should be no misunderstanding that 
these provisions that remain would seriously 
undermine the ethics process in the House, 
both because of the changes they would make 
in committee procedures, and, equally important, 
because of the partisan way in which 
they would be adopted. 

If there is to be a meaningful, viable ethics 
process in the House, it must be a genuinely 
bipartisan process. That point should be self-
evident—how could there be a legitimate ethics 
process that is operated on a partisan 
basis? And to have a bipartisan process, it’s 
absolutely essential that any major changes in 
the rules be made on a truly bipartisan basis. 
What’s more, because of the importance, and 
the sensitive nature of the ethics rules, it’s 
also essential that any proposed changes be 
considered in a thoughtful, considered, and 
open way, with all Members being given the 
opportunity for input—Democrats and Republicans. 


Until today, the House recognized these 
fundamental points. Until today, the House 
has not attempted to make major changes in 
the ethics rules or the Ethics Committee procedures 
in a slapdash way, with literally only 
hours of consideration, and on a party-line 
vote. 

It will probably come as no surprise that the 
materials issued by the Rules Committee that 
attempt to justify these amendments are 

based entirely on misstatements of the current 
rules. For example, under the benign-sounding 
heading, ‘‘Restore Presumption of Innocence,’’ 
the Rules Committee memorandum states, 
and I quote: 

‘‘Currently, if the chairman and ranking minority 
member take no action on a properly 
filed complaint within 45 days, the matter automatically 
goes to an investigative subcommittee.’’ 


That statement is incomplete—and therefore 
misleading. The rules that have been in effect 
since 1997 clearly provide that at any time 
that a complaint is before the chairman and 
ranking member for consideration, either one 
of them may place the complaint on the committee’s 
agenda, and when either one of them 
does that, an investigative subcommittee cannot 
be established without a majority vote of 
the committee. 

Another example: under the heading, ‘‘Due 
Process for Members,’’ the Rules Committee 
memorandum states that, and I quote: 

‘‘Under the current rule, the chairman and 
ranking member, or the committee, may take 
action against a Member without a complaint, 
notice, or the opportunity to be heard.’’ 

This statement clearly implies that the committee 
may determine that a Member has 
committed a violation or impose a sanction 
without the Member having such rights, and 
that suggestion is flatly wrong. The rules are 
replete with rights for Members who are accused 
of any violation, and because of the bipartisan 
makeup of the committee, Members 
are typically accorded rights well beyond those 
required by the rules. 

When you turn to the actual text of the ‘‘due 
process’’ amendments, you find that what 
these amendments are concerned with is not 
committee actions that impose sanctions or 
determine violations, but instead committee 
letters or statements that ‘‘reference the official 
conduct of a Member.’’ It may well be that 
the rules should provide certain rights to a 
Member whose conduct is going to be discussed 
in a letter or statement that the committee 
issues publicly, but what should those 
rights be? 

They should be determined through a deliberative, 
fair, bipartisan process. But one specific 
right that this proposed rule provides to 
those Members is the right to demand an immediate 
trial in front of an adjudicatory subcommittee 
of the Ethics Committee. But in the 
circumstances that the rule addresses, that 
trial would take place before the committee 
has conducted any formal investigation of the 
matter. No committee that is serious about 
conducting its business would allow itself to be 
put in that circumstance. So the effect of this 
amendment would be that whenever any alleged 
misconduct is brought to the committee’s 
attention, the committee may be forced 
to choose between either launching a formal 
investigation of the matter, or dismissing it entirely. 
There would be no chance for an expedited 
resolution of the case, even in those instances 
in which the committee believes it already 
has all the basic facts, and the conduct 
involved probably does not warrant a formal 
sanction. Both of these rule changes lack 
careful consideration and, more seriously, are 
brought to us today through a partisan process. 


But the proposed amendment that raises 
even more concern is the one that provides 
for automatic dismissal of any complaint that 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H19 

is not acted upon within a period as short as 
45 days. When the House last considered Ethics 
Committee procedures, in 1997, it rejected, 
on a bipartisan vote, an amendment that 
would have required the automatic dismissal 
of any complaint that is not acted upon within 
180 days. 

The reason that amendment was rejected is 
that it was recognized that such a time limit 
would encourage deadlock on the committee, 
and partisanship among the committee members. 
Under a time limit, if one side or the 
other is uncomfortable about dealing with a 
particular complaint, those Members don’t 
have to discuss it or otherwise try to deal with 
it—by their just doing nothing, the complaint 
will disappear. Yet now this provision for automatic 
dismissal has reappeared, and this time 
it has a far shorter time frame for committee 
consideration than the nearly identical provision 
that the House soundly rejected in 1997. 

I want to close by asking all Members, including 
all Members of the leadership on both 
sides of the Aisle, to give some serious consideration—
not just today, but in the weeks 
and months ahead—to whether you genuinely 
want to have a meaningful ethics process in 
the House, and what we as Members, individually 
and collectively, have to do in order for 
such a process to exist. As I said at the outset, 
for this process to exist, it has to be a 
truly bipartisan one, and it has to be treated 
with seriousness and respect. It has to be recognized 
that the basic purpose of the process 
is to consider and address legitimate ethics 
concerns, and if Members are successful in 
using the process for partisan, political purposes, 
it is going to fail. The approval of these 
amendments would seriously undermine the 
process and, for that reason alone, this rules 
package should be defeated. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. BOEHLERT), 
the very distinguished chairman 
of the Committee on Science. 

(Mr. BOEHLERT asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. BOEHLERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of this balanced rules 
package. I want to speak particularly 
to the provisions regarding homeland 
security. To determine whether a proposed 
regime to oversee homeland security 
is appropriate, one cannot just 
look at a flow chart. The simplest 
structure is not necessarily the best, 
nor is one that is unduly complex. One 
has to look at how a proposed structure 
will actually function and what it 
can and cannot accomplish. 

The homeland jurisdiction being proposed 
in this package strikes the right 
balance between a system that is too 
centralized and one that is too diffuse. 
First, I should say that the most important 
and necessary change regarding 
governance of the Department of 
Homeland Security was made 2 years 
ago when we created a Subcommittee 
on Homeland Security on the Committee 
on Appropriations. But having a 
single committee that can look across 
the Department of Homeland Security 
from an authorizing perspective is also 
a sensible move, and the new committee 
created in this package will do 
that. 

b 1600 

What would not make sense, however, 
simple as it might seem, is giving 
sole authority over all aspects of homeland 
security to the new committee. 
Homeland security is too diffuse and 
important a government activity to 
rest with one committee. Almost every 
activity of every Federal agency has 
some relationship to homeland security, 
and almost every activity of the 
Department of Homeland Security impinges 
on the activities of other agencies. 


An appropriate congressional oversight 
structure has to take account of 
that basic fact. A structure that overly 
centralized homeland security oversight 
would make it harder to evaluate 
the Department of Homeland Security 
in the context of the other activities of 
the Federal Government. An overcentralized 
structure could also make a 
congressional committee a captive of 
the agency that it oversees. 

I know that it is very easy to denigrate 
arguments against a single, centralized 
Select Committee on Homeland 
Security as so much turf fighting. 
But in reality it is simply intellectually 
lazy to assume that a centralized 
structure would enable Congress to do 
its work more effectively. 

I found especially ironic a Washington 
Post editorial that called for a 
highly centralized structure. The editorial 
argued that a centralized committee 
would be more efficient because 
the Department of Homeland Security 
would not have to answer questions 
from a lot of different committees. 
Well, it would also be more efficient if 
the Department did not have to respond 
to questions from a lot of different 
news outlets, but presumably 
The Post would argue that there are 
advantages to forcing the Department 
to respond to reporters with a variety 
of areas of expertise and a variety of 
perspectives. 

The Post certainly would not want 
the only news outlet to be an in-house 
publication. So I want to applaud the 
House leadership for doing what it has 
done, and I stand in strong support of 
this rules package. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. CARDIN). 

Mr. CARDIN. Mr. Speaker, the chairman 
of the Committee on Standards of 
Official Conduct is correct when he 
says that ethics reform must be bipartisan 
and if the House is to have meaningful 
bipartisan ethics process, 
changes of this magnitude can be 
made, as they were in 1997, only after 
thoughtful, careful consideration on a 
bipartisan basis. There has been no effort 
to look at the rules changes on 
ethics in a bipartisan manner. 

In 1997 when I co-chaired the Committee 
on Ethics Reform along with 
Bob Livingston, the changes that we 
made were done after deliberation, and 
after Democrats and Republicans, 
working together, came before the 
House and we did make major changes. 

And we instituted the 45-day rule for 
assigning a proper complaint for investigation; 
but we changed the rules in 
1997. We made it clear that you can 
move towards an informal investigation 
without a finding that it merits 
further inquiry or a resolution of preliminary 
inquiry because we did not 
want any matter of guilt or wrongdoing 
for the committee to be able to 
get the facts necessary to decide 
whether to go to formal investigation. 

Yet this rules change which would 
allow after 45 days inaction to dismiss 
a complaint makes inaction action, 
and it can be done on a very partisan 
basis. Now, that is wrong. That is not 
how it should be. 

The rules as they are currently configured 
in order to move a complaint 
past the committee, you have to have 
the bipartisan agreement of the committee 
because you have to have a vote 
in the committee. It guarantees a process 
will move forward in a bipartisan 
manner and, in fact, the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct has operated 
in a bipartisan manner because of 
the way the rules are configured. 

If this rule is changed, you are making 
it much more likely that the Committee 
on Standards of Official Conduct 
will act in a very partisan matter 
because they will be able to delay for 45 
days, which does not take a lot of effort 
to figure out how to delay for 45 
days. We have enough lawyers on the 
Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct that will be able to figure out 
that one. And it will be done on a partisan 
basis that will leave a cloud on 
the Member and a cloud on this institution. 
You should not have that in 
this rule. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield for the purpose of making a unanimous 
consent request to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. GEORGE 
MILLER). 

(Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California 
asked and was given permission to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 

Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
rules package. 

Every House Member should vote to put the 
House on record against ethical and procedural 
abuses that contaminate this institution. 

The stench of special interest corruption is 
overwhelming Congress, and repulsing the 
public. It is time the House Rules reflected the 
ethical standards and common sense of the 
American people. 

I came to this House 30 years ago, and our 
historic incoming class brought with it one of 
the strongest tides of reform ever seen: rules 
were changed, chairmen were replaced, procedures 
were modernized so that the voice of 
the people was heard, and respected, in this 
House of the people. 

Ten years ago, the Republicans took control 
of the House, promising a new era of reform. 
To read the national newspapers, it is evident 
to everyone—except themselves—that the Republicans 
have betrayed their promise of reform. 
They have tolerated misconduct and enshrined 
special interests as never before. 

Today, we give them, and all Members, an 
opportunity to restore public trust by voting for 


H20 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

two commonsense amendments to the House 
rules. 

First, no sitting Member should negotiate for 
a new job with any organization that has had 
business before his or her committee for a 
year. That’s not hard to understood: no one 
should be shaping public policy with an eye on 
a future private sector salary. 

Second, no bill should be brought to the 
House floor unless Members have had 3 days 
to read it first. That’s not hard to understand: 
we should not be passing bills that are hundreds 
of pages in length—sometimes over 
1,000 pages—without ever having seen what 
is in the bill. Ronald Reagan thought it was a 
bad idea; surely today’s House Republicans 
can agree. 

Let’s be honest about it: 99 percent of the 
American people outside the Beltway will 
agree with both of these principles—no negotiating 
for new jobs with special interests; Members 
should know what they are voting on before 
it becomes law. We shouldn’t even have 
to have a debate. But we do. 

Less than a month ago, the Nation was 
stunned to learn that the committee chairman 
who had fashioned a blatantly pro-drug industry, 
anti-senior, anti-consumer prescription 
drug law was retiring and taking a job with the 
pharmaceutical industry. In fact, our former 
colleague assumes his job with PhRMA today, 
just as we are taking our oaths of office. 

Mr. Tauzin will reportedly be earning a salary 
nearly 13 times what he earned when he 
wrote that pro-industry bill—one of the best 
paid lobbyists in Washington. 

He earned it. That prescription drug law will 
enrich him, but it takes billions of dollars out 
of the pockets of America’s senior citizens—by 
prohibiting them from purchasing cheaper 
drugs from Canada, and by prohibiting the 
Federal Government from negotiating with the 
pharmaceutical industry—his new employer— 
for lower drug prices. That’s worth billions to 
the drug industry. 

While the deal was not announced until last 
month, the discussions began a year ago, as 
was widely reported at the time. In fact, a top 
aide to the Republican leadership was quoted 
last January 24 on CNN.com as saying that 
Republican Congressman Tauzin’s negotiation 
with PhARMA ‘‘doesn’t look very good.’’ 

It doesn’t look ‘‘very good’’ today either, as 
millions of seniors face higher drug prices 
thanks to the Tauzin bill, and Bill Tauzin takes 
office to improve the tattered image of the 
drug industry. 

We all know this stinks. And so do our constituents. 
Let’s put an end to it today by barring 
negotiations for private jobs by Members 
of Congress. That’s what our constituents 
would want us to do. 

And at the same time, let’s put an end to 
the outrageous practice of voting on complex 
and lengthy bills before Congress has had 
time to read them—bills like that prescription 
drug bill Bill Tauzin wrote while he was listening 
to PhARMA’s whispers in his ears. 

Isn’t it bad enough that Republicans majority 
writes the bills in secret, without input from the 
Democrats who represent 48 percent of the 
country? Without scrutiny by the press? Without 
review by the public 

Must we also vote on secret legislation, 
without reading it, without knowing the tax 
breaks and earmarked spending for special interests 
that have been stuck in without any review? 


I urge all Members to put party aside and 
vote the way your constituents would want you 
to vote: an end to private job negotiations 
while serving in public office, and full disclosure 
of the contents of legislation before we 
vote. 

Mr. Speaker, I also vigorously oppose the 
proposed rule change that would allow an ethics 
investigation to end after 45 days of the 
Ethics Committee of five Democrats and five 
Republicans remained deadlocked. 

Today, the Republicans are once again putting 
partisan politicians ahead of ethics by 
moving forward with their plan to shield their 
embattled majority leader—TOM DELAY—from 
any further investigation. 

The goal of this change is to block the Ethics 
Committee from considering pending and 
future matters that could prove to be damaging 
to their party. 

Under the present rules, if the chair and the 
ranking minority member of the Ethics Committee 
cannot agree whether to investigate a 
complaint, the committee begins an initial investigation 
into the matter. 

But, under the Republicans’ proposed rule 
change, the Republican chairman of the Ethics 
Committee—who is handpicked by the Speaker—
could simply refuse to examine a complaint. 


After 45 days, the complaint would be 
dropped, without even an initial investigation 
into the matter. 

This new rule would allow Republicans to 
block pending ethics matters and prevent future 
investigations from moving forward. And 
the reason is very simple: there are at least 
two matters currently pending against Republican 
leaders, including Majority Leader TOM 
DELAY. 

Contrary to this morning’s press reports, the 
Republicans haven’t backed away from their 
attempts to shield DELAY from further investigation, 
they’ve simply become a little more 
deceptive in how they’re doing it. 

Last year, when the Ethics Committee admonished 
DELAY three times, it deferred action 
on another serious charge—his role in 
funneling illegal soft money into Texas races 
through his State PAC—until after the investigation 
against him had been completed. 

The rule change now proposed by his Republican 
colleagues would allow the Republican 
chairman of the committee to block any 
further investigation of DELAY’s activities, 
shielding the minority leader from further admonishments 
even if he is indicted by a grand 
jury. 

Also pending is an investigation of Republican 
lobbyist, Jack Abramoff, and former 
DELAY staffer, Michael Scanlon, and their ties 
to several Republican members. Changing the 
ethics rules would permit the Republicans to 
halt any investigation of the Abramoff scandal 
and the Members who could be implicated in 
their outrageous looting of Native Americans. 

I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this unbalanced and 
improper rules package. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. DELAHUNT). 

Mr. DELAHUNT. Mr. Speaker, we are 
making a terrible mistake here today 
by changing the rule in terms of the 
provision that would simply require no 
action after a 45-day period because, as 
the earlier speaker immediately preceding 
me indicated, what we will have 

done is change a nonpartisan committee 
that is based on a nonpartisan 
process into one that provides for a 
partisan veto over action where the behavior 
of an individual Member or 
Members is at question. That, I suggest 
and submit, is something that this institution 
will suffer from. 

There has been much discussion recently 
regarding this package. It was 
anticipated that there would be additional 
provisions that were not submitted 
today, but let us be clear what 
is at risk here. It is the confidence of 
the American people in the integrity of 
this institution. Perception, as we all 
know, is reality. And when the American 
people understand very clearly 
that we now have a Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct in which 
either side has a veto, it will undermine 
the confidence of the people in 
our ethical process. 

My question to the proponents would 
be, what is wrong with the current 
rules? We have operated on them. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 11/2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. GENE GREEN), a member 
of the Committee on Standards of 
Official Conduct. 

Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding me time. 

The gentlewoman is correct: I currently 
serve on the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct. And despite 
what I read in the morning papers, 
the Republican leadership is 
eliminating a major traditional ethics 
standard of the House. While we are relieved 
that the Republican leadership 
did not go as far as they wanted to, I do 
not think we can be happy with the 
trend that is clearly downwards as it is 
today. 

The new rule means no ethics violations 
will be investigated of party leaders, 
whether they be Republican or 
Democratic, control their members, 
since a tie vote means a dismissal. The 
logical result is more partisan political 
pressure on the committee members. 

America was intended to be a city on 
a hill with the highest standards for 
the government in the world; and 
sadly, today we are lowering those 
standards. 

The majority is proud of their political 
power and their skills at political 
games, and politics is an important 
part of our business; but principles 
must be held above politics because no 
man can serve two masters, both principles 
and politics. 

When we are guided by only political 
consideration in the House leadership 
today, the House abandons its principles 
and the moral compass. 

I do not enjoy serving on the committee. 
I do know something about legislative 
ethics, having first been elected 
to the State house of representatives 
after a tremendous Sharpstown 
bank scandal in Texas 1972. Born and 
raised in Texas, I understand what it 
means about conservative government, 
but I cannot begin to explain how 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H21 

eliminating a traditional ethics standard 
is conservative in the slightest. 

The House leadership can fool some 
of the people some of the time, like 
they did today when the papers said 
they were dropping ethics changes, 
when they clearly continue to weaken 
the standards. However, the people recognize 
this for what it is, a weakening 
of our government’s ethics in pursuit 
of political parity by one party, be it 
Democrat or Republican. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LOFGREN). 

Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the proposed changes in 
the ethics rules. 

I served for 8 years on the Committee 
on Standards of Official Conduct, and 
it is not an enviable assignment. But 
Members who have never served on the 
committee would be proud of how these 
tasks are approached. It is a committee 
that is evenly split. In the 8 years I 
served, we had unanimous votes. 

The Members who serve think about 
the institution. They are there to serve 
the American people and the institution. 
It has not been a partisan body. It 
has been one that holds other Members 
to a high ethical standard. These rules 
will undermine the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct, and the 
process of using the Committee on 
Rules rather than the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct to deliberate 
on the changes is also undercutting 
the Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct. 

I recommend that we do not support 
these rule changes. And I also want to 
mention on the homeland security provision 
of the rule, it is a huge mistake 
to ‘‘murky up’’ the jurisdiction over 
cybersecurity. We are at tremendous 
risk for a cyberattack, and the changes 
in that area will make us less safe. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. TAYLOR) 
for purposes of a colloquy. 

Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
California (Mr. DREIER) for yielding me 
time. 

Mr. Speaker, my question to the gentleman 
concerns the change to the 
rules that would allow Members to use 
campaign funds to purchase cell 
phones. As you know, there is a law 
that prohibits a Member of Congress 
from using the resources of their office 
or their office to solicit campaign 
funds. 

It is my hope that allowing campaign 
cell phones to be used in a congressional 
office is not in any way a back-
door attempt to allow a Member to use 
a campaign cell phone from their congressional 
office or any Federal facility 
to raise funds to get around this prohibition 
that currently exists in law. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield? 

Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. I yield 
to the gentleman from California. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I will be 
happy to respond to the gentleman. 

Let me say we are in the midst of a 
discussion about ethics at this point. 
Obviously, it is our goal to maintain 
the highest ethical standards. We have 
a law, which is actually a criminal law, 
which states that it is a violation of 18 

U.S. Code 607 for the solicitation of 
campaign contributions from Federal 
property. 
The idea behind this change that is 
included in this rules package is that 
Members should not be required to 
carry two separate cell phones with 
them. This would allow campaign funds 
to be used for the purchase of a cell 
phone that might be used for calling 
your office or other official purposes. 
But the law which prevents the solicitation 
of campaign contributions from 
Federal property in fact is maintained 
and is one we that feel very strongly 
about. 

Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. Just for 
a clarification, the use of a campaign 
cell phone in this building? 

Mr. DREIER. In any Federal building 
whatsoever. On Federal property is 
what the law says. It is a violation of 
the law. 

Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. To solicit 
campaign funds with a campaign 
cell phone. 

Mr. DREIER. It is a violation of the 
law. 

Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the minority 
leader. 

Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to what I consider a shameless 
rules package which will undermine 
the ethical standards held by this 
House. 

After the elections in November, the 
first thing the Republican majority did 
was to lower the House’s ethical standard. 
In an act of unprecedented shamelessness, 
they changed the rule of their 
party to permit an indicted member of 
their party to remain in a leadership 
position. Yesterday, in the face of an 
overwhelming bipartisan and public 
condemnation they changed their rules 
back. 

This is not shocking. What is shocking 
is that they ever considered it in 
the first place. Even more shocking, 
just if you think you have seen it all, 
is that the majority considered deleting 
the most fundamental of ethics 
rules which says that Members of the 
House should be held to the highest 
standards of ethical conduct. 

b 1615 
It says a Member shall conduct himself 
at all times in a manner that 
should reflect creditably on the House 
of Representatives. 
Dropping this rule is unthinkable. 
Yet Republicans only decided to keep 
it last night when the issue became too 
hot for them to handle. 
Thank heavens it became too hot for 
them to handle, but what is completely 

apparent to the public and those who 
follow the Congress is that the Republicans 
did not leave it at that. They 
went on to make new mistakes, to undermine 
the ethical standard of the 
House. 

Instead of a bipartisan effort to 
strengthen the ethical process, the Republicans 
have engaged in a completely 
partisan exercise that should be an affront 
to every Member on either side of 
the aisle who has served in this body. 
The proposed changes which are still in 
this rules package are destructive, and 
they are unethical. 

Mr. Speaker, I know of what I speak. 
I served on the Committee on Standards 
of Official Conduct for 6 years, and 
then for a seventh year I served as a 
part of the bipartisan committee to rewrite 
the ethics rules. It is bipartisan, 
evenly divided, and we came up with 
new ethics rules, some of which survived 
the floor that year in 1997. 

The package that was put together 
was meant to be fair to Members as 
well as uphold the high ethical standards. 
It says that Members should be 
judged by their actions and by the 
rules of the House and the law. So it 
was only about what took place, the 
facts and the law. It was not about 
rumor. It was not about hearsay. It was 
about the facts, the rules of the House 
and the law. 

There was a process which was fair to 
Members because, as I say, as someone 
who has 7 years on the ethical process, 
that it is very hard to make judgments 
about our peers. It is a very, very difficult 
task, and we want to be fair, but 
we have a higher responsibility to uphold 
that ethical standard. 

So it was put forth and has been the 
rules of the House and the Committee 
on Standards of Official Conduct that 
in order to cease or dismiss a case, we 
had to have a majority of the Committee 
on Standards of Official Conduct. 
That would be eliminated today. 
That would be eliminated today. 

So, on a partisan basis, there could 
be no cases that go forward. Either 
party with half the votes in the committee, 
evenly split, could cease and 
desist any complaints from going forward. 
That is simply not right. 

The point of the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct is to 
have a process in which to deal with 
ethics complaints against Members. 
The point of the Committee on Standards 
of Official Conduct is not to whitewash 
or to have a system that says 
nothing will ever move forward. 

What could the Republicans be afraid 
of that they would so fundamentally 
undermine the ethical process of the 
House to say we are going to establish 
a system where nothing will ever go 
forward? This simply is wrong. We owe 
it to the public, we owe it to each other 
to uphold that ethical standard. 

So, as I say, on the first day of this 
new Congress, the Republican majority 
is publicly demonstrating what has 
been evident for some time, and that is 
its arrogance, its pettiness, its shortsighted 
focus on their political life 


H22 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

rather than to decide how we are each 
of us fit to govern. 

Here is the thing. We have this rules 
package before us. They did some flash 
last night so that the press is saying, 
oh, they blinked. They did blink on a 
couple of different scores, but the fundamental 
challenge to the ethical 
standard of the House being enforced is 
still in this rules package, and it 
should be rejected. 

Democrats have made two proposals. 
One of them is to remove this change, 
and that would be a vote on the previous 
question, and then on the motion 
to recommit we address two other 
abuses of power that should be addressed 
in this bill. 

One is what I will call the Tauzin 
rule, and the Democratic motion to 
commit would forbid a Member of Congress 
to negotiate with an outside entity 
that has business before his or her 
committee and before the Congress, in 
the current Congress or in a previous 
Congress, called the Tauzin rule because 
Mr. Tauzin, who managed the 
Medicare bill, was at the time being 
courted by the pharmaceutical industry 
which was to benefit from provisions 
in the prescription drug bill, a rumored 
$2 million a year salary for selling 
America’s seniors down the river. 
That is simply wrong. Has this become 
an auction house? 

The public has to think and believe 
that when we are here and we are on 
the public payroll and we are Members 
of Congress that our accountability is 
to them and not to our next job. I call 
that the revolving door, shorthand for 
the Tauzin rule, and the impact of that 
is a very, very bad prescription drug 
bill that put pharmaceutical companies 
first, seniors last. 

In our motion to commit we also address 
the 3-day rule. As many of my 
colleagues recall in recent memory, 
there was occasion on the floor when a 
huge bill of many thousands of pages, 
containing nine appropriations bills, 
seven of which never appeared on the 
floor of the United States Senate, came 
before this House where the matter was 
overnight passed in the Committee on 
Rules, came to the floor the next morning 
without any chance of Members 
being able to read the bill. It came 
under the martial law rule the Republicans 
use by which they say we waive 
the 3-day rule by a simple majority. It 
should take two-thirds, but by a simple 
majority we waive the 3-day rule. Well, 
why was it important? It was important 
that day because there was a great 
deal in that bill that Members did not 
know about that they were voting on 
and should not they know that, but 
very specifically in that bill and it was 
not found out until the bill went to the 
Senate, who had more time to read the 
bill because it went over there several 
hours after it was heard here, and in 
that bill it said that the chairman of 
the Committee on Appropriations in 
the House and the Senate or his or her 
designee could look at the tax returns 
of American taxpayers. Where did that 

come in? It is a total orphan. It is a 
total orphan. No one was going to take 
responsibility for that. 

Because of the egregiousness of that 
and the violation of privacy of the 
American people, I insisted that the 
Members come back to vote on that 
rather than just have it be done by 
unanimous consent to remove that provision 
from the law. Why did I call 
Members back? So that the American 
people will know because of the abuse 
of power in this House, ignoring of the 
3-day rule, that Members cannot even 
see what they are voting on before they 
vote on it, and something like looking 
at your tax returns could be sneaked 
into the bill, without any safeguards to 
protect people from that. 

That is just one example. Another example 
is the Medicare prescription 
drug bill which came to the floor without 
proper time for review as well. The 
list goes on and on. 

In our motion to commit, we address 
the abuse of power of a powerful chairman, 
negotiating for a job while he was 
a Member of Congress, who had control 
of the bill over the industry, which was 
offering him $2 million a year. That is 
how much it cost to sell the American 
seniors down the river, and I hope that 
even if you separate yourself from any 
of the examples and just say I sent you 
to Congress to represent me, you do 
that in what you say there and how 
you vote, and I expect that you know 
what you are voting on. 

The message to the American people 
here this afternoon is a vote for the 
motion to commit, is a vote for Members 
to be able to read a bill before 
they vote on it. Is that asking too 
much? The Republicans say it is. So a 
yes vote on the motion to commit 
gives Members the 3 days which under 
the rules of the House they are entitled 
to. A vote for the motion to commit 
stops the unethical process of Members 
negotiating with people outside, whose 
bills they are managing inside this 
Congress, in this Congress or in the 
previous Congress. 

The previous question vote would say 
no to the Republicans in their evisceration 
of the ethical process of this 
House by saying that you do not need 
a majority to dismiss a case; you can 
just do it if all the Members of your 
party on the committee decide to stick 
with you on it. It is simply not right, 
and this should not be partisan. That is 
really what is really sad about it. 

Everything that we have done in the 
ethics process has had some level of respect 
to the extent that it has because 
it has been bipartisan, bipartisan in 
writing the rules, evenly divided committee, 
cooperation between the chair 
and ranking member. 

Today is a major departure from 
that, and I guess maybe I have just 
spent too many long hours for too 
many long years in the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct room 
trying to respect the rights of Members 
and our higher responsibility to uphold 
an ethical standard. To see the Repub


licans today run roughshod, rigging the 
rules, negotiating for jobs, no reading 
of the bill, it is an outrage. It is an absolute 
outrage. 

So I urge my colleagues to vote yes 
on the previous question, yes on the 
motion to commit, and by all means, 
however you vote on those, no on this 
very shameful rules package. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LAHOOD). The gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. SLAUGHTER) has 1 minute remaining. 


Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield for the purpose of making a unanimous 
consent request to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON-LEE). 

(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked 
and was given permission to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman 
because ethics equals integrity. 
I will submit my statement into 
the RECORD. Vote a resounding no on 
the resolution that is on the floor, and 
I hope that we will come before our 
peers and recognize that ethics equals 
integrity. 

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the proposed 
changes to the House Rules under the 
Privileged Resolution before the committee of 
the Whole House. Taken together, this package 
of proposals will gut the House Rules. 

Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
would like to completely gut and render ineffective 
the current Rule XI, which provides that 
a properly filed ethics complaint that has not 
been addressed by the Chair and Ranking 
Member of the Ethics Committee gets referred 
to an investigative committee. The Republican 
proposal would provide that, unless the committee 
votes by majority to take action on a 
properly filed complaint, no action will be 
taken after 45 days. 

This change to Rule XI would take away an 
important oversight power and allow partisan 
politics to kill legitimate and colorable ethics 
complaints. A change like this would be an 
embarrassment to what this nation calls a ‘‘democracy.’’ 
Furthermore, by allowing members 
to intentionally deadlock the vote of the Ethics 
Committee to kill a claim, we would be acting 
in contravention of the spirit of the U.S. Constitution 
that guarantees procedural due process. 


We should strengthen the House ethnics 
rules rather than eviscerate them for the 
American people whom we represent. Rules 
so relaxed that Members can negotiate with a 
corporation, lobbying firm, or trade association 
that has business before their committee 
should not be further stripped. The honor that 
was bestowed upon this House upon its establishment 
must be maintained. Members 
must be held accountable for their action. 

Moreover, Members should be given adequate 
time in which to read legislation that will 
be voted upon. Since the legislation that we 
pass in this august body affects the entire nation—
which includes the Districts represented 
by Minority Members, it is an injustice that insufficient 
time has been given for review of 
legislation. 

In the proposal that has been brought before 
the House does not contain the changes 
that are needed. It would be irresponsible for 
this body to accept what is before us. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H23 

The proposed Rule X amendment to create 
a Standing Committee on Homeland Security, 
on the other hand, is a smart one. It is only 
appropriate that this Committee be made permanent 
and be given jurisdiction over ‘‘overall 
homeland security policy.’’ Important organizational 
and admnistrative aspects of the Department 
of Homeland Security, DHS, require 
oversight to ensure effective and efficient operation. 


DHS is a conglomeration of 22 federal 
agencies with more than 180,000 employees 
and a budget of $36 billion. Because the Department 
is still in its infancy stages, it is critical 
that committee oversight be applied to 
track and quickly eradicate deficiencies. 

The Congress has just passed the National 
Intelligence Reform Act, or S. 2845, that will 
change the way our intelligence is collected 
and processed. DHS will be an important partner 
to our intelligence agencies in order to 
keep America safe. In addition, with the challenges 
that we have had with adequately funding 
first responders, it is very important that 
Congress retain a close relationship to the Department. 


Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rules package 
that is before this body, and I urge my colleagues 
to defeat it. I yield the balance of my 
time. Further, a rules change that changes the 
quorum for this body without a constitutional 
change is minimally undermining our constitutional 
values. 

Vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolution and ‘‘yea’’ on 
the motion to recommitt. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 

I urge every Member of this House to 
vote no on the previous question. If the 
previous question is defeated, I will 
offer an amendment to strike from the 
proposed rules package a provision 
that effectively guts our already ailing 
ethics process. This provision would 
halt the investigation of properly filed 
ethics complaints if, after 45 days, the 
chair and ranking Member of the Committee 
on Standards of Official Conduct 
have not set up an investigation 
committee. 

I urge the Members on both sides of 
the aisle to vote no on this previous 
question so we can delete this offensive 
provision. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
to insert the text of the amendment 
in the RECORD immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentlewoman 
from New York? 

There was no objection. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, after 
the vote on the previous question, I 
will call for a yes vote on the motion 
to commit. My motion to commit will 
prohibit sitting Members of Congress 
from negotiating for future employment 
with any person who has a direct 
interest in the legislation referred to 
any committee on which that Member 
serves. 

It also includes a rules change that 
would require a two-thirds vote in the 
House to waive the requirement in our 
standing rules that Members must 
have 3 days to read the committee reports. 


Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
to insert a statement as part of 
that immediately prior to the vote on 
the motion to commit. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentlewoman 
from New York? 

There was no objection. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge a no vote on the previous question. 


I call on all Members of this House, 
particularly the freshmen casting their 
first vote, please vote for ethics today. 
Do not vote against the Constitution. 
Vote for this House that you will love 
and revere as all of us do on both sides 
of the aisle. Please vote no on the previous 
question and vote yes on the motion 
to recommit. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 

b 1630 
Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Chair may 
reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time 
for electronic voting on the motion to 
commit and the vote on the adoption of 

H. Res. 5 if the votes immediately follow 
a 15-minute vote, notwithstanding 
intervening proceedings attending the 
administration of the oath of office to 
Members-elect. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LAHOOD). Is there objection to the request 
of the gentleman from California? 


There was no objection. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their remarks 
on this rules package. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from California? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 

Mr. Speaker, we have a great rules 
package that is coming before us, a 
rules package which I believe is deserving 
of bipartisan support. The reason I 
say it is deserving of bipartisan support 
is that is the word that has been 
used by Members on both sides of the 
aisle to describe exactly what we have 
been doing here and should be doing 
here. 

Mr. Speaker, this package includes a 
number of very important provisions. 
It allows us to deal with the prospect 
of a horrendous attack on this institution, 
and it allows us to continue this 
institution’s operations so the American 
people will understand that this 
institution stands even at a time of 
great crisis. This rules package allows 
for the establishment of a new permanent 
standing committee on homeland 
security, as the Speaker outlined in his 
opening remarks here today. I believe 
that is something that will allow 
Democrats and Republicans to spend 
time working on that issue. 

Mr. Speaker, this is a rules package 
which allows for bipartisan process at 

the ethics committee level. The Committee 
on Standards of Official Conduct 
is the committee which has the 
responsibility of working to ensure the 
integrity of all of the Members of this 
institution. The package we have before 
us does just that. 

I believe that the statement made by 
the chairman of the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct, the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. HEFLEY), is 
very clear. He understands that the 
provisions included in this package 
will in fact maintain the integrity of 
this institution. He was not going to 
support the earlier package; he is supporting 
this package. The issue of bipartisanship 
is important because in 
this package we ensure that we will 
not see the politicization of the ethics 
process which tragically we have seen 
in the past, because it will require bipartisanship, 
which all Members are 
talking about, if we do proceed with 
the investigatory process. 

That is the right thing to do, and I 
believe this package should in fact 
enjoy the support of Democrats and 
Republicans alike because it is designed 
to protect this institution and 
its Members. 

Mr. Speaker, the House is an institution built 
upon its rules. Accordingly, it is appropriate 
that one of the first orders of business of the 
109th Congress will be to adopt a rules package 
which is both true to its traditions and forward-
thinking in its outlook. 

The package we have before us represents 
the work product of many Members. During 
the initial stages of compiling this package, 
back in November, the Rules Committee received 
40 difference proposals form both 
Democrats and Republicans. 

In addition, our committee staff has actively 
sought the input of the officers of the House, 
its committees, and its caucuses to get their 
perspectives on the kinds of changes we can 
make to facilitate the work of the House. 

While not every proposal we received was 
incorporated into this package, I assure you 
that each received substantial consideration 
by the Speaker and the Rules Committee. 
And, as always, the Rules Committee will continue 
to review our rules and operations to see 
where other improvements can be made. 

Mr. Speaker, all of the ideals contained in 
this resolution reflect the considered judgment 
of our colleagues, and will ultimately improve 
our ability to carry out our constitutional responsibilities. 
While I will detail each of these 
changes in the section-by-section that I will 
place in the RECORD, I want to elaborate on 
just a few of these changes. 

The gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. JO 
ANN DAVIS) is the author of one important provision 
directing committees to review matters 
within their jurisdiction to ferret out duplicative 
government programs as part of their oversight 
planning at the beginning of each Congress. 


There are a number of instances where we 
are conforming the rules to reflect current 
House practice, such as with the designation 
of leadership members of the Budget Committee 
and the taking of recesses in committee 
to allow flexibility on our schedules. 

We are also making the ability to consider 
suspensions on Wednesdays permanent in 


H24 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

this Congress after our successful experiment 
in the 108th Congress. 

The package includes important provisions 
to allow us to function in situations where 
large numbers of Members are incapacitated. 
The ‘‘provisional quorum’’ language includes a 
number of safeguards to ensure that this institution 
can continue to operate during times of 
turmoil and democracy will be preserved. 

As we search for permanent solutions to the 
problems facing us in the post-9/11 era, this is 
an important step in meeting our responsibilities. 


We will also eliminate the Corrections Calendar. 
While this was originally intended to 
make it easier to consider legislation making 
corrections to outright errors in law, it turned 
out to be more cumbersome than other procedures, 
such as consideration under suspension 
of the rules. 

And yes, Mr. Speaker, in a change guaranteed 
to draw applause from my colleagues, 
the House rules will now allow us to make reference 
to the Senate and its Members, so 
long as those references are confined to the 
question under debate and avoid personality. 
The Senate has long had similar provisions 
and this new rule merely conforms our rules to 
theirs. 

I know that my colleagues and I share the 
desire to maintain our traditions of dignity and 
decorum in proceedings, and will do so even 
with this rules change. 

On another topic, the package makes a series 
of changes to our ethics rules. 

We included two provisions suggested by 
the chairman and ranking member of the 
Standards Committee: (1) clarifying the rule on 
officially connected travel to allow a family 
member other than a spouse or child to travel 
with the member at the sponsor’s expense, 
and (2) conforming the rules of the House to 
current law which allow the use of campaign 
funds to pay for certain official expenses, such 
as a cellphone. 

We also included provision suggested by 
the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. LARSON) 
to conform the rules of the House to current 
law with regard to the 90-day pre-election limit 
on franked mail. 

The package also includes two other provisions 
addressing our ethics rules. The first 
gives Members the same rights to choose 
their counsel before the Ethics Committee that 
they would enjoy if they were a respondent in 
a court case. 

The second change addresses an inequity 
in the Standards Committee process requiring 
an investigative subcommittee if the chairman 
and ranking member don’t act within 45 days. 
This change restores the presumption of innocence 
in our process. 

As important as each of those changes are, 
Mr. Speaker, perhaps the most important 
change in this resolution will be the creation of 
a new standing Committee on Homeland Security. 


It represents a far-reaching and critically important 
part of our overall strategic effort to 
protect the American people. The 9/11 Commission 
unanimously called for this action. 
They saw the need, and we believe most 
Members do, too. 

Over the past 3 years, the Congress has 
asked the American people to accept change 
in countless ways. We have mandated change 
at the Federal, State, and local levels. We 
have asked for change from our allies and 
forced change upon our enemies. 

And we saw the need for change over 2 
years ago, and we responded, first with the 
enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 
2002, and then with the formation of the Select 
Committee on Homeland Security. Their 
final report, a thorough and complete study of 
homeland security jurisdiction as it relates to 
House rules, was transmitted to my committee 
at the end of last year. 

These measures made it clear to me and 
many other Members that steps need to be 
taken to further ensure the safety of the American 
people. The Rules Committee thoroughly 
reviewed the Select Committee’s report and 
recommended a comprehensive and thoughtful 
reform effort that mirrors the recommendations 
of the 9/11 Commission: the formation of 
a permanent Committee on Homeland Security. 


This change in House rule X, which governs 
the committee and their legislative jurisdictions, 
is delicately crafted architecture. It 
draws to the new committee only jurisdiction 
directly related to our defense against terrorism. 
Thus, it creates a primary committee 
while recognizing the other legitimate oversight 
roles of existing committees. It acknowledges 
the expertise and experience residing in 
other committees and leaves with them jurisdiction 
that may have a homeland security implication 
but not a direct policy relationship. 

The House must have one central point 
where we, as national legislators, sort out the 
critical questions of securing our homeland 
without sacrificing our free society or a stable 
economy. 

However, we envision a system of ‘‘purposeful 
redundancy.’’ By that we mean more 
than one level of oversight and an atmosphere 
in which the competition of ideas is encouraged. 


With this jurisdiction and the legislative history 
that I will place in the RECORD, the Department 
of Homeland Security will have more 
certainty as to which committee has the primary 
responsibility for homeland security. At 
the same time, the American people will live 
with the assurance that we are working to prevent 
anything from falling through the cracks. 

Mr. Speaker, the new committee will have 
jurisdiction over: (1) Overall homeland security 
policy; (2) the organization and administration 
of the Department of Homeland Security; and 

(3) functions of the Department of Homeland 
Security relating to border and port security 
(except immigration policy and non-border enforcement), 
customs (except customs revenue), 
the integration, analysis, and dissemination 
of homeland security information, domestic 
preparedness for and collective response 
to terrorism, research and development, 
and transportation security. 
By approving this resolution, the House will 
do what the Speaker and the 9/11 Commission 
has asked it to do: consolidate jurisdiction 
of the House in one committee. This committee 
will be dedicated to setting national 
homeland security policy and to effectively 
overseeing that the Department of Homeland 
Security carries out its mission. 

Mr. Speaker, in making these changes, I 
want to note several points for the record. 

First, referrals to the Select Committee on 
Homeland Security in the 108th Congress will 
not be considered a precedent for referrals in 
the 109th Congress. 

Second, at the request of Mr. THOMAS, I am 
placing a document into the RECORD regarding 

understandings between the Department of 
Treasury and the Department of Homeland 
Security. 

Third, because the Department continues to 
evolve, references to a department, agency, 
bureau, office, or subdivision include a reference 
to successor entities to the extent that 
the successor engages in homeland security 
activities now conducted by the department, 
agency, bureau, office, or subdivision referred 
to in the legislative history. 

For example, the Homeland Security Act of 
2002 transferred the Office of Domestic Preparedness 
to the Department of Homeland 
Security, to ‘‘have the primary responsibility 
within the executive branch of Government for 
preparedness of the U.S. for acts of terrorism.’’ 
Subsequently, its name has been 
changed by the Department to ‘‘Office of State 
and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness 
(SLGCP)’’ although its mission 
stays the same. 

Finally, I welcome questions from my colleagues 
about jurisdictional matters related to 
this change. However, I want to caution all 
Members that referrals are solely within the 
Speaker’s power, and, in my answers, I will 
not infringe upon the power. 

Once again, I appreciate the input from all 
of you regarding the 109th rules package, and 
I feel that with your assistance, we will make 
the rules of the House stronger and make for 
a safer country. 

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose 
the changes in the House ethics rules that the 
Republican majority is seeking to adopt today. 
The proposed Republican rule changes would 
cripple the ethics process in the House and 
dramatically lower the bar for standards of official 
conduct. 

Late yesterday, the Republican majority in 
the House released the details of its rules 
package for the 109th Congress. Some of the 
newspapers reported this morning that the 
majority had abandoned its efforts to loosen 
rules governing Members’ ethical conduct, but 
this is not the case. While the majority backed 
away from some of its rule changes, the most 
egregious ethics change remains. This provision 
would make it much more difficult for the 
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to 
investigate allegations of wrongdoing by Members 
of the House. 

Under current rules, if the Ethics Committee 
deadlocks on whether or not to pursue an ethics 
complaint against a Member of the House, 
the matter automatically goes to an investigative 
subcommittee. Under the proposed 
change, a complaint against a Member would 
be tabled unless a majority votes to take action 
on it within 45 days. Since the committee 
is evenly split with five Republicans and five 
Democrats, either political party could simply 
block an ethics complaint by stonewalling and 
running out the clock. 

There is no doubt that if the proposed rule 
change had been in effect during the last Congress, 
no action would have been taken 
against the Members of the House who were 
reprimanded as a result of the Ethics Committee’s 
investigation of bribery allegations raised 
in connection with the vote on the Medicare 
Prescription Drug Act of 2003. The committee 
would have deadlocked and the entire matter 
swept under the rug 45 days after the complaint 
was made. 

I was listening to the debate on this earlier. 
The chairman of the Ethics Committee said 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H25 

that he does not favor this change. He said he 
would like it removed. Why then is the majority 
leadership pursuing this change, when it is opposed 
by the ranking Republican on the Ethics 
Committee? 

At a time when public confidence in Congress 
is so low and the Nation faces so many 
challenges, it is inexplicable that the first order 
of business in the new session is to water 
down the ethics rules in the House and make 
it even more difficult to discipline lawmakers 
who abuse their office. 

This should not be a partisan matter. The 
proposed rule change harms the integrity and 
credibility of the House as an institution, and 
that reflects badly on all of us, Republicans 
and Democrats alike. I urge all my colleagues 
to join me in opposing this assault on ethics 
enforcement in the House. 

Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to the rules package that we have before us 
today. 

It is outrageous that my Republican colleagues 
have placed before us a rules package 
that at best lacks integrity, and at worst is 
completely unethical. 

As the highest body of elected officials in 
our country, we should be held to the highest 
ethical standards. 

But instead, my Republican colleagues have 
opted to put before us a rules package that 
actually lowers our ethics standards, so that 
they may promote their own agenda, at whatever 
cost. 

This rules package makes it far more difficult 
for ethics investigations to take place. By 
requiring a majority of the ethics committee 
before an investigation can even begin, we 
are in great danger of diminishing the integrity 
of our great institution. 

With this new rule, the majority party can effectively 
block any ethics investigation of a 
member of their party. This is an abuse of 
power. 

And it’s not just Democrats who oppose this 
plan. Americans across the country have expressed 
their opposition to this plan. 

My Democratic colleagues and I have a better 
plan that will strengthen the ethics rules to 
improve congressional accountability and to 
make sure that legislation is properly considered. 


The Republican plan fails to close a loophole 
that allows legislation to be considered 
before members have read it. Last year this 
led to the passage of a provision that would 
have let the Federal Government deeply invade 
citizens’ privacy by reading their tax returns. 
I am appalled that the Republicans have 
failed to include the Democratic provision to 
tighten this loophole. 

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no’’ on the resolution, so that we do not allow 
this rules package to become law. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I am inserting for 
the RECORD the following legislative history regarding 
the changes made by this resolution 
to Rule X, along with supporting materials. 

LEGISLATIVE HISTORY TO ACCOMPANY 
CHANGES TO RULE X 

RULE X AND THE COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND 
SECURITY 

Legislative history 

Overall homeland security policy—The jurisdiction 
of the Committee on Homeland 
Security over ‘‘overall homeland security 
policy’’ is to be interpreted on a government-
wide or multi-agency basis similar to the 

Committee on Government Reform’s jurisdiction 
over ‘‘overall economy, efficiency, 
and management of government operations 
and activities. . . .’’ Surgical addresses of 
homeland security policy in sundry areas of 
jurisdiction occupied by other committees 
would not be referred to the Committee on 
Homeland Security on the basis of ‘‘overall’’ 
homeland security policy jurisdiction. For 
example, the Committee on Homeland Security 
shall have jurisdiction over a bill coordinating 
the homeland security efforts by 
all of the critical infrastructure protection 
sectors. Jurisdiction over a bill addressing 
the protection of a particular sector would 
lie with the committee otherwise having jurisdiction 
over that sector. 

Organization and administration of the Department 
of Homeland Security—The jurisdiction 
of the Committee on Homeland Security 
would apply only to organizational or 
administrative aspects of the Department 
where another committee’s jurisdiction did 
not clearly apply. The Committee’s jurisdiction 
is to be confined to organizational and 
administrative efforts and would not apply 
to programmatic efforts within the Department 
of Homeland Security within the jurisdiction 
of other committees. 

Homeland Security Oversight—This would 
vest the Committee on Homeland Security 
with oversight jurisdiction over the homeland 
security community of the United 
States. Nothing in this clause shall be construed 
as prohibiting or otherwise restricting 
the authority of any other committee to 
study and review homeland security activities 
to the extent that such activity directly 
affects a matter otherwise within the jurisdiction 
of that committee. 

Individual committee concerns 

Agriculture—The jurisdiction of the Committee 
on Homeland Security over ‘‘border 
and port security’’ shall be limited to agricultural 
importation and entry inspection 
activities of the Department of Homeland 
Security under section 421 of the Homeland 
Security Act of 2002. The Committee on Agriculture 
shall retain jurisdiction over animal 
and plant disease policy including the 
authority reserved to the Department of Agriculture 
to regulate policy under section 421 
of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and 
the Animal Health Protection Act, the Plant 
Protection Act, the Plant Quarantine Act, 
and the Agriculture Quarantine Inspection 
User Fee Account. The Committee on Agriculture 
shall retain jurisdiction over the agricultural 
research and diagnosis mission at 
the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. 

Armed Services—The Committee on Armed 
Services shall retain jurisdiction over 
warfighting, the military defense of the 
United States, and other military activities, 
including any military response to terrorism, 
pursuant to section 876 of the Homeland 
Security Act of 2002. 

Energy and Commerce—The Committee on 
Homeland Security shall have jurisdiction 
over measures that address the Department 
of Homeland Security’s activities for domestic 
preparedness and collective response to 
terrorism. The words ‘‘to terrorism’’ require 
a direct relation to terrorism. The Committee 
on Homeland Security’s jurisdiction 
over ‘‘collective response to terrorism’’ 
means that it shall receive referrals of bills 
addressing the Department of Homeland Security’s 
responsibilities for, and assistance 
to, first responders as a whole. The Committee 
on Energy and Commerce (and other 
relevant committees) shall retain their jurisdiction 
over bills addressing the separate entities 
that comprise the first responders. For 
example, the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce shall retain its jurisdiction over a 
bill directing the Department of Health and 

Human Services to train emergency medical 
personnel. 

Financial Services—The Committee on Financial 
Services shall retain jurisdiction 
over the National Flood Insurance Program 
and Emergency Food and Shelter Program of 
FEMA, and the Defense Production Act. The 
Committee on Financial Services shall retain 
its jurisdiction over the anti-money 
laundering, terrorist financing, and anti-
counterfeiting activities within the Department 
of the Treasury and the financial regulators. 


Government Reform—The Committee on 
Homeland Security shall have jurisdiction 
over ‘‘the organization and administration of 
the Department of Homeland Security.’’ The 
Committee on Government Reform shall retain 
jurisdiction over federal civil service, 
the overall economy, efficiency, and management 
of government operations and activities, 
including Federal procurement, and federal 
paperwork reduction. The Committee on 
Government Reform shall retain jurisdiction 
over government-wide information management 
efforts including the Federal Information 
Security Management Act. The Committee 
on Homeland Security shall have jurisdiction 
over integration, analysis, and dissemination 
of homeland security information 
by the Department of Homeland Security, 
and the Committee on Government Reform 
shall retain jurisdiction over measures 
addressing public information and records 
generally including the Privacy Act and the 
Freedom of Information Act. The Committee 
on Government Reform shall have jurisdiction 
over the policy coordination responsibilities 
of the Office of Counternarcotics 
Enforcement. 

Intelligence—The Permanent Select Committee 
on Intelligence shall retain jurisdiction 
over the intelligence and intelligence-
related activities of all departments and 
agencies of the Federal Government, including 
the Office of the Director of National Intelligence 
and the National Counter-
terrorism Center as defined in the Intelligence 
Reform and Terrorism Prevention 
Act of 2004. 

Judiciary—The Committee on the Judiciary 
shall retain jurisdiction over immigration 
policy and non-border enforceme4tn of 
the immigration laws. Its jurisdiction over 
immigration policy shall include matters 
such as the immigration and naturalization 
process, numbers of aliens (including immigrants 
and non-immigrants) allowed, classifications 
and lengths of allowable stay, the 
adjudication of immigration petitions and 
the requirements for the same, the domestic 
adjudication of immigration petitions and 
applications submitted to the Department of 
Labor or the Department of Homeland Security 
and setting policy with regard to visa 
issuance and acceptance. Its jurisdiction 
over non-border enforcement shall be limited 
to those aspects of immigration enforcement 
not associated with the immediate entry of 
individuals into the country, including those 
aspects of the Bureau of Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement. The Committee on 
Homeland Security shall have jurisdiction 
over border and port security including the 
immigration responsibilities of inspectors at 
ports of entry and the border patrol. As used 
in the new Rule X(1)(l)(9) and this legislative 
history, the word ‘‘immigration’’ shall be 
construed to include ‘‘naturalization’’ and no 
substantive change is intended by the new 
rule’s not containing the word ‘‘naturalization.’’ 


Science—The Committee on Science shall 
retain some jurisdiction over the research 
and development activities of the Department 
of Homeland Security as such matters 
are incidental to the Committee on Science’s 


H26 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

existing jurisdiction (except where those activities 
are in the jurisdiction of another 
committee). 

Transportation and Infrastructure—The 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
shall retain jurisdiction over the 
Coast Guard. However, the Committee on 
Homeland Security has jurisdiction over 
port security, and some Coast Guard responsibilities 
in that area will fall within the jurisdiction 
of both committees. Jurisdiction 
over emergency preparedness will be split between 
the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure and the Committee on Homeland 
Security. The Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure shall retain its jurisdiction 
under clause 1(r)(2) over ‘‘federal 
management of emergencies and natural disasters.’’ 
This means that the committee retains 
its general jurisdiction over the emergency 
preparedness and response operations 
of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA). Bills addressing FEMA’s 
general preparation for disaster from any 
cause shall be referred to the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure. The Committee 
on Homeland Security shall have jurisdiction 
over the Department of Homeland 
Security’s responsibilities with regard to 
emergency preparedness only as they relate 
to acts of terrorism. Thus, the Committee on 
Homeland Security shall have jurisdiction 
over the responsibilities of the Office for Domestic 
Preparedness, in accordance with section 
430 of the Homeland Security Act of 
2002. 

As indicated earlier, the Committee on 
Homeland Security’s jurisdiction over ‘‘collective 
response to terrorism’’ means that it 
would receive referrals of bills addressing 
the Department of Homeland Security’s responsibilities 
for, and assistance to, first responders 
as a whole and not over measures 
addressing first responder communities individually. 


The Committee on Homeland Security 
shall have jurisdiction over the functions of 
the Department of Homeland Security relating 
to transportation security, while the 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
shall retain its jurisdiction over 
transportation safety. In general, the Committee 
on Homeland Security would have jurisdiction 
over bills addressing the Transportation 
Security Administration and the 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
would have jurisdiction over bills 
addressing the various entities within the 
Department of Transportation having responsibility 
for transportation safety, such 
as the Federal Aviation Administration and 
the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. 
The jurisdiction of the Committee 
on Homeland Security does not include expenditures 
from trust funds under the jurisdiction 
of other committees, including but 
not limited to the Highway Trust Fund, the 
Airport and Airway Trust Fund, the Harbor 
Maintenance Trust Fund, the Federal Buildings 
Fund, and the Inland Waterways Trust 
Fund. 

Ways and Means—The jurisdiction of the 
Committee on Ways and Means over ‘‘customs 
revenue’’ is intended to include those 
functions contemplated in section 412(b)(2) of 
the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and includes 
those functions as carried out in collection 
districts and ports of entry and delivery. 


SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, 

Date: May 15, 2003. 

SUBJECT: Delegation from the Secretary 
of the Treasury to the Secretary of Homeland 
Security of general authority over Customs

412 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 
(Pub. L. 107–296) (Act), it is hereby ordered: 

1. Consistent with the transfer of the functions, 
personnel, assets, and liabilities of the 
United States Customs Service to the Department 
of Homeland Security as set forth 
in section 403(1) of the Act, there is hereby 
delegated to the Secretary of Homeland Security 
the authority related to the Customs 
revenue functions vested in the Secretary of 
the Treasury as set forth in sections 412 and 
415 of the Act, subject to the following exceptions 
and to paragraph 6 of this Delegation

the sole authority to approve any regulations 
concerning import quotas or trade 
bans, user fees, marking, labeling, copyright 
and trademark enforcement, and the completion 
of entry or substance of entry summary 
including duty assessment and collection, 
classification, valuation, application of the 

U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedules, eligibility 
or requirements for preferential trade programs, 
and the establishment of record-
keeping requirements relating thereto. The

Means and the Chairman and Ranking Member 
of the Committee on Finance every six 
months. The Secretary of the Treasury shall 
list any case where Treasury modified or revoked 
such a determination or ruling. 
(b) Paragraph 1(a) notwithstanding, if the

threat to public health and safety, the 
Secretary of Homeland Security may take 
action described in paragraph 1(a) without 
the prior approval of the Secretary of the

Ranking Member of the Committee on Finance 
the specific reasons therefor. The action 
shall terminate within 14 days or as

JOHN W. SNOW, 

Secretary of the Treasury. 

Mr. OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to H. Res. 5, to the Republican rules 
package. Specifically, I oppose the proposed 
changes to rule X, which among other things 
creates a permanent standing Committee on 
Homeland Security and grants legislative jurisdiction 
to that committee. I am not opposed to 
the creation of a permanent Homeland Security 
Committee. Indeed, I believe that the 
Homeland Security Committee should be 
made permanent and should be granted jurisdiction 
over the overall homeland security policy 
of the Federal Government. Further, I believe 
that a Homeland Security Committee is 
needed to oversee the internal administration 
of such a large Federal agency as the Department 
of Homeland Security, DHS, which has 
over 180,000 employees. 

Although H. Res. 5 includes these provisions, 
I oppose its grant of legislative jurisdiction 
to the new committee of areas that have 
previously been the jurisdiction of other committees. 
I oppose this grant of jurisdiction, not 
because of some desire to protect existing 
committees’ ‘‘turf’’, but because transfer of 
these security issues to a new committee divests 
from the responsibility for those issues 
from those Members who have substantial experience 
and expertise—in some cases developed 
through decades of work—on them. The 
existing committees are best equipped to give 
the full House the benefit of carefully thought 
out recommendations that provide effective 
security without unnecessary risks to safety or 
economic efficiency. It will take years for a 
new committee to be able to develop the expertise 
to provide the House and the Nation 
with reports and recommendations of the quality 
that existing committees provide. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H27 

It is not enough to say that members with 
particular areas of expertise will have an opportunity 
to be heard on these issues. The 
most effective way to influence policy is to be 
part of the debate and discussion in the early 
stages of policy formation; simply voting yes 
or no when legislation makes it to the House 
floor is generally not sufficient participation to 
craft policy. 

I take this position on the basis of my 30 
years of experience in the House, during 
which time I have given high priority to security, 
particularly the security of our transportation 
system. 

H. Res. 5 would divest responsibility for 
DHS’ transportation and port security functions 
from the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee, T&I Committee, and transfer it to 
the Homeland Security Committee. However, 
transportation and port security cannot be considered 
in a vacuum. Developing sound security 
legislation requires balancing security risks 
against the economic and safety impacts of 
such measures on transportation industries 
and their customers. For example, we would 
not want to install technology on aircraft to 
protect against missile attacks if that technology 
would create disproportionate safety 
risks. 
In addition, security mandates are only one 
type of requirement imposed on transportation 
industries. Other requirements include safety, 
consumer protection, environmental, accessibility, 
and competitiveness statutory or regulatory 
mandates. Any security legislation or 
regulation must be considered in the context 
of the costs and benefits of all such requirements 
governing transportation industries. 

The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
has the responsibility and the expertise 
to broadly consider security risks, weigh 
all costs and benefits of proposed requirements, 
and determine the likely effects of such 
actions on transportation industries, their customers, 
and the existing framework of other 
statutory and regulatory requirements. The T&I 
Committee, time and again, has proven it’s capable 
to ensure that the U.S. transportation 
system is efficient and safe, as well as secure. 
In the aftermath of the Pan Am Flight 103 
tragedy, the T&I Committee developed the 
landmark Aviation Security Improvement Act 
of 1990 (P.L. 101–604), which mandated 
background checks for airline and airport employees 
and the deployment of bomb detection 
equipment for baggage at our Nation’s airports. 
During the 1990s, our committee continued 
to respond to the changing security needs 
through oversight and legislation. 

In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, 
the T&I Committee developed and considered 
the Aviation and Transportation Security 
Act of 2001, ATSA. ATSA established a 
new Transportation Security Administration, 
TSA, federalized the screening workforce, and 
required the screening of all checked baggage 
to protect against terrorist threats. The Aviation 
Subcommittee alone has held 19 hearings 
on aviation security issues since September 

11. Since September 11, the T&I Committee 
has also spearheaded important maritime and 
port security legislation including the Maritime 
Transportation Security Act of 2002, and the 
Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act 
of 2004. 
The T&I Committee has the member expertise, 
the staff, and the institutional memory to 
deal with these issues. I believe that the qual


ity of congressional oversight and legislation 
on these issues will suffer if these issues are 
simply transferred wholesale to a new committee. 
It will take years for the new committee 
to develop the institutional background and expertise 
that currently resides in our committee. 

Finally, the Republican Conference drafted 
these changes to rule X in isolation. Democrats 
were afforded no role in crafting this critical 
security policy. 

I believe the proposed changes to rule X do 
not further the security of this Nation. Instead, 
I fear that they will hamper security by divesting 
from those Members with the experience 
and institutional knowledge of these issues the 
direct responsibility to craft security policy. 

For all of these reasons, I oppose H. Res. 
5. 

Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
that the rules package includes a provision 
that will make the Homeland Security Committee 
a permanent committee. More importantly, 
we will be giving the committee real 
oversight and legislative jurisdiction. But I am 
disappointed that the majority has only given 
shared jurisdiction to the Homeland Security 
Committee in some areas. This creates the 
potential for ongoing turf battles that the 9/11 
Commission warned against. 

I am also discouraged that the majority has 
decided to add a third day of suspension bills 
to the legislative calendar each week. An increasing 
amount of legislation is being passed 
by the House under a suspension of the 
Rules. This is unnecessary and keeps us from 
doing the real business of the House—budgeting, 
appropriations and oversight. 

A perfect example of this is the massive 
omnibus appropriations bill passed for fiscal 
year 2005 just a few weeks ago. This bill was 
rushed to the floor, ignoring the House rule requiring 
a 3-day review period before voting on 
conference reports. Only after the House 
voted on the bill, careful scrutiny of the language 
uncovered a provision allowing certain 
Members and staff access to any American’s 
tax return. 

Not only was this an embarrassing episode 
for the House leadership, it continued a troubling 
trend. In 4 out of the last 5 years, the 
majority has made a massive omnibus bill the 
only option to fund the government. This take-
it-or-leave-it approach is not acceptable and is 
fiscally irresponsible. 

Congress has also been asleep at the 
switch when it comes to funding for Iraq and 
the war on terrorism. This administration continues 
to fund the war on terrorism by supplemental 
appropriations. This is not a temporary 
war. Congress needs to stand up to this White 
House, stand up for honest budgeting, and require 
that funding for Iraq and the war on terrorism 
be made on-budget, and through the 
regular appropriations process. 

By appropriating through omnibus bills and 
budgeting by supplemental, Congress is surrendering 
its constitutional duties. The results 
of this practice are ballooning deficits—the 
CBO confirmed that the 2004 deficit is the 
largest in history, $413 billion—a lack of fol-
low-through to determine how appropriated 
funds are being spent. 

Without proper oversight as a backstop, 
problems in the executive branch can spin out 
of control. Members are learning about problems 
for the first time through the newspapers, 
not as a result of tough oversight hearings. 
This kind of lax or nonexistent oversight con


tributes to situations like we saw in Abu 
Ghraib prison. Now we have learned about secret, 
permanent detention facilities in the 
United States where possible terrorists are 
held indefinitely, without any legal status. 

Mr. Speaker, we need to take a hard look 
at our priorities and get back to doing the 
business of the House. We should be moving 
forward with a tough, focused oversight agenda, 
and a schedule that devotes more time to 
priority, must-pass legislation and less time to 
suspension bills. Instead, it appears that we 
are adopting a rules package today that will 
bring us more of the same. 

Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, as has been 
the case for a number of years, the rules 
package put forward by my Republican colleagues 
continues to trample on the rights of 
the minority. It will do nothing to stop the abusive 
practices in this House such as the 3-
hour vote on the Medicare bill in the middle of 
the night. In fact, it allows the Speaker added 
discretion to reconsider votes that the Republican 
majority loses. In addition, the new rules 
require an affirmative vote by the Ethics Committee 
before any action can be taken. This, in 
effect, gives my Republican colleagues the 
right to block any investigation. 

I would like to focus on one portion of the 
package that will create a permanent Committee 
on Homeland Security. While I am sure 
some of my colleagues believe that the new 
committee will improve our security, unfortunately 
this new committee will be nothing 
more than a costly addition to the expenditures 
of the legislative branch, and it will likely 
breed a new wave of ‘‘turf warfare’’ among the 
committees of the House. We simply do not 
need a special committee every time we face 
a crisis. 

The process under which we are being 
asked to approve this change is particularly 
troublesome. I call your attention to the last 
time the House felt compelled to create a new 
committee. In 1980, some Members of the 
House believed that it would be wise to create 
an energy committee. It used a careful process 
in which a committee on committees was 
created, consisting of Democrats and Republicans. 
When that committee reported its recommendations 
to the House, substitutes were 
permitted, and the result reflected a thoughtful 
understanding of how best to achieve the objectives. 


In contrast, we are now being asked to consider 
a proposal which was sent to us just 
yesterday. It was hatched in secret by our Republican 
colleagues without the input of any 
Democrats. While many of my Democratic colleagues 
may agree with the need for a new 
committee, the right of the minority to have 
their views considered and voted upon has 
been trampled once again. 

I also oppose the notion that a new committee 
is needed. If the main concern is one 
of oversight, we can use our existing committees 
to do the job. If Members still believed 
that a new committee was necessary, it need 
not have legislative jurisdiction. 

I am certain that is such a committee had 
legislative recommendations of merit, the appropriate 
committees along with proper actions 
by respective party leaders would ensure the 
bill would come to the floor. 

Instead, I foresee a new committee that will 
seek to increase its powers by introducing bills 
granting all manner of new authorities to the 
Department of Homeland Security. In addition, 


H28 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

thoughtful bills addressing aspects of homeland 
security reported by the existing committees 
will now be delayed as the new committee 
will seek referrals. And needed responsiveness 
by the executive branch to the existing 
committees may be hindered. 

While the 9/11 Commission urged a reorganization 
of congressional committees to deal 
with homeland security, it is odd that this new 
committee will have no jurisdiction over the 
issues that were identified by the Commission 
that led to the 9/11 tragedy. The new committee 
will have no jurisdiction over the intelligence 
community, the law enforcement community, 
or immigration enforcement. 

It is a shame that the first day of this new 
Congress should be marked by an attempt to 
authorize a new committee without so much 
as an open markup to consider its merits. 
Moreover, it would be extremely unwise to ignore 
the expertise and experience of existing 
committees as we address homeland security 
issues, but we are starting down that path 
today. 

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I 
strongly oppose the radical new provision included 
in this rules package resolution which 
would violate the Constitution by allowing the 
Speaker and a small group of Members to 
usurp the powers of a majority of the House 
and act with only a ‘‘provisional quorum’’ instead 
of the real thing. 

The proposal would deny the plain language 
of section 5 of article I of the Constitution and 
create a new category of quorum—a ‘‘provisional 
quorum’’—which the Constitution expressly 
forbids. It destroys the very idea of the 
quorum. It would also demolish a 99-year-old 
precedent, based on the Constitution, that a 
quorum of the House consists of a majority of 
the membership chosen, sworn, and living. 

For each House Member deprived of the 
right to exert an impact on the work of the 
House, either through physical presence in or 
absence from the Chamber, the approximately 
600,000 persons represented by each Member 
would be deprived of their rights to democratic 
representation in the legislative body 
structured to be closest to the American people. 
This proposal transfers the rights of those 
‘‘closest to the people’’ to those closest to the 
House floor. 

The proposal takes the guise of a rules 
change which the House has no power to 
pass, since the Constitution determines what 
kind of body the House is, and what it can— 
and can not—do. 

Under this proposal, a majority of Members 
of the House could be alive and well and fully 
cognizant, but unable to reach the floor, while 
the few who are present could usurp their authority 
and the powers of the House. 

Article I, section 5 of the Constitution states 
that a quorum consists of a majority, and, in 
the absence of a majority, all that the remaining 
minority of Members of the House can do 
is either adjourn from day to day or vote to 
compel the attendance of absent Members. 
There are no other options—no matter how inconvenient 
that fact may be for any faction on 
the floor of the House during a time of emergency. 


The fact that the Constitution authorizes a 
minority to compel the attendance of the absentees 
clearly indicates that the absentees 
are needed to conduct business. The Constitution 
does not guarantee that a minority of 
the House will necessarily succeed in compel


ling the attendance of absent Members to create 
a constitutional quorum. And such a result 
could indeed cause a crisis, which H. Res. 5 
would do nothing to remedy. Unfortunately, 
during the last Congress the House refused to 
make serious progress toward ensuring continuity 
of government. 

Let’s consider how the plan before us today 
actually might operate. 

Suppose that, in the aftermath of a catastrophic 
emergency which caused mass casualties 
and disrupted transportation and communications 
nationwide, a presiding officer existed 
in the House who might either be the 
Speaker or another Member of the House acting 
as ‘‘Speaker pro tempore’’ from a list of 
names left by a deceased Speaker. 

Suppose that the presiding officer decided, 
if a quorum of the majority of Members failed 
to appear within a specified time period, that 
Members who weren’t present on the House 
floor or any other designated place of meeting 
ceased to be Members for purposes of determining 
a quorum. 

Suppose the rump minority of Members who 
had managed to reach the floor wanted to 
pass major legislation, including a declaration 
of war or authorization for use of military force, 
send constitutional amendments to the States 
for ratification, expel Members from their 
seats, or elect a new Speaker to become Acting 
President of the United States, all using a 
‘‘provisional quorum’’ of one-half of the Members 
present, plus one. 

Could they do these things? The proposed 
rule says they could. The Constitution says 
they could not. 

The resolution gives the Member presiding 
the effective power to temporarily define out of 
existence those Members who don’t respond 
to a specified series of quorum calls. These 
Members’ seats would not be considered vacant, 
but they would fall into a kind of extra-
constitutional limbo until the missing Members—
or a majority of the total membership— 
reappeared in the House. It is even possible 
that some states might seek to replace Members 
who do not answer the ‘‘provisional 
quorum’’ call in the House by ordering special 
elections even though the Members might be 
known to be alive. 

All Members are equal under the Constitution, 
and the right to membership in this 
House is not determined by a Speaker, 
Speaker pro tempore, or a rump of a minority 
of the body. It is determined by a vote of the 
people, and only a constitutionally constituted 
House may exercise the power to determine 
the qualifications of its Members and whether 
they have been duly elected. 

The Supreme Court has ruled that the 
House may not add qualifications for membership 
beyond those expressly stated in the 
Constitution. If a Member has been duly elected 
and taken the oath, he remains a Member, 
and can only be removed through resignation, 
or through expulsion. There is no constitutional 
requirement that a Member must appear 
on the floor to maintain membership, or that 
House membership can somehow lapse. 

It is surprising that some who only last year 
during debate on the ‘‘Continuity of Representation 
Act’’, H.R. 2844, spoke eloquently about 
the status of a House consisting only of Members 
elected by the people are now supporting 
a proposal to define those elected Members 
out of existence. 

Members who are trapped at an airport because 
the transportation system is inoperative, 

for example, do not simply cease to exist, nor 
can their powers be vested in other Members, 
willingly or not. Their absence has potential 
consequences, including the inability of the 
House to act until the collective body is ‘‘assembled’’ 
again, as the Constitution requires. 

The resolution would also do an end run 
around the issue of ‘‘disability’’, a matter not 
addressed in the Constitution and one which 
requires a constitutional amendment to resolve, 
as the 25th Amendment did in the case 
of the President. Disabled Members—whom 
we might describe as those either physically 
injured or mentally incapable so as to be incapable 
of participating in the work of the 
House—have the same status as those who 
are fully functional. The Constitution makes no 
mention of disabled Members, but it does not 
give the House the power to pretend they 
don’t exist. The House has never expelled or 
otherwise attempted to remove a sitting Member 
on the grounds of disability. 

Proponents of the proposal before us today 
claim to address the problem of incapacitated 
Members, but only by effectively ignoring it. 
Under the provisional quorum rule, these 
Members would presumably not be able to appear 
on the floor and would be automatically 
excluded from the provisional quorum. It’s a 
very convenient solution to the disability problem, 
though blatantly unconstitutional. 

The House could adopt the provisional 
quorum plan as a House rule if the Constitution 
were amended to authorize it to do so; 
however, the Constitution does not. 

The argument that the House is somehow 
exercising a constitutional power to make its 
own rules is also spurious. The House may 
only make rules which the Constitution permits 
it to make. The House may not reinvent itself 
at will as a different kind of legislative body by 
pretending that it is simply changing its rules. 

At the very least, the House should debate 
the provisional quorum issue as a separate 
resolution, following hearings by the Rules 
Committee, with the Speaker in the chair to 
signal the historic nature of the debate and the 
radical action proposed to be taken. Burying 
the issue within this resolution with other controversial 
rule changes is an outrage. 

The 108th Congress proved to be a huge 
disappointment because of its failure to effectively 
address many issues involving the stability 
of our structure of government, deficiencies 
brought to the forefront by the September 
11 attacks, as well as a disturbing 
tendency to paper over controversies with legislation 
which fails to substantively address the 
problem. 

For example, the House rejected a constitutional 
amendment offered by Representative 
BAIRD of Washington which would have reconstituted 
the House quickly through temporary 
appointments, pending special elections, if a 
large number of Members were killed. I had 
introduced a different version of the proposal, 

H.J. Res. 89. Members opposed to the concept—
which is admittedly extremely controversial—
refused to allow real hearings and debate. 
Even though prospects for passage of a 
constitutional amendment were extremely slim, 
a substantial debate would have served to 
educate the Congress and the American people 
on the importance of these issues, and 
perhaps provide impetus in a search for alternatives. 
A major effort like this has to start 
somewhere. 
Instead, the House passed, but the Senate 
subsequently did not consider, H.R. 2844, the 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H29 

‘‘Continuity of Representation Act’’, which created 
an unrealistically fast, unfair, undemocratic 
and unworkable scheme to fill vacant 
House seats through a mandatory national 45-
day special election period. This bill was referred 
principally to the House Administration 
Committee, where I was able to make an official 
record of its many flaws. 

Neither House passed simple legislation 
which would have corrected an oversight in 
the legislation creating the Department of 
Homeland Security in 2002, which failed to 
place the supposedly critical new cabinet officer 
somewhere—anywhere—in the statutory 
line of success to the Presidency. 

Though hearings were held, neither House 
addressed significant issues of Presidential 
succession, such as the role of the Speaker 
and President pro tempore and lame duck 
Cabinet members in the succession lineup, 
and the ability of some officials to ‘‘bump’’ others 
serving as acting president under the current 
Federal statute. 

Mr. Speaker, I plan to urge further action on 
congressional continuity issues in the new 
year, to work with my colleagues on the Committee 
on House Administration to assert our 
own jurisdiction more effectively and to push 
other relevant committees to do the same. We 
need both more effective action, and better internal 
cooperation, to accomplish these goals. 

The material previously referred to 
by Ms. SLAUGHTER is as follows: 
EXPLANATION OF 3-DAY LAYOVER 
SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENT 

1. Committee Reports. Clause 4(a)(1) of 
Rule XIII requires committee-reported bills 
to lay over for three days before consideration 
in the House. The purpose of this rule, 
which dates from the legislative Reorganization 
Act of 1970, is to give Members who did 
not participate in committee deliberations 
time to consider the committee’s work. The 
three-day layover period gives Members time 
to familiarize themselves with the legislation 
and to prepare for House debate, which 
could include drafting amendments to the 
committee-reported bill. When he was a minority 
Rules Committee Member, Chairman 
Dreier explained the importance of this rule 
in the following way: 
‘‘Why is it that we have the 3-day layover? 
Very simple, Mr. Speaker, I do not think you 
would enter into a business agreement or 
purchase a home or engage in any kind of 
major activity without having read it first. 
The idea behind the 3-day layover is very 
simple. It is there so that we may in fact 
allow Members to have the opportunity to 
review legislation before they exercise their 
constitutional right and vote for it or 
against it.’’ 

Althoug Chairman Dreier was very critical 
of special rules that waived the 3-day layover 
when he was a minority Rules Committee 
member, his committee routinely reports 
special rules waiving 3-day layover of committee-
reported legislation. In the 108th Congress, 
the Rules Committee waived the 3-day 
layover of committee-reported legislation 31 
times. 

The purpose of this amendment is to restore 
regular order to the committee reporting 
process. It would allow the House to 
adopt a rule waiving the 3-day layover of 
committee-reported legislation only with a 
two-thirds vote—in the same way the House 
must approve a rule calling for same-day 
consideration of a bill by a two-thirds vote. 

2. Conference Reports. House-Senate conferences 
are a critical part of the Congressional 
deliberative process because they 
produce the final legislative product that becomes 
the law of the land. The conference is 
where the final compromises are made and 
the final statutory language on the bill’s 
toughest issues is negotiated and drafted. As 
Chairman Dreier wrote back in 1993: 

‘‘Deliberative democracy is just as important 
at the end of the legislative process as 
it is at the formative subcommittee stages 
or the amendatory floor stage. In fact, the 
case can be made that it is even more important 
that Congress be fully informed and deliberate 
on that final product since that is 
the version that will become law.’’ 

Because only a restricted group of House 
Members participate in conferences and because 
conference reports can contain significant 
policy changes from the House-approved 
version of a bill, the standing House Rules 
provide Members a number of protections 
against the conference process. Perhaps the 
most important protection is the one found 
in clause 8(a)(1)(A) of House Rules XXII, 
which requires conference reports and joint 
explanatory statements to lay over for three 
days after publication in the Congressional 
Record. The purpose of this rule is very 
clear. Since most Members do not participate 
in the conference, they need time to 
study and familiarize themselves with the 
conference product. Conference reports on 
major legislation run sometimes hundreds of 
pages and often contain small, technical-
looking changes in bill language that can 
have large policy effects. They can also contain 
provisions that serve the interests of a 
small group of conferees, but do not reflect 
the intentions of the broader house membership. 


Although conference reports are privileged 
and could come directly to the Floor for consideration 
without a rule, they are routinely 
considered under special rules because they 
are often in technical violation of one or 
more sections of Rule XXII or the Budget 
Act of 1974. While it is understandable that 
the majority may need to use special rules to 
waive certain points of order against the 
content or consideration of conference reports 
in particular situations, the Majority 
has made it the practice to grant ‘‘blanket 
waivers’’ to virtually every conference report 
the House considers. Twenty-five of the 
28 special rules the Rules Committee granted 
on conference reports in the 108th Congress 
waived 3-day layover. In other words, it has 
become standard practice to jam conference 
reports through the House before most Members 
know what is in them. 

One of the troubling consequences of this 
policy is that Members only learn about the 
details of a conference report after it has already 
passed the House. Some of these conference 
reports reconfirm the truth of the 
old saying that ‘‘the devil is in the details.’’ 
Chairman Dreier made this very same argument, 
when, as a minority Rules Committee 
member, he opposed waiving the 3-day layover 
on conference reports. He wrote: 

‘‘The House and Senate have been repeatedly 
embarrassed over the years by conference 
reports on voluminous pieces of legislation 
which have been voted on before 
even properly printed or distributed, let 
alone understood. Only after their enactment 
have some of the provisions come back 
to haunt the Congress.’’ 

The 108th Congress has had its share of embarrassing 
episodes involving the quick approval 
of conference reports that were later 
discovered to contain controversial provisions 
added into bills during the conference 
stage. For example: 

One of the earliest actions of the 108th 
Congress was to repeal the embarrassing provision 
Republican leaders had slipped into 
the Homeland Security conference report at 
the end of the 107th Congress that protected 
Eli Lilly and a number of other pharma


ceutical companies from civil liability for 
their production of the vaccine preservative 
Thimerosal. 

The Energy Bill conference added scores of 
obscure provisions that had not appeared in 
the House or Senate bills, including the embarrassing 
‘‘greenbonds initiative,’’ which 
turned out to be subsidy to build a Hooters 
restaurant in Shreveport, Louisiana. 

The recent conference report for the FY05 
Omnibus funding bill included a provision 
giving Appropriations Committee Members 
and staff access to the Internal Revenue 
Service tax returns of U.S. Citizens. 

To avoid future embarrassing episodes 
such as these and to restore Members’ rights 
to have three days to study a conference report, 
this section would allow the House to 
adopt a rule waiving the 3-day layover of 
conference report only with a two-thirds 
vote.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair customarily takes this occasion 
on the opening day of Congress to announce 
his policies with respect to particular 
aspects of process. The Chair 
will insert in the RECORD announcements 
by the Speaker concerning: 
privileges of the floor; introduction of 
bills and resolutions; unanimous-consent 
requests for the consideration of 
bills and resolutions; recognition for 1-
minute speeches, morning-hour debate, 
and special orders; decorum in debate; 
conduct of votes by electronic device; 
distribution of written materials on 
the House floor; use of wireless telephones 
or personal computers on the 
House floor; and jurisdictional issues. 

These announcements, where appropriate, 
will reiterate the origins of the 
stated policies. The Speaker intends to 
continue in the 109th Congress the policies 
reflected in these statements. 

The announcements referred to follow 
and, without objection, will be 
printed in the RECORD January 4, 2005: 

There was no objection. 

1. PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR 
The Chair will make the following announcements 
regarding floor privileges, 
which will apply during the 109th Congress. 

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT 
TO STAFF 

The SPEAKER. Rule IV strictly limits those 
persons to whom the privileges of the floor 

during sessions of the House are extended, 
and that rule prohibits the Chair from entertaining 
requests for suspension or waiver of 
that rule. As reiterated by the Chair on January 
21, 1986, January 3, 1985, January 25, 
1983, and August 22, 1974, and as stated in 
Chapter 10, section 2, of House Practice, the 
rule strictly limits the number of committee 
staff on the floor at one time during the consideration 
of measures reported from their 
committees. This permission does not extend 
to Members’ personal staff except when a 
Member’s amendment is actually pending 
during the five-minute rule. It also does not 
extend to personal staff of Members who are 
sponsors of pending bills or who are engaging 
in special orders. The Chair requests the cooperation 
of all Members and committee 
staff to assure that only the proper number 
of staff are on the floor, and then only during 
the consideration of measures within the 
jurisdiction of their committees. The Chair 
is making this statement and reiterating 
this policy because an increasing number of 
Members have insisted on strict enforcement 
of the rule. The Chair requests each chairman, 
and each ranking minority member, to 
submit to the Speaker a list of those staff 
who are allowed on the floor during the consideration 
of a measure reported by their 
committee. The Sergeant-at-Arms, who has 
been directed to assure proper enforcement 
of rule IV, will keep the list. Each staff person 
should exchange his or her ID for a 
‘‘committee staff’’ badge, which is to be 
worn while on the floor. The Chair has consulted 
with the Minority Leader and will 
continue to consult with her. 

Furthermore, as the Chair announced on 
January 7, 2003, in accordance with the 
change in the 108th Congress of clause 2(a) of 
rule IV regarding leadership staff floor access, 
only designated staff approved by the 
Speaker shall be granted the privilege of the 
floor. The Speaker intends that his approval 
be narrowly granted on a bipartisan basis to 
staff from the majority and minority side 
and only to those staff essential to floor activities. 


ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT 
TO FORMER MEMBERS 

The SPEAKER. The guidelines announced by 
the Chair on August 1, 1996, and May 25, 1995, 
with respect to the prohibition against 
former Members exercising floor privileges 
during the consideration of a matter in 
which they have a personal or pecuniary interest 
or are employed or retained as a lobbyist 
will continue to apply in the 109th Congress. 


Clause 4 of rule IV and the subsequent 
guidelines issued by previous Speakers on 
this matter make it clear that consideration 
of legislative measures is not limited solely 
to those pending before the House. Consideration 
also includes all bills and resolutions 
that have been called up by a full committee 
or subcommittee or on which hearings have 
been held by a full committee or subcommittee 
of the House. 

Former Members can be prohibited from 
privileges of the floor, the Speaker’s lobby, 
and respective Cloakrooms should it be 
ascertained they have a direct interest in 
legislation that is before a subcommittee, 
full committee, or the House. Not only do 
those circumstances prohibit former Members 
but the fact that a former Member is 
employed or retained by a lobbying organization 
attempting to directly or indirectly influence 
pending legislation is cause for prohibiting 
access to the House Chamber. First 
announced by Speaker O’Neill on January 6, 
1977, again on June 7, 1978, and by Speaker 
Foley in 1994, the guidelines were intended to 
prohibit former Members from using their 
floor privileges under the restrictions laid 


H34 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

out in this rule. This restriction extends not 
only to the House floor but adjacent rooms, 
the Cloakrooms, and the Speaker’s lobby. 

Members who have reason to know that a 
former Member is on the floor inconsistent 
with clause 4 of rule IV should notify the 
Sergeant-at-Arms promptly. 

2. INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS 
The SPEAKER. The policy that the Chair 
announced on January 3, 1983, with respect 
to the introduction and reference of bills and 
resolutions will continue to apply in the 
109th Congress. As Members are aware, they 
have the privilege today of introducing bills. 
Heretofore on the opening day of a new Congress, 
several hundred bills have been introduced. 
The Chair will do his best to refer as 
many bills as possible, but he will ask the indulgence 
of Members if he is unable to refer 
all the bills that may be introduced. Those 
bills that are not referred and do not appear 
in the Record as of today will be included in 
the next day’s Record and printed with a 
date as of today. 
The Chair has advised all officers and employees 
of the House that are involved in the 
processing of bills that every bill, resolution, 
memorial, petition or other material that is 
placed in the hopper must bear the signature 
of a Member. Where a bill or resolution is 
jointly sponsored, the signature must be 
that of the Member first named thereon. The 
bill clerk is instructed to return to the Member 
any bill which appears in the hopper 
without an original signature. This procedure 
was inaugurated in the 92d Congress. It 
has worked well, and the Chair thinks that it 
is essential to continue this practice to insure 
the integrity of the process by which 
legislation is introduced in the House. 

3. UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUESTS FOR THE 
CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION 
The SPEAKER. The policy the Chair announced 
on January 6, 1999, with respect to 
recognition for unanimous consent requests 
for the consideration of certain legislative 
measures will continue to apply in the 109th 
Congress. The Speaker will continue to follow 
the guidelines recorded in section 956 of 
the House Rules and Manual conferring recognition 
for unanimous-consent requests for 
the consideration of bills, resolutions, and 
other measures only when assured that the 
majority and minority floor leadership and 
committee chairmen and ranking minority 
members have no objection. Consistent with 
those guidelines, and with the Chair’s inherent 
power of recognition under clause 2 of 
rule XVII, the Chair, and any occupant of the 
Chair appointed as Speaker pro tempore pursuant 
to clause 8 of rule I, will decline recognition 
for the unanimous-consent requests 
chronicled in section 956 without assurances 
that the request has been so cleared. This denial 
of recognition by the Chair will not reflect 
necessarily any personal opposition on 
the part of the Chair to orderly consideration 
of the matter in question, but will reflect 
the determination upon the part of the 
Chair that orderly procedures will be followed; 
that is, procedures involving consultation 
and agreement between floor and 
committee leadership on both sides of the 
aisle. 

4. RECOGNITION FOR ONE-MINUTE SPEECHES 
AND SPECIAL ORDERS 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT 
TO ONE-MINUTE SPEECHES 

The SPEAKER. The Speaker’s policy announced 
on August 8, 1984, with respect to 
recognition for one-minute speeches will 
apply during the 109th Congress. The Chair 
will alternate recognition for one-minute 
speeches between majority and minority 
Members, in the order in which they seek 
recognition in the well under present prac


tice from the Chair’s right to the Chair’s 
left, with possible exceptions for Members of 
the leadership and Members having business 
requests. The Chair, of course, reserves the 
right to limit one-minute speeches to a certain 
period of time or to a special place in 
the program on any given day, with notice to 
the leadership. 

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT 
TO SPECIAL-ORDER SPEECHES 

The SPEAKER. The Speaker’s policy announced 
on February 11, 1994, and February 
24, 1994, with respect to restricted special-
order speeches, will also continue through 
the 109th Congress with the further clarification 
that reallocations of time within each 
leadership special-order period will be permitted 
with notice to the Chair. Upon consultation 
with the Minority Leader, the 
Speaker’s policy, which began on February 
23, 1994, was reiterated on January 4, 1995, 
and was supplemented on January 3, 2001, 
will continue to apply in the 109th Congress 
as outlined below: 

On Tuesdays, following legislative business, 
the Chair may recognize Members for 
special-order speeches up to midnight, and 
such speeches may not extend beyond midnight. 
On all other days of the week, the 
Chair may recognize Members for special-
order speeches up to four hours after the 
conclusion of five-minute special-order 
speeches. Such speeches may not extend beyond 
the four-hour limit without the permission 
of the Chair, which may be granted only 
with advance consultation between the leaderships 
and notification to the House. However, 
at no time shall the Chair recognize for 
any special-order speeches beyond midnight. 

The Chair will first recognize Members for 
five-minute special-order speeches, alternating 
initially and subsequently between 
the parties regardless of the date the order 
was granted by the House. The Chair will 
then recognize longer special orders speeches. 
A Member recognized for a five-minute 
special-order speech may not be recognized 
for a longer special-order speech. The four-
hour limitation will be divided between the 
majority and minority parties. Each party is 
entitled to reserve its first hour for respective 
leaderships or their designees. Recognition 
will alternate initially and subsequently 
between the parties each day. 

The allocation of time within each party’s 
two-hour period (or shorter period if prorated 
to end by midnight) is to be determined 
by a list submitted to the Chair by 
the respective leaderships. Members may not 
sign up with their leadership for any special-
order speeches earlier than one week prior to 
the special order, and additional guidelines 
may be established for such sign-ups by the 
respective leaderships. 

Pursuant to clause 2(a) of rule V, the television 
cameras will not pan the Chamber, 
but a ‘‘crawl’’ indicating morning hour or 
that the House has completed its legislative 
business and is proceeding with special-order 
speeches will appear on the screen. The Chair 
may announce other television camera adaptations 
during this period. 

The continuation of this format for recognition 
by the Speaker is without prejudice 
to the Speaker’s ultimate power of recognition 
under clause 2 of rule XVII should circumstances 
so warrant. 

5. DECORUM IN DEBATE 
The SPEAKER. The Chair’s announced policies 
of January 7, 2003, January 4, 1995, and 
January 3, 1991, will apply in the 109th Congress. 
It is essential that the dignity of the 
proceedings of the House be preserved, not 
only to assure that the House conducts its 
business in an orderly fashion but also to 
permit Members to properly comprehend and 

participate in the business of the House. To 
this end, and in order to permit the Chair to 
understand and to correctly put the question 
on the numerous requests that are made by 
Members, the Chair requests that Members 
and others who have the privileges of the 
floor desist from audible conversation in the 
Chamber while the business of the House is 
being conducted. The Chair would encourage 
all Members to review rule XVII to gain a 
better understanding of the proper rules of 
decorum expected of them, and especially: to 
avoid ‘‘personalities’’ in debate with respect 
to references to other Members, the Senate, 
and the President; to address the Chair while 
standing and only when, and not beyond, the 
time recognized, and not to address the television 
or other imagined audience; to refrain 
from passing between the Chair and a Member 
speaking, or directly in front of a Member 
speaking from the well; to refrain from 
smoking in the Chamber; to disable wireless 
phones when entering the Chamber; to wear 
appropriate business attire in the Chamber; 
and to generally display the same degree of 
respect to the Chair and other Members that 
every Member is due. 

The Chair would like all Members to be on 
notice that the Chair intends to strictly enforce 
time limitations on debate. Furthermore, 
the Chair has the authority to immediately 
interrupt Members in debate who 
transgress rule XVII by failing to avoid ‘‘personalities’’ 
in debate with respect to references 
to the Senate, the President, and 
other Members, rather than wait for Members 
to complete their remarks. 

Finally, it is not in order to speak disrespectfully 
of the Speaker; and under the 
precedents the sanctions for such violations 
transcend the ordinary requirements for 
timeliness of challenges. This separate treatment 
is recorded in volume 2 of Hinds’ Precedents, 
at section 1248 and was reiterated on 
January 19, 1995. 

6. CONDUCT OF VOTES BY ELECTRONIC DEVICE 
The SPEAKER. The Speaker’s policy announced 
on January 4, 1995, with respect to 
the conduct of electronic votes will continue 
in the 109th Congress. 
As Members are aware, clause 2(a) of rule 
XX provides that Members shall have not 
less than 15 minutes in which to answer an 
ordinary [rollcall] record vote or quorum 
call. The rule obviously establishes 15 minutes 
as a minimum. Still, with the cooperation 
of the Members, a vote can easily be 
completed in that time. The events of October 
30, 1991, stand out as proof of this point. 
On that occasion, the House was considering 
a bill in the Committee of the Whole under 
a special rule that placed an overall time 
limit on the amendment process, including 
the time consumed by [rollcalls] record 
votes. The Chair announced, and then strictly 
enforced, a policy of closing electronic 
votes as soon as possible after the guaranteed 
period of 15 minutes. Members appreciated 
and cooperated with the Chair’s enforcement 
of the policy on that occasion. 
The Chair desires that the example of October 
30, 1991, be made the regular practice of 
the House. To that end, the Chair enlists the 
assistance of all Members in avoiding the unnecessary 
loss of time in conducting the 
business of the House. The Chair encourages 
all Members to depart for the Chamber 
promptly upon the appropriate bell and light 
signal. As in recent Congresses, the cloakrooms 
should not forward to the Chair requests 
to hold a vote by electronic device, 
but should simply apprise inquiring Members 
of the time remaining on the voting clock. 
Although no occupant of the Chair would 
prevent a Member who is in the well of the 
Chamber before the announcement of the result 
from casting his or her vote, each occupant 
of the Chair will have the full support 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H35 

of the Speaker in striving to close each electronic 
vote at the earliest opportunity. 
Members should not rely on signals relayed 
from outside the Chamber to assume that 
votes will be held open until they arrive in 
the Chamber. 

7. USE OF HANDOUTS ON HOUSE FLOOR 
The SPEAKER. The Speaker’s policy announced 
on September 27, 1995, which was 
prompted by a misuse of handouts on the 
House floor and made at the bipartisan request 
of the Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct, will continue in 109th Congress. 
All handouts distributed on or adjacent 
to the House floor by Members during 
House proceedings must bear the name of the 
Member authorizing their distribution. In 
addition, the content of those materials 
must comport with standards of propriety 
applicable to words spoken in debate or inserted 
in the Record. Failure to comply with 
this admonition may constitute a breach of 
decorum and may give rise to a question of 
privilege. 
The Chair would also remind Members 
that, pursuant to clause 5 of rule IV, staff is 
prohibited from engaging in efforts in the 
Hall of the House or rooms leading thereto 
to influence Members with regard to the legislation 
being amended. Staff cannot distribute 
handouts. 
In order to enhance the quality of debate 
in the House, the Chair would ask Members 
to minimize the use of handouts. 

8. USE OF EQUIPMENT ON HOUSE FLOOR 
The SPEAKER. The Speaker’s policy announced 
on January 27, 2000, as modified by 
the change in clause 5 of rule XVII in the 
108th Congress, will continue in the 109th 
Congress. All Members and staff are reminded 
of the absolute prohibition contained 
in clause 5 of rule XVII against the use of a 
wireless telephone or personal computer 
upon the floor of the House at any time. 
The Chair requests all Members and staff 
wishing to receive or send wireless telephone 
messages to do so outside of the Chamber, 
and to deactivate, which means to turn off, 
any audible ring of wireless phones before 
entering the Chamber. To this end, the Chair 
insists upon the cooperation of all Members 
and staff and instructs the Sergeant-at-
Arms, pursuant to clause 3(a) of rule II and 
clause 5 of rule XVII, to enforce this prohibition. 


9. JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES 
The SPEAKER. Based on discussions with 
the relevant committees, the further mutual 
understandings contained in the final two 
paragraphs of the ‘‘Memorandum of Understanding 
Between Energy and Commerce 
Committee and Financial Services Committee’’ 
dated January 30, 2001, shall no 
longer provide jurisdictional guidance. 
The policy announced in the 102d Congress 
with respect to jurisdictional concepts rebated 
to clause 5(a) of rule XXI—tax and tariff 
measures—will continue to govern but 
need not be reiterated, as it is adequately 
documented as precedent in the House Rules 
and Manual. 
The 109th Congress established the Committee 
on Homeland Security. The Chair 
would announce that the Speaker’s referrals 
of measures to the Select Committee on 
Homeland Security of the 108th Congress will 
not constitute precedent for referrals to the 
new committee.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 

The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before 
the House the following communication 
from the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives: 

OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 

Washington, DC, January 4, 2005. 

Hon. J. DENNIS HASTERT, 

The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, 
DC. 

DEAR MR. SPEAKER: Under Clause 2(g) of 
Rule II of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, 
I herewith designate Mr. 
Gerasimos C. Vans, Deputy Clerk, to sign 
any and all papers and do all other acts for 
me under the name of the Clerk of the House 
which he would be authorized to do by virtue 
of this designation, except such as are provided 
by statute, in case of my temporary 
absence or disability. 

If Mr. Vans should not be able to act in my 
behalf for any reason, then Ms. Marjorie C. 
Kelaher, Assistant to the Clerk or Mr. Daniel 

J. Strodel, Assistant to the Clerk should 
similarly perform such duties under the 
same conditions as are authorized by this 
designation. 
These designations shall remain in effect 
for the 109th Congress or until modified by 
me. 

With best wishes, I am, 
Sincerely, 
JEFF TRANDAHL.

PROVIDING AMOUNTS FOR INTERIM 
EXPENSES OF THE COMMITTEE 
ON HOMELAND SECURITY 
IN THE FIRST SESSION OF 
THE 109TH CONGRESS 

Mr. NEY. Mr. Speaker, I offer a resolution 
(H. Res. 10) and ask unanimous 

consent for its immediate consideration. 


The Clerk read the title of the resolution. 


The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Ohio? 

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, reserving the right to object, 
I yield to the distinguished gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. NEY) to explain the purpose 
of the resolution. 

Mr. NEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the gentleman from Connecticut 
(Mr. LARSON) for yielding to me. 

I rise today in support of the resolution 
to provide interim funding for the 
Committee on Homeland Security in 
the first session of the 109th Congress. 
The Committee on Homeland Security 
was not established as a permanent 
committee until this Congress. It was a 
select committee previously. Therefore, 
they did not fall under the House 
rules providing interim funding for 
other committees. We have a series of 
interim funding for our existing committees. 


This resolution will provide the necessary 
funds for the committee to continue 
its work from January 3 through 
March 31. The committee will then receive 
funding, we hope, for the duration 
of the 109th Congress; and that is 
when we will attempt by that time to 
bring out a permanent funding resolution 
for all committees so it would 
then receive its funding for the duration 
of the 109th Congress, all the public 
committees of the House. 

Once the committee funding resolution 
is adopted, then the system will go 
back to its regular order. I ask support 
for this legislation. 

(Mr. LARSON of Connecticut asked 
and was given permission to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, further reserving my right to 
object, I want to take a moment to 
both thank and applaud the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. NEY) for his diligence in 
determining the need for and pursuing 
the necessary funding for the authority 
for the new Committee of Homeland 
Security. 

I think he has described amply the 
need and the necessity under which the 
circumstances arose and why this resolution 
is so important. 

Third, I wanted to just take a brief 
moment to reflect on the extraordinary 
efforts of the gentleman from California 
(Mr. COX) and the former ranking 
minority member, Jim Turner, who 
is no longer with us, who took a skeletal 
concept of a committee and have 
turned it into a robust working reality. 

I would like to extend my own deep 
sense of appreciation to former representative 
Jim Turner for his extraordinary 
leadership and contributions on 
national security issues and, in particular, 
homeland security during the 
108th Congress. 

As the first ranking member of the 
Select Committee on Homeland Security, 
he vigorously pursued oversight 


H36 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

and legislation to enhance the security 
of the American people. His diligent 
and purposeful efforts have prompted 
the leadership of our country to move 
faster with a strong and smart sense of 
purpose to preserve and protect the security 
of our Nation. 

During the first 2 years of the Select 
Committee on Homeland Security’s existence, 
his work resulted in a number 
of significant initiatives and related efforts 
that we pause and honor today. In 
particular, in April of last year former 
Representative Turner released a 90-
page comprehensive plan to eliminate 
the threat of al Qaeda to the United 
States. The report, which includes over 
a hundred specific recommendations, 
sets forth a strategy to win the current 
war against al Qaeda and like-minded 
groups. Produced with the assistance of 
Democratic leadership and other committees, 
winning the war on terror reaffirms 
the commitment and need to 
prevail in the U.S. struggle against terrorism. 


b 1745 
The comprehensive plan played a 
large role in the introduction later in 
the 108th Congress of winning the War 
on Terror Act, H.R. 5291, designed to 
implement a series of initiatives and 
defeat terrorists and enemies. 
Mr. Turner’s accomplishments and 
what he was able to do in conjunction 
with the gentleman from California 
(Mr. COX) serve as a standard for the 
way that committees should proceed in 
this area. I cannot commend him 
enough and will present further accolades 
attesting to the attributes of Mr. 
Turner and the outstanding job he did 
on behalf of the State of Texas and this 
great country of ours. His service was 
exemplary, and I think this body owes 
him a great deal of gratitude for the 
performance that he undertook, along 
with the gentleman from California 
(Mr. COX) on this committee, and to see 
this committee today come to fruition 
as a full standing committee I think is 
a tribute to both of their hard work 
and zeal. 
The gentleman from California (Mr. 
COX) will continue on. Mr. Turner, of 
course, is no longer in this body but 
will long be remembered for his diligent 
effort, his straightforward manner, 
his gentleman-like way that he 
dealt with both sides of the issue and 
the manner in which he was able to 
bring these very important issues to 
the floor of this House to proceed in 
protecting this great Nation of ours 
from threat, from dangers abroad and 
here at home. 

Mr. Speaker, I want to say three things. 
First, I want to thank Chairman NEY for his diligence 
in determining the need for, and in pursuing 
the necessary funding authority for the 
new Committee on Homeland Security. 

Second, as the original co-sponsor of this 
resolution with Chairman NEY, I want to take 
a moment to ensure that Members understand 
its purpose. Although House rule X provides 
temporary interim funding for committees 
which existed in the 108th Congress, and 

which the House rules have recreated in the 
109th Congress, this temporary interim funding 
provision only applies to committees which 
succeed themselves in the new Congress. 
The former Select Committee on Homeland 
Security no longer exists, and the House rules 
have created a new, permanent standing 
Committee on Homeland Security to take its 
place. Because of this change, and in the absence 
of this resolution, the new Committee 
on Homeland Security would not have resources 
to operate until the House adopts the 
Omnibus Committee Funding Resolution 
sometime in March. 

By adopting the resolution, the House puts 
the new select committee on essentially the 
same temporary funding basis as other committees. 


Third, I want to take a moment to reflect on 
the extraordinary efforts of Chairman COX, and 
Ranking Minority Member Jim Turner, who 
took the skeletal concept of a committee, and 
turned it into a robust, working reality. 

Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my own 
deep sense of appreciation to Representative 
Jim Turner for his extraordinary leadership 
and contributions on national security issues 
and, in particular, homeland security during 
the 108th Congress. As the first ranking member 
of the Select Committee on Homeland Security, 
he vigorously pursued oversight and 
legislation to enhance the security of the 
American people. His diligent and purposeful 
efforts have prompted the leadership of our 
country to move faster, with a strong and 
smart sense of purpose, to preserve and protect 
the security of our nation. During the first 
2 years of the Homeland Security Committee’s 
existence, his work resulted in a number of 
significant initiatives and related efforts that I 
honor today. In particular: 

In April of last year, Representative Turner 
released a 90-page comprehensive plan to 
eliminate the threat of al-Qaeda to the United 
States. The report, which includes over 100 
specific recommendations, sets forth a strategy 
to win the current war against al-Qaeda 
and like-minded groups. Produced with the assistance 
of the Democratic leadership of other 
committees, Winning the War on Terror reaffirms 
the commitment needed to prevail in the 

U.S. struggle against terrorism. The comprehensive 
plan played a large role in the introduction 
later in the 108th Congress of the 
Winning the War on Terror Act, H.R. 5291, designed 
to implement a series of initiatives to 
defeat our terrorist enemies. 
In February, 2004, Representative Turner, in 
concert with his Democratic colleagues on the 
Select Committee on Homeland Security, released 
a comprehensive report, entitled America 
at Risk: Closing the Security Gap, identifying 
the significant security gaps that continued 
to remain across the United States more 
than 2 years after the attacks of September 

11. The comprehensive 135-page report identifies 
shortcomings in our homeland security 
efforts and recommends specific actions to ensure 
America is as safe as it needs to be from 
terrorist attack. An additional six oversight reports 
were subsequently issued on specific 
homeland security topics. 
In September 2004, Representative Turner 
released a comprehensive 130-page report, 
entitled Transforming the Southern Border: 
Providing Security and Prosperity in the Post-
9/11 World, calling for the transformation of 
the U.S. Southern Border to enhance security 

and promote economic prosperity. The result 
of a 6-month oversight effort, which included 
visits to multiple U.S. border communities, the 
report highlights the many security gaps that 
exist on the southern border and offers policy 
recommendations to close them. The comprehensive 
report was followed later in the 
108th Congress with the introduction of the 
Secure Borders Act, H.R. 5130, to strengthen 

U.S. border security. 
In addition to these efforts, Representative 
Turner, either alone or in concert with his 
Democratic colleagues, sponsored 12 homeland 
security legislative initiatives during the 
108th Congress. Among other subjects, Representative 
Turner’s efforts resulted in the introduction 
of the Prepare Act (H.R. 3158), 
containing unprecedented proposals to reform 
the U.S. first responder grant system by determining—
for the first time—the essential capabilities 
needed to protect American communities; 
and the Rapid Cures Act (H.R. 4258), 
designed to develop a national plan to develop 
countermeasures to protect Americans against 
the threat of bioterrorism. 

Mr. Speaker, these are only a few examples 
of the extraordinary contributions made by 
Representative Turner to our national homeland 
security effort. His leadership within the 
Democratic Caucus, and as a Member of the 
House on national security matters, has set a 
heightened standard for all of us to emulate. 
On the day that we create the first-ever permanent 
Committee on Homeland Security, it is 
fitting that we remember and honor the service 
and dedication of Representative Jim Turner. 

Mr. Speaker, needless to say, as an original 
co-sponsor of this temporary funding resolution 
for the new Committee on Homeland Security, 
I urge each of my colleagues to support 
our country’s continuing efforts to fight terrorism 
by voting in favor of this resolution. 

Mr. NEY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman 
yield? 

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. I yield 
to the gentleman from Ohio. 

Mr. NEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the gentleman from Connecticut, 
our ranking member, for supporting 
the resolution and also agree 
with his good and kind words about Mr. 
Turner. 

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of 
objection.

PEARCE). Is there objection to the request 
of the gentleman from Ohio?

EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES AND 
SUPPORT FOR ASSISTANCE TO 
VICTIMS OF EARTHQUAKE AND 
TSUNAMIS THAT OCCURRED ON 
DECEMBER 26, 2004, IN SOUTH 
AND SOUTHEAST ASIA 

Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, I offer a resolution 
(H. Res. 12) expressing condolences 
and support for assistance to the 
victims of the earthquake and 
tsunamis that occurred on December 
26, 2004, in South and Southeast Asia, 
and ask unanimous consent for its immediate 
consideration. 

The Clerk read the title of the resolution. 


The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Illinois? 

There was no objection. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 
H. RES. 12 

Whereas on December 26, 2004, a powerful 
earthquake measuring 9.0 on the Richter 
Scale occurred off the west coast of Northern 
Sumatra, Indonesia; 

Whereas the undersea earthquake created 
massive tsunamis that struck several countries 
throughout South and Southeast Asia, 
as well as on the coast of East Africa; 

Whereas the giant waves caused death and 
destruction on a nearly unprecedented scale, 
killing more than 140,000 people and leaving 
millions homeless; 

Whereas many thousands of people were 
killed in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and 
Thailand, and numerous others were killed 
in Somalia, Malaysia, Maldives, Bangladesh, 
Kenya, Burma, and elsewhere; 

Whereas an estimated one-third of the 
earthquake and tsunami victims were children, 
and many thousands more have been 
left orphaned or separated from their families; 


Whereas thousands of visitors and tourists 
from nearly 40 countries were killed in this 
natural disaster; 

Whereas between 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 people 
throughout the affected region are lacking 
basic survival requirements as a result of 
the tsunamis and there remains the risk of 
numerous additional deaths due to shortages 
of clean water, adequate shelter, food, sanitation, 
and basic healthcare; 

Whereas the United States and other donors 
have, to date, pledged an estimated 
$2,000,000,000 in emergency and long-term reconstruction 
assistance; and 

Whereas the human cost of this disaster 
transcends mere statistics and has resulted 
in deeply personal tragedies for countless 
families in the region and throughout the 
world: Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 


(1) mourns the horrific loss of life caused 
by the earthquake and tsunamis that occurred 
on December 26, 2004, in South and 
Southeast Asia; 
(2) expresses its deep condolences to the 
families of the many earthquake and tsunami 
victims; 
(3) applauds the prompt humanitarian response 
to the tsunami tragedy by governments, 
the United Nations and other international 
organizations, and nongovernmental 
organizations; 
(4) recognizes the generous outpouring of 
support for relief efforts from private citizens 
around the world, including in the 
United States; 
(5) affirms its commitment to additional 
generous United States support for relief and 
long-term reconstruction efforts in areas affected 
by the earthquake and tsunamis; and 
(6) urges continued attention by donors 
and relief agencies to the needs of vulnerable 
populations in the stricken countries, particularly 
the thousands of children who have 
been left parentless and homeless by this disaster. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. HYDE) is recognized 
for 1 hour. 

GENERAL LEAVE 

Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks on H. 
Res. 12, the resolution under consideration. 


The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Illinois? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, I yield half 
my time to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LANTOS) and ask unanimous 
consent that he may control that time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from Illinois? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 

Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of 
House Resolution 12 which the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LANTOS), 
the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. LEACH) 
and I introduced earlier today with numerous 
of our colleagues. It expresses 
the deep condolences of the House of 
Representatives for the victims of the 
massive earthquake and tsunamis that 
struck South and Southeast Asia on 
December 26, 2004, and affirms our commitment 
to additional generous support 
for relief and reconstruction efforts. 


The destruction wrought by this disaster 
is nearly incomprehensible. The 
confirmed death toll is nearly 150,000, 
approximately one-third of whom were 
children. Those countries that were 
hardest hit, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, 
India and Thailand, each lost many 
thousands, and the deadly effects were 
felt as far away as the eastern coasts of 
Africa. Millions of people are affected 
and lack the basic food, water, shelter 
and medical care necessary for survival. 
But, as the resolution notes, the 
human cost of this disaster transcends 
mere statistics and has resulted in 
deeply personal tragedies for countless 


H38 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

families in the region and throughout 
the world. Our prayers are with the 
victims, their families and the many 
men and women working tirelessly to 
provide critical assistance to those 
still at risk. 

I am proud of the swiftness and the 
magnitude of the relief effort that has 
been organized during the past week 
and a half. The United States has 
stepped forward with an initial commitment 
of $350 million, and we are 
providing crucial transportation and 
logistic support for the larger relief effort. 
The current total of international 
commitment stands at approximately 
$2 billion. I fully expect additional resources 
will be required, and we must 
all recognize that reconstruction from 
this epic catastrophe will not be a 
short-term project. 

It is fitting we consider this resolution 
on the first day of this new Congress. 
This effort is the latest instance 
in a long American tradition of humanitarian 
generosity, and our actions 
demonstrate our belief that the earthquake 
and the tsunamis of December 26 
were not primarily an Asian tragedy 
but a human tragedy. The people of the 
United States and all people of goodwill 
stand in solidarity with the many 
victims. 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I might consume, 
and I rise in strong support of this resolution. 


I want to thank the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. HYDE), my good friend and 
distinguished colleague, the chairman 
of the Committee on International Relations, 
for sponsoring this critical resolution, 
and I want to express my 
thanks to the chairman and ranking 
member of our Subcommittee on Asia 
and the Pacific for their outstanding 
work on this resolution. 

Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my 
deepest and heartfelt sympathy to the 
people of the countries so deeply 
stricken by the earthquake, the 
tsunamis and their after-effects. 

This disaster has taken some 150,000 
lives and left millions homeless, separated 
from their families, with no access 
to clean water, shelter, food, sanitation 
or health care. 

Mr. Speaker, late in December we all 
watched in shock as the news emerged 
detailing the horrors from the earthquake 
and tsunami-affected region. 
The initial reports of some 14,000 killed 
were simply stunning at the time, but 
a week later the numbers are 10 times 
higher, and with the horrendous death 
toll, we find there are countless more 
who are missing, including many 
American citizens. 

The numbers of people killed, missing, 
wounded or left homeless are nothing 
short of overwhelming, and the 
mind struggles to grasp that a tragedy 
of such dimensions is possible. But the 
destruction and the numbers are all 
too real, and the needs of the survivors 
are real as well. 

Our resolution affirms the rock-solid 
commitment of the American people 
and the government of the United 
States for relief and long-term reconstruction 
assistance in the areas affected 
by both the earthquake and the 
tsunamis, and it urges continued attention 
by all donors to the needs of the 
survivors, particularly the most vulnerable 
population, the children. 

Mr. Speaker, every country has the 
moral obligation to help the millions 
of people affected by the earthquake 
and the tsunamis. There is a human 
imperative to ensure that the survivors 
of this tragedy obtain much-needed humanitarian 
relief, but we must also 
work with the international community 
to help in the long-term reconstruction 
of the disaster-stricken countries, 
reconstruction efforts which will 
be needed for many years to come. 

I want to pay particular tribute to 
our military for their heroic assistance 
in this gigantic humanitarian crisis. 
No organization on the face of this 
planet could perform the miracles that 
our men and women in our military are 
doing every minute of every day as this 
crisis unfolds. 

Mr. Speaker, I find it an outrage that 
some of the wealthiest oil-rich States 
have pledged only a pittance, even 
though since oil prices are at sky-high 
levels they have received an enormous 
windfall; in the case of Saudi Arabia, 
some $50 billion last year, that is 
$50,000 million. 

Our resolution applauds the prompt 
humanitarian response of the United 
States, the American people, many of 
our friends and allies, international organizations 
and relief bodies. We must 
continue to support these efforts as 
long as they are necessary. 

The gentleman from Illinois (Chairman 
HYDE) and I will continue to work 
to determine the best way the Congress 
and the American people can continue 
to help the affected countries over the 
long run. It is only fitting, Mr. Speaker, 
that the first legislative act of this 
Congress is a truly bipartisan effort to 
demonstrate the generosity and the 
caring of the American people. 

b 1800 
I firmly hope that this spirit of bipartisanship 
may spread to some of our 
other efforts in the 109th Congress. I 
urge all of my colleagues to support H. 
Res. 12. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Iowa 
(Mr. LEACH). 
Mr. LEACH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
distinguished chairman and distinguished 
ranking member for bringing 
this very thoughtful resolution to the 
floor. 
What the world is witnessing with 
this tsunami in the Indian Ocean is a 
tragedy of awesome dimensions which 
the executive branch of the United 
States, the Congress, and the American 
people are determined to address in the 
most compassionate way possible. 

I stress the word ‘‘compassion’’ because 
in international affairs today, 
the issue of motives is on everybody’s 
mind. I would like to make it very 
clear that the only motive of the 
American people is compassion. There 
may be geopolitical spinoffs to any actions 
any government at any time 
makes or does not make, but this is an 
issue of people; and it is the obligation 
of the people’s House of the United 
States to reflect the heart and soul of 
our constituents, and this we are doing 
in this resolution. 

It is true that this issue is a long way 
from home. It is also true that it is expensive. 
Beyond that, it is impressive 
to me how unprecedented the initial reaction 
has been. In less than 2 weeks, 
hundreds of millions of dollars of assistance 
have already been brought to 
bear. Indeed, a kind of competitive 
compassion has been precipitated involving 
nation states, international organizations, 
nongovernmental organizations, 
and faith-based institutions. 

As the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LANTOS) mentioned, it is particularly 
impressive what the United 
States military has been able to do in 
very short order. It is the institution of 
our society that can act the quickest 
in the face of every kind of emergencies. 
Our military has become, in 
essence, an instrument of peace in a 
way that it was not necessarily designed 
to be, but which we as the 
American people want it to perform. 

Finally, let me stress that in addition 
to the issue at stake, this is an incredibly 
important time in human history 
to attempt to develop models of 
concern and action that bring people 
together rather than tear them apart. 
To the degree that a model of compassion 
which may or may not be competitive 
is contrasted with models of accelerating 
hate, we have hope that other 
kinds of disasters that may be man-
made instead of nature-made can be 
addressed in similar kinds of ways. 

This is a beginning, somewhat hortatory 
resolution of the United States 
Congress; but it is meaningful because 
it is a commitment. I would simply 
like to stress how impressed I am how 
every Member of Congress, every constituent 
that has talked to me, every 
member of the executive branch is 
committed to doing the utmost we conceivably 
can. 

This is an issue, as the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LANTOS) mentioned, 
of a human dimension, not any 
other kind. 

Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. MENENDEZ), 
a distinguished member of the 
Committee on International Relations 
and the chairman of the House Democratic 
Caucus. 

Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, 
thank the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LANTOS), the distinguished ranking 
member of the Committee on International 
Relations, for his early work 
on this, along with the chairman. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H39 

As a cosponsor, I rise in strong support 
of this resolution expressing our 
condolences and our support for additional 
assistance to the victims of the 
natural disasters in South and Southeast 
Asia. It is hard to find words to express 
our sympathy, our condolences, 
and for that fact our admiration for 
the strength and courage of the people 
in the many countries who survived 
the devastating earthquakes and 
tsunamis only 10 days ago. 

I am proud that the United States 
has pledged $350 million in aid, bringing 
the total aid pledged worldwide to 
approximately $2 billion; but we will be 
called upon to do more. 

It is almost impossible to comprehend 
that over 150,000 people died 
and that an additional 3 to 5 million 
are living without the basic necessities 
to survive. Unfortunately, these survivors 
now face a new threat from disease 
and starvation. Right now, ruined 
transportation, infrastructure, and 
communication systems are hampering 
some aid efforts. The international 
community needs to address these serious 
problems to ensure aid reaches all 
those who need it. We must house, feed, 
and protect the people who survived 
and help these same people rebuild 
their homes, their economies, and their 
lives. That is why the United States 
and other donor countries have pledged 
our involvement now and in the future. 
But it is also the individual contributions 
of Americans that make the difference 
and show our collective compassion 
and understanding. 

It is impossible to calculate the number 
of people who lost family members 
or whose homes, towns, and villages 
were destroyed; and I often think about 
how would we feel if this catastrophe 
happened in our homes, our towns, our 
States, or our country. We must also 
remember that each person lost was an 
individual whose life touched many 
others. In New Jersey in my own district, 
we have families from the impacted 
countries; and I extend my 
deepest sympathy to anyone who has 
lost a family member or a loved one. 

I also want to recognize the generosity 
of Americans and private citizens 
around the world. Just as the 
world supported the United States and 
the victims of the families of the victims 
of the 9/11 attacks, our citizens 
have shown their sympathy and commitment 
to the victims of the tsunami. 
In particular, I want to thank our 
troops who are on the front lines in the 
disaster areas, bringing food, water, 
medical assistance, and other relief to 
those who need it most. 

Finally, even in the midst of our 
mourning, I believe that from the ashes 
of this tragedy new opportunity will 
arise. In Sri Lanka, rebels and the government 
are working to provide relief 
together. In Indonesia, the United 
States and the international community 
are all working to provide assistance 
to those affected by the disaster. 
In the United States, we have a great 
opportunity to show our empathy and 

our generosity to the world. I believe 
we can lead not only in war but in relief, 
and that we need to be as committed 
to fighting disease, famine, and 
tragedy as we are to fighting the war 
on terror. Then we will win the hearts 
and minds of many people in this country, 
as well as show America to be the 
beacon of light that it is. 

Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. BURTON), my learned colleague. 

Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding 
me this time and for his kind remarks. 

Mr. Speaker, this is a very solemn 
occasion on which we meet here tonight: 
150,000 people have perished in 
an unforeseen disaster that took place 
a little over a week ago. The world has 
joined hands to try to help these people 
who suffered in Indonesia and the entire 
region. 

The gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
WEXLER) and I are co-chairmen of the 
Indonesian Caucus, and we have been 
working with people in the Indonesian 
Government because they have moved 
so rapidly towards democracy and the 
things that we believe in in this country. 
It is tragic at this moment in history 
that they have suffered, along 
with Sri Lanka, India, and the rest of 
that region, so heavily because of this 
horrible tragedy that occurred just a 
short time ago. President Bush has responded. 
This country has responded to 
the tune of $350 million, as the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LANTOS) 
and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
HYDE) have just recently stated. That 
is great. Our military has responded 
very rapidly. That is important as well. 

But the American people, if I were 
able to talk to them tonight, could respond 
in an equal fashion. If I were allowed, 
Mr. Speaker, and I know I am 
not allowed to speak directly to the 
American people, but if I were, I would 
say, if they want to make contributions 
to help our government help the 
people of that region, they could contact 
and make contributions through 
www.usafreedomcorps.gov. I know I 
cannot say that because we are not 
able to make that kind of a plea from 
the well to the American people. But if 
I could, I would once again ask them to 
make contributions through 
www.usafreedomcorps.gov because that 
would help augment what the United 
States Government is trying to do to 
help the people of this region. 

As many as 5 million people, as many 
as the people in the whole State of Indiana, 
could adversely be affected if 
they do not get the resources necessary 
to help with the potential health problems 
and the infrastructure problems 
that occur over there. We want to 
make sure that the world tragedy that 
has occurred in that region does not 
get any worse, and the best way to do 
that is to make sure the resources they 
need get there as quickly as possible. 

We are doing our part as a government, 
but the American people and the 
rest of the people could help as well if 
they choose to do so. 

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, 
the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LANTOS) and the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. HYDE), for bringing this 
resolution forward tonight, along with 
the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. LEACH). 
We really appreciate what our government 
and the President is trying to do. 
The President has appointed former 
President Bush and President Clinton 
to head up an effort to raise additional 
resources. We appreciate that, and we 
urge the American people to help as 
well in any way that they can. 

Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON-LEE), an indefatigable 
fighter on behalf of suffering people 
across the globe. 

(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked 
and was given permission to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, let me add my great appreciation 
to the distinguished gentleman 
from California (Mr. LANTOS), the gentleman 
from Illinois (Chairman HYDE), 
and the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. 
LEACH) for recognizing the need for 
this Congress on the very day of our 
swearing-in ceremonies to offer to the 
people of the world our deepest sympathy, 
and also our ability to be able 
to understand a horrific tragedy that is 
unspeakable. 

We note 140,000 who may have died by 
the tsunami, but it may be growing, 
150,000, 160,000. As I listened to the remarks 
being made by the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. HYDE), I noted as we 
have worked together on these issues 
that more than one-third are children, 
and how we can all recall the day of 9/ 
11 when it came to our attention in 
New York that so many children had 
been left behind because of the tragedy 
and death of their parents. 

Now not only do we have children 
that have died, but we have children 
that are left behind. So I say to those 
in Indonesia and Sri Lanka, Thailand 
and India, Somalia, Malaysia, 
Maldives, Bangladesh, Kenya, Burma, 
and many other places, that we recognize 
that no words can comfort you for 
this tragedy. 

But out of this enormous tragedy I 
believe that the world can now take its 
rightful place as a healer, as a place 
where there is caring, there is nurturing. 
And so for the $350 million, although 
many of us recognize that the 
initial response was not what we wanted 
it to be, today we come in celebration 
and acknowledgment of the leadership 
that has been given by this Nation. 
We are grateful for the $350 million; 
but more importantly, I am grateful 
for the words of the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. HASTERT) that we will do 
more. 

I think it is also important to state 
for the record $2 billion around the 
world has been promised. That shows 
that the world can work together for 
peace for humanitarian causes. Might I 
also say in a special note and special 
prerogative that I would like to congratulate 
those in the city of Houston 


H40 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

and acknowledge the work that was 
done by that city. 

On December 27, 2004, over 75 persons 
joined in a very small room in my Federal 
building and organized a Houston’s 
Solution For Tsunami Victims. The 
representatives were from the council 
offices of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the 
Council Office of Thailand, Pakistan, 
India and the Vietnam community and 
others. 

b 1815 
What we wanted to do is not to be 
selfish and to separate ourselves but we 
wanted to have the Houston mark on 
this terrible tragedy. And so to my colleagues, 
the City of Houston is organizing 
as a city. Some of our ideas will 
be, of course, to adopt cities in those 
regions to be part of the long-term rebuild 
of schools and hospitals and as 
well to provide medical supplies and 
other dollars to be part of the larger effort. 
My hat is off to that effort. In 
fact, our first event will be this Sunday, 
January 9, in Houston, Texas. 
Might I close by saying this is what 
can be done all over the Nation and I 
know it is being done. I will also ask 
my colleagues to join me in supporting 
legislation that I am filing, a resolution 
on temporary protective status of 
those individuals in this country whose 
documentation may be expiring and 
therefore are not able to go back to 
these devastated countries will be allowed 
to stay here until their nations 
are rebuilt. I look forward to working 
with my colleagues on this important 
effort. 
I thank the leaders who have put forward 
this resolution. They are visionaries 
but most importantly they are 
humanitarians. I am glad today this 
Congress is standing up to be called not 
just a Congress but people who care, 
who believe in the world family. 
Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to yield 4 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from California 
(Mr. ROHRABACHER). 
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of this resolution. I 
would like to express my appreciation 
to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
HYDE) and the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LANTOS) again leading, 
being the moral leaders of this body 
concerning issues of human rights and 
humanitarian concerns. I appreciate 
their leadership. I am a very grateful 
follower. I would like to thank the gentleman 
from Iowa (Mr. LEACH) for his 
leadership on this issue as well. 
This resolution does express our condolences 
to the people of Asia and East 
Africa devastated by this incredible 
tsunami which on December 26 hit this 
region and has cost at least 140,000 
lives. It is a staggering number of lives. 
It is hard to comprehend how many 
people have lost loved ones and are suffering. 
In this time of need, the world 
has responded in a manner unprecedented 
in its size and scope to a catastrophe 
that is unprecedented. Between 
private and public donations, the relief 

effort so far has totaled over $3 billion. 
The distorted characterization of a 
confused United Nations official notwithstanding, 
America can be especially 
proud that in this time of need 
our people and our government have 
stepped forward. In addition to government 
aid, which sometimes people 
overseas only recognize the government 
aid, a significant amount of donations 
have come from charitable organizations 
and private donations in 
which our people voluntarily give out 
of a loveness in their heart and a concern 
for humanity. As we speak, financial 
and material donations, private 
sector as well as public, continue to be 
pledged. 

However, all the relief does not diminish 
the anguish and personal pain 
of so many tens of thousands, hundreds 
of thousands of people who have lost 
loved ones. And to those people, you 
have the prayers of the American people 
and our hearts are with you. Every 
day there are new stories of a family 
having lost both mother and father or 
parents who have lost their children. 
Communities have been demolished 
and the hard work in piecing these people’s 
lives together will take many, 
many years. 

The people of the United States stand 
with these people who are in need and 
who have been affected by this horrible 
tragedy. Incidentally, many of those 
who have been suffering from this natural 
disaster are Muslims. I would hope 
that these people in the Islamic world 
understand that America is stepping 
forward with generosity to help these 
people not because they are Muslims or 
whatever their faith is but because we 
care about them as human beings. We 
hope that they put that in perspective 
when they are trying to analyze what 
the United States is all about. 

Compounding this tragedy, of course, 
is an economic issue that we need to 
discuss as well and that is the lapse of 
a 30-year-old WTO agreement for manufactured 
apparel. This would not even 
come up and people would not understand 
it had it not been for the tsunami. 
A critical part of Sri Lanka’s 
and Thailand’s as well as Indonesia’s 
economy deals with producing this apparel. 
With the ending of this agreement, 
of the quota system for apparel, 
we can expect that China will benefit 
dramatically even though China has 
not suffered from this natural disaster. 
It will benefit and $2.5 billion of trade 
will be taken from Sri Lanka alone, for 
example. 

I think in light of this tsunami tragedy 
and the current labor practices in 
China that an extension of this agreement 
is not only in the best interests 
of our friends in Thailand and Sri 
Lanka but for all countries who believe 
in standards of labor and human rights 
practices. I would suggest that we go 
back to those quotas as of January 1 
and postpone the elimination of the 
quotas for 2 years in order to help 
those countries that are now suffering. 

I would also like to recognize the 
people of Thailand and the royal fam


ily of Thailand who have cared for 
thousands of refugees and people over 
the years from Burma, Laos, Cambodia 
and Vietnam. For over 30 years they 
have taken in refugees and so generously 
cared for them. Now they are in 
need of help and it is up to us to help 
the people of Thailand. Our relief efforts 
and our donations go with a great 
deal of understanding that the Thais 
have themselves been generous and it 
is our time to be generous to them. Relief 
workers are now struggling to reunite 
families and find loved ones that 
are dead and their remains brought 
back to the family. As they do, the 
people of Thailand are going to be suffering. 
We know that. I know those 
people. Let us keep them in mind and 
their suffering in mind. As we move 
forward, let us do ourselves proud by 
doing what is right and that is what is 
happening throughout America and the 
free world today. 

Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from New Jersey 
(Mr. PALLONE). 

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, let me 
also thank the chairman and the ranking 
member for putting forth House 
Resolution 12, of which I am a cosponsor, 
which I do think is very significant 
in light of what we have witnessed in 
the aftermath of the tsunami over the 
last 10 days. 

I want to say, first of all, that this 
resolution as we know talks about a 
number of things that we need to do 
and that to some extent we have already 
done. One is to provide humanitarian 
assistance. I know the President 
has pledged $350 million, which may 
seem like a lot, but I frankly think 
that we probably will end up needing 
significantly more in terms of humanitarian 
assistance. In addition to that, 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LANTOS) mentioned long-term reconstruction, 
development assistance because 
we must remember that many of 
the people no longer have a means of 
livelihood, fishermen who no longer 
have their fishing boats, farmers whose 
land may be salted and have no longer 
the ability to farm. We have to think 
in terms of long-term reconstruction 
and development aid. 

And finally what I call the early 
warning system. There has been a lot 
of discussion and I think there is a 
need to expand the tsunami early 
warning system that exists in the Pacific 
not only to the Indian Ocean but 
also possibly to the Atlantic Ocean and 
throughout the world. We know that 
this can be done fairly inexpensively. 
We are talking about maybe 5 to $10 
million for the Atlantic, maybe $20 
million at the most for the Indian 
Ocean. I think this has to be part of 
our effort to make sure that this event 
never occurs again. 

I just also wanted to say I was, of 
course, disappointed with the early 
stages of the President’s response, but 
when he said that he wanted now to 
provide all appropriate assistance, I 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H41 

certainly take him at his word and I 
appreciate the fact that now we are 
moving forward. He has not only provided 
a public element with the $350 
million but sent his brother and Secretary 
of State Powell overseas and 
now we have the private element with 
the two former Presidents that are involved. 
We should be very happy with 
the fact that more private American 
assistance has been pledged than even 
the $350 million in government assistance 
that the President has promised. I 
know that at some point we may have 
to do an appropriations bill, perhaps an 
emergency appropriations bill to replenish 
the assistance that has already 
been out there, and I certainly know 
that over the next few weeks that the 
chairman and the ranking member and 
the members of the Appropriations 
Committee will be looking at that. I 
think it is very important. 

The last thing that I did want to 
mention is the fact that in my district, 
as many of my colleagues have mentioned, 
we have a large number of Indian 
Americans, Sri Lankan Americans, 
South Asians from many of the 
countries that have been impacted. It 
is amazing to see the outpouring from 
these communities and from the public 
in general in terms of providing money, 
providing clothing, providing medical 
supplies. The outpouring that we have 
seen I think is really a symbol and a 
reality of what Americans are all about 
from all walks of life. 

Again I want to thank my colleagues 
for putting this resolution together 
and the other commitments that I expect 
will be forthcoming over the next 
few weeks. 

Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. FERGUSON). 

Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the chairman and thank the 
gentleman from California as well for 
bringing this resolution to the floor. As 
a mark of respect for the victims of the 
Indian Ocean earthquake and the resulting 
tsunamis, I rise today in strong 
support of this resolution, as a cosponsor 
of this resolution, to honor the victims 
and to show my support for the 
humanitarian aid that our country is 
helping to provide with our partners 
from around the world. My prayers go 
out to the victims and their families 
who have been struck by this horrific 
tragedy, in particular, the large Asian 
and Indian community that resides in 
my district and, in fact, in all of our 
State of New Jersey. 

Currently the estimated death toll is 
more than 140,000, in some cases over 
150,000 people in South and Southeast 
Asia and East Africa. Between 3 and 5 
million people throughout the affected 
region are lacking basic survival requirements, 
access to clean water, adequate 
shelter, food, sanitation and 
health care. Contaminated water 
sources in the affected countries have 
increased the risk of cholera, dysentery 
and malaria. Approximately 500,000 
people have been displaced in Indo


nesia; more than 889,000 are displaced 
in Sri Lanka; 3.5 million people are affected 
in India; and more than 10,000 
are injured in Thailand. In addition, 
between 15,000 and 30,000 may be affected 
in Somalia; 12,000 are displaced 
in Malaysia; and approximately 12,000 
are displaced and 300,000 affected in the 
Maldives. These numbers are astounding. 
We must continue to do all that we 
can to help the millions who have been 
affected by this disaster. I strongly 
support all efforts by our country and 
the many others that are helping to 
meet the call for financial and voluntary 
relief. In fact, it is my hope to 
travel to the affected areas very soon 
to help do my part in seeing that the 
relief effort under way is a success. 

Further, I would like to recognize the 
strong support of the American people. 
They have heeded the call to help their 
neighbors across the globe with a dedication 
and a determination that is an 
embodiment of our American spirit. We 
have banded together as a Nation and 
have continued our longstanding tradition 
of donating our considerable resources 
to our fellow men and women 
around the world. Again, let me thank 
Chairman HYDE and Ranking Member 
LANTOS for bringing this important 
resolution to the floor. I am proud to 
be a cosponsor. 

Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted 
to yield 2 minutes to my good 
friend, the distinguished gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. DAVIS). 

Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from California 
for yielding me this time. I also want 
to commend him and the chairman of 
the committee, my colleague from Illinois, 
and all of those who have spoken. 
I rise in strong support of this resolution. 
I also want to commend the people 
of my district and people throughout 
America who have risen to the occasion. 


I noted with pride on New Year’s Eve 
African-American churches in my district 
who had turned their traditional 
watch meeting night into an appeal for 
the people who have been affected. I 
took great pride in Chinatown in my 
district a few days ago when my Chinese 
constituents, Chinese Americans, 
were organizing relief efforts to send 
money and medical aid. I also took 
great pride when my Tamilian friends 
from Sri Lanka came to express the 
support that they not only were seeking 
but were also giving. This is a tremendous 
effort on the part of not only 
organized governments but organized 
citizens throughout America. I am 
pleased to be a part of it. Again I commend 
Chairman HYDE, Ranking Member 
LANTOS and all of those who have 
spearheaded this resolution. 

b 1830 
Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gentleman 
from California (Mr. ROYCE). 
Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman for yielding me this time. 
I rise in support of this resolution. I 
think we all watched in shock at the 

devastation caused by the December 26 
earthquake and the subsequent tsunami. 
I led a delegation to Gujarat in 
2001 to assess the damage after the 
earthquake that shook India, and that 
devastation, that tragedy, was indescribable. 
And after that quake, the 
world community pulled together, as 
did the people of India, including Indian 
Americans, to address the humanitarian 
disaster. But the quake there in 
magnitude was less than this quake. 
This quake was 9.0. And the effect has 
been such that the death toll today is 
over 150,000. 

As we have heard on the floor, millions 
have been left homeless. Indeed 
the images of death and destruction 
that we have seen on television are sobering. 
It is difficult to comprehend 
the extent of the damage because the 
devastation stretches across 5,000 miles 
and 12 countries. It stretches across 
geographical and cultural and religious 
lines. 

As is often the case in extreme disaster, 
we also see the best in the 
human spirit. There has been an outpouring 
of support across our country 
from both individuals and from businesses. 
Members from the Los Angeles 
County Fire Department’s disaster response 
team have been dispatched to 
Sri Lanka. Niagara Water Company of 
Irvine, California, has donated 55,000 
gallons of water. 

The actions taken by the United 
States Government speak louder than 
any statement can. Not surprisingly, 
first on the scene was the United 
States military. An aircraft carrier 
task force was immediately diverted 
from Hong Kong to the Gulf of Thailand, 
and a Marine Expeditionary 
Force from Guam was dispatched to 
the Bay of Bengal. No other organization 
in the world can tackle the 
logistical challenge of getting these 
types of assets on location to assist the 
people in need. As a matter of fact, the 
local governor in Aceh said that the 

U.S. Navy helicopters appeared to him 
like ‘‘angels,’’ in his words, as they arrived 
to deliver supplies to those people 
in need. 
Through this challenge we see opportunities 
for the United States to make 
a lasting impression in South and in 
Southeast Asia. Cooperation between 
the U.S. and India is expanding like 
never before. The U.S. regional command 
center for this unprecedented relief 
operation has been established in 
Thailand. And the U.S. and Indonesian 
military forces are working together 
for the first time in many years. 

The United States stands by the people 
of South and Southeast Asia during 
this catastrophe. 

Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. ZOE LOFGREN), the dean of 
the California delegation. 

Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I give thanks to the chairman 
and ranking member for having this 
resolution before us this evening. When 
we turn on the TV, when we read the 


H42 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

news and we learn of just the scope of 
the magnitude of this disaster, it is 
simply staggering. In India and Sri 
Lanka and Thailand and Indonesia, 
Malaysia, the Maldives, Bangladesh, 
Burma, even Kenya and Somalia on the 
African coast, the devastation is simply 
stunning. And it is important that 
the United States show leadership to 
the world and to the victims in coming 
to grips with this. I really cannot 
think of an event in my lifetime that 
has been this enormous in terms of loss 
of life and long-term implications for 
this part of the world. So I am glad 
that we are here on this first day of the 
109th Congress to show the world that 
we stand ready and in solidarity with 
those who have lost their lives, those 
who have lost members of their family, 
and certainly there are those from 
other parts of the world visiting South 
Asia. 

I want, as others have mentioned, to 
give great thanks to my constituents 
in Silicon Valley first started by Americans 
who were from South Asia or 
whose families were originally from 
South Asia, organizing volunteer efforts; 
and the response has been dramatic 
and huge from every corner of 
Silicon Valley to step forward and to 
help with the relief effort. However, as 
others have mentioned, our assistance 
is going to be needed for some time to 
come. 

I heard on the radio news this morning 
that in some of the towns, 80 percent 
of the teachers have been lost, 85 
percent of all the police officers have 
died. The infrastructure of civilization 
for many of the towns and localities is 
simply gone. So we will look to so 
many of our fellow citizens to do volunteer 
efforts and to donate generously. 
They are not disappointing us. 
But it is the institution of the United 
States Government that is going to 
have to be in with a helping hand to 
help these parts of the world become 
civilized again, to come up from the 
muck that the tsunami brought to 
them and to take once again their 
place in the world. I am pledged to 
work with all of my colleagues in the 
House towards that end. I am proud 
that the Speaker and the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), our leader, 
each made this tragedy part of their 
opening remarks at the start of the 
109th Congress. I thank them for that. 

Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

Long before she joined the Congress, 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PELOSI) was a fighter for all humane 
and humanitarian endeavors across the 
globe. She expresses the views of all 
Democrats on this important humanitarian 
crisis. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she 
may consume to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PELOSI). 

Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished ranking member of 
the committee for his kind words and 
for his great leadership. And I thank 
the gentleman from Illinois, the two of 

them, for bringing this very important 
resolution both to the floor. They both 
have been champions for humanitarian 
causes and human rights throughout 
the world. I thank the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LANTOS), especially for 
his work on the Human Rights Caucus. 
And, in fact, the definition of human 
rights and our attention to the condition 
of mankind extends to the issue 
that is before us today. 

As the world knows, 9 days ago we 
witnessed on television the most destructive 
power of nature, a powerful 
earthquake and subsequent tsunami 
that took more than 150,000 lives and 
seriously injured hundreds of thousands 
more across Asia. The unspeakable 
devastation the world has witnessed 
in these areas presents a challenge 
not only for the millions of people 
who are struggling to recover and 
rebuild but also for all of us who are 
called by our faith and our common humanity 
to help those in need. 

Nothing can give back all that has 
been lost, but the actions we take 
today and in the days ahead help to 
keep the epic disaster from becoming 
even more far reaching. In a tragedy 
such as this one, there is only the 
smallest measure of inspiration that 
can be taken from the devastation. 

But if there is anything hopeful to be 
found in the aftermath of the tragedy, 
it is that the worst of Mother Nature 
has brought out the best in human nature. 
Americans have donated hundreds 
of millions of dollars in private donations. 
The coordinated efforts by 
USAID, the International Red Cross, 
UNICEF, OXFAM and Care and many 
others are providing quick and vital resources. 
Relief workers are struggling 
24 hours a day to distribute supplies 
and medical care to the injured and 
homeless. The United States Government 
has pledged $350 million in emergency 
assistance for the region. And 
when the victims of the disaster in 
Asia see our soldiers and ships and helicopters 
bringing food, supplies, and 
medical care, they see the compassion 
that is the best of America. 

The chairman and ranking member 
of the Committee on International Relations 
and I in my capacity as ranking 
member on the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing and Related Programs 
of the Committee on Appropriations, 
we have traveled the world to see our 
assistance at work, and we know that 
when the U.S. military becomes involved 
in humanitarian assistance, 
they are the best. They are well organized. 
They get the job done in record 
time. We are very proud of them and 
all that they do and certainly in the 
case of the tsunami. 

All of these things are critical, but 
much more needs to be done. It is estimated 
by the United Nations that 1.8 
million people will need food aid, 1.8 
million people. Roads and bridges will 
need to be rebuilt to get that aid to the 
people who need it. Millions of people 
are homeless and in need of shelter. 
The statistics are daunting, but we 

must not lose sight of the power of the 
United States to soften nature’s blow. 
The statistics are staggering, but we 
remember every single individual as a 
person who is affected by this. A compassionate 
and generous response from 
the United States is essential to save 
these individual lives and to stabilize 
the entire region. 

While there has been a strong initial 
response to the crisis, there must be 
initiative to assist in the longer-term 
reconstruction process. The United 
States must take the lead by providing 
a multi-year assistance package that 
does not come at the expense of other 
disaster relief efforts around the world. 
I hope that a package of aid and assistance 
for the victims of last week’s 
tsunamis will be the first significant 
bipartisan accomplishment of this 
109th Congress, and I know under the 
leadership of the gentleman from Illinois 
and the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LANTOS) and our distinguished 
Speaker in his beautiful words today 
about the disaster that we have a good 
chance that that will be possible. 

There is a passage in the Bible that 
speaks to the power of the spirit at 
times such as this: ‘‘The bricks have 
fallen down, but we will rebuild with 
dressed stone; the fig trees have been 
felled, but we will replace them with 
cedars.’’ As one who kind of likes victories, 
I understand the strength of cedars, 
but we will replace and rebuild. 

I kind of think another passage from 
the Bible is appropriate here. It is appropriate 
on many occasions, but I 
thought of it the minute I saw the tsunami, 
and that is in the Old Testament 
they tell us that to minister to the 
needs of God’s creation is an act of 
worship, to ignore those needs is to dishonor 
the God who made us and them. 
So we can have an act of worship by 
ministering to the needs of these people. 


I especially want to mention the 
country of Indonesia that has been devastated 
by the crisis. Indonesian health 
authorities reported Sunday that the 
tsunami may have killed 100,000 people 
in the Aceh province alone. This natural 
disaster comes after the Indonesian 
Government has performed massive 
military operations and frankly 
brutal acts of violence against the civilian 
population of Aceh in recent 
years. 

The international response presents 
an opportunity for the government of 
Indonesia to form a new partnership, a 
fresh start, with the people of Aceh. It 
is critical that the Indonesian Government 
continue to open the region to relief 
organizations, nongovernmental 
organizations, and the media. It will 
take a long time. It will require a great 
deal of help. The scars may never heal 
entirely, and the memories of loved 
ones lost will linger forever. But with 
the help of people of the world, the people 
of the affected countries will recover 
and rebuild. 

Already we see people who were 
strangers to each other before the disaster 
standing together, some of them 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H43 

right in this very room, and today with 
this resolution and with the actions 
that will be necessary in the coming 
days to give substance to our words, we 
say to them the people of the United 
States stand with them. We can say 
that with great assurance because of 
the leadership of the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. HYDE) and the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LANTOS) and those 
kind words, again, of the Speaker this 
morning. 

Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the leader for her powerful and eloquent 
statement. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. 
FALEOMAVAEGA), a distinguished member 
of the Committee on International 
Relations and ranking member of the 
Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee. 

Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from California 
for yielding me this time and also extend 
my appreciation to the chairman 
of our committee for the support and 
cosponsorship of this important resolution. 


Mr. Speaker, this certainly has been 
a tragic crisis in Southeast Asia, and I 
do not know if my colleagues know 
that I am probably one of the few Members 
who has ever personally experienced 
what it means to go through a 
tidal wave and so sad to hear from the 
media reports and learning in some 
parts of this region when the reefs and 
the beaches are sucked into the ocean 
and the water recedes some 300 yards 
from the reefs and the children and 
people not knowing the nature, that 
this is how a tidal wave comes about. 

b 1845 
And then, the children playing and 
the fish flopping all over the place 
thinking this is a blessing from God, 
and then knowing that they should be 
running in the opposite direction when 
the tidal wave hits. This is really a sad 
situation. 
Mr. Speaker, what I really wanted to 
address and share with my colleagues 
is a certain criticism that has been 
brought not only to the world community, 
but to our Nation, suggesting 
that our country has been stingy in 
giving assistance to those who are in 
need. Nothing could be further from 
the truth. 
Mr. Speaker, in the Wall Street Journal 
article on 31 January, and according 
to a USAID report, in the year 2000, 
our country donated over $56 billion in 
international assistance. Eighteen percent 
of that alone came from the government. 
$33.6 billion, or 60 percent, 
came from private donors, $3 billion 
from corporations, $3.4 billion from religious 
organizations, $18 billion from 
individual donations alone, not even 
counting foundations and from public 
organizations and universities. 
I suggest that the next time we get 
criticisms from others suggesting that 
our Nation has not been generous in 
giving assistance to those in need really 
needs to be corrected. And I am 

very, very glad not only from Secretary 
Powell, but from President 
Bush, that we need to make certain 
corrections. 

Mr. Speaker, I will insert for the 
RECORD the full text of this editorial 
commentary in the Wall Street Journal 
of 31 January. I urge my colleagues 
to support this resolution. 

[From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 3, 2005] 
FAR FROM STINGY 
Across the world, the reaction to Asia’s 
tsunami is bringing out the best in human 
nature. Fund-raising appeals, disaster-relief 
teams, military assets—all are being marshaled 
for the victims of this tragedy. 
Which makes it all the more outrageous 
that a top United Nations official chose this 
week to accuse the U.S. and other Western 
nations of being stingy with assistance to 
poorer nations. ‘‘We were more generous 
when we were less rich,’’ Undersecretary-
General for Humanitarian Affairs Jan 
Egeland lectured on Monday. ‘‘And it is beyond 
me why we are so stingy, really.’’ 
Now, complaints about U.S. miserliness 
are more routine than the earthquakes and 
floods that strike the globe. A favorite 
‘‘fact’’ of international critics is that while 
the U.S. government nearly always ranks 
first in absolute amounts of foreign aid, it 
tends to fall last among industrial countries 
in aid as a percentage of gross national product. 
The one-tenth of one percent that Washington 
devoted to foreign assistance, they 
say, is nothing compared with what the U.S. 
could afford. 
The problem is that, as with so many questions 
of accounting (say, Oil for Food), the 

U.N. and other international bodies rely on 
unreliable ledgers. Groups like the Development 
Assistance Committee (part of the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and 
Development) tend to look only at ‘‘official’’ 
government aid. What this misses is that 
Americans have never trusted government 
institutions to dole out assistance. Instead, 
we open our wallets for private groups that 
are better at targeting money where it’s 
needed, tracking projects, cutting waste— 
and getting results. 
When it comes to this sort of giving, nobody 
beats Americans. According to a 2003 
report from the U.S. Agency for International 
Development, U.S. international assistance 
to developing countries in 2000 was 
$56 billion. Yet just 18% of that was ‘‘official’’ 
government assistance. Some $33.6 billion—
or 60%—came from the private sector. 
Corporations shelled out nearly $3 billion. 
Religious groups weighed in with $3.4 billion. 
Individuals provided $18 billion. To say nothing 
of funds from foundations, private and 
voluntary organizations, or universities. 

Cynics mark this generosity down to a 

U.S. tax code that encourages giving. Yet 
most research shows that Americans view 
donations as a duty. Philanthropy magazine 
reports a study showing the average U.S. 
contribution outweighs the average German 
or French one seven- or eight-fold. This 
sense of responsibility is often motivated by 
faith; some 60% of American donations go to 
religious groups or causes. 
None of this sits well with the U.N., whose 
own budget relies on state dollars. A chastened 
Mr. Egeland was forced later this week 
to claim he’d been misinterpreted and to acknowledge 
U.S. generosity. But behind this 
apology is the U.N.’s longstanding belief that 
what’s really needed is for the U.S. and others 
to raise taxes to pay for more public foreign 
aid. 

That approach reigns in Western Europe 
and explains what’s wrong with so much of 
current foreign aid. Europeans have come to 

view private donations as a failure of the 
state and expect their governments to collect 
billions in taxes to shuffle along to slow-
moving and unaccountable international bureaucracies. 
The result is a lose-lose situation. 
Giving countries see their own economies 
depressed by higher taxes and receiving 
countries find the aid too often enabling 
strongmen or perpetuating poor policies. 

A far better approach, at least in the public 
sphere, are initiatives such as President 
Bush’s Millennium Challenge Account. By 
tying long-term assistance to improvements 
in specific economic and political goals— 
such as cracking down on corruption or establishing 
rules of law—foreign aid brings 
about real reform. This approach drives U.N. 
bureaucrats nuts, a sure sign it’s on the 
right track. 

Today’s priority in Asia is immediate humanitarian 
relief. The list of U.S.-based private 
and religious organizations already 
working in the area is stunning. And it’s 
good to see the U.S. decision effectively to 
go around U.N. bureaucracy by working directly 
with a coalition of Japan, Australia 
and India to coordinate relief. Meanwhile, we 
can expect the federal government to continue 
its tradition of generosity in the upcoming 
weeks—a tradition that resulted in 
$2.4 billion in humanitarian relief last year 
along, or 40% of the world total. 

But future money, both public and private, 
should be aimed at developing the sort of 
governments and economies that will be 
equipped to deal with disasters on their own. 

Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, we have 
no additional requests for time. In concluding, 
I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 

I again want to express my deep appreciation 
to my friend and distinguished 
colleague, the chairman of our 
committee, the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. HYDE). I want to say that all 
of us here are profoundly proud of the 
generosity of the American people, the 
generosity of our government, and the 
extraordinary skill and heroism of our 
military in facing up to this crisis. 
Those who cannot get over their mindless 
anti-Americanism should look at 
what the American people, the American 
government, and our military 
have done in the last few days concerning 
this crisis, and they will need 
to rethink their mindless hatred of this 
great Nation. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 

Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. WELLER). 

Mr. WELLER. Mr. Speaker, I stand 
in support of H.R. 12 expressing the 
condolences of this House and the support 
for the people of the countries 
that have been impacted by the tsunami 
in Asia. 

A friend of our country, Sri Lanka, 
was one of the countries most devastated. 
Sadly, Sri Lanka lost at least 
30,000 of its citizens, and that toll may 
rise well into the 40,000 range. I serve 
as co-chairman of the Sri Lanka Caucus 
in the House and I have traveled 
personally to Sri Lanka. I have seen 
firsthand many of the areas now devastated 
by the tsunami, and my heart 
and prayers and those of my colleagues 
go out to the people of Sri Lanka at 
this difficult time. 


H44 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

Today many Americans are still unaccounted 
for who were in Sri Lanka 
when this tragedy struck, but as we 
deal with that loss and also work to 
help the nearly 1 million living survivors 
who are now displaced in Sri 
Lanka, we continue to move forward 
and we want to express our support. 

Secretary of State Colin Powell plans 
to be in Sri Lanka this Friday to express 
our support and to see firsthand 
what more we can do, and I am proud 
of the support that the United States 
Government has been providing. In the 
early hours of the day after Christmas, 
top U.S. Government officials began 
the work of aiding Sri Lanka and the 
entire region, immediately moving 
money to the affected areas and sending 
out teams to survey the damage for 
accurate assessment of needs. To date 
our President, President Bush, has 
pledged $350 million in relief in recovery 
assistance, and already $13 million 
has been allocated to our friend Sri 
Lanka alone. 

The Department of Defense and 
USAID have established a regional coordination 
center in Sri Lanka to coordinate 
our relief efforts to the region 
as well as this friendly country. Hundreds 
of USAID and military personnel 
are on the ground in Sri Lanka helping 
to assist the relief efforts. I would also 
note that the men and women of the 
United States military are fully engaged 
helping Sri Lanka. In this region, 
the United States has committed 
a vast majority of military assets to 
the region: 20 ships, 14 strategic lift 
cargo planes, and 48 helicopters. The 
USS Bonhomme Richard Expeditionary 
Strike Group is in route to Sri Lanka, 
as well as a ship capable of producing 
90,000 gallons of fresh water every day. 
We have also instituted a cash for work 
program, helping the local economy 
and cleanup efforts at the same time. 

Mr. Speaker, there is so much that 
we can do, and I want to thank our 
friends in the private sector who have 
stepped forward. We in the United 
States are doing our part and we want 
to do more. We are working in partnership 
with the world in this effort to aid 
Sri Lanka, and the Indian government 
in particular has been very helpful in 
the Sri Lanka mission. 

The United States will continue to 
help Sri Lanka and the entire region as 
long as needs are there. We stand in 
support and we express our condolences, 
and our prayers go out to the 
people of Sri Lanka. 

Mr. REYES. Mr. Speaker, like people everywhere, 
I mourn the devastation and loss of life 
caused by the massive tsunami in South Asia. 
The enormity of the disaster is staggering and 
I extend my condolences to those around the 
world touched by this tragedy. My thoughts 
and prayers are with the victims and their families 
in this time of overwhelming need. 

I applaud the outpouring of support by the 
many nations, organizations and individuals 
across the world who have responded quickly 
to the disaster. By working together, we will 
help rebuild the lives of the residents of South 
Asia. 

I will travel to South Asia next week and, 
through the generosity of numerous hospitals 
in my district of El Paso, Texas, will deliver 
medical supplies to assist in some small way 
with the relief and rebuilding process. 

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support 
the resolution before us today, and ask all 
Americans to continue to keep the victims of 
this terrible tragedy in their prayers. 

Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of myself, 
my family and the constituents of the 17th 
District of California, I would like to express 
our heartfelt condolences to the victims and 
their families of the tsunami natural disaster. 
As the number of victims continues to increase, 
America is united in mourning the 
staggering loss of lives—many, many of whom 
are children. 

In the last week, the millions of people affected 
by the tsunami have faced terrifying obstacles. 
But the global community stands in 
solidarity with the 12 affected nations. While 
the United States and other governments have 
promised humanitarian aid, private citizens in 
the United States have also shown an amazing 
outpouring of generosity and compassion. 
In my own congressional district, which has 
experienced a number of natural disasters, a 
number of compassionate people are reaching 
out to the South Asia disaster victims. For example, 
the Salinas Rotary Club, along with 
other Rotary Clubs across the country, is organizing 
to supply ‘‘Shelter Boxes’’ that contain 
basic necessities like tents and sleeping 
bags. 

Humanitarian assistance is desperately 
needed on an unprecedented global scale. 
The international community has pledged $2 
billion, with a contribution of $350 million from 
the United States, but it is clear that more will 
be required of many. I intend to support an 
emergency funding bill for U.S. tsunami aid 
and I urge the President and the Republican 
leadership to be generous, as the world community 
was to the United States in the wake 
of 9/11. 

In addition to our efforts to help the survivors 
of this tragedy, we must also work to 
ensure that we can better alert people to similar 
events in the future. The United States 
should lead the world in implementing a global 
ocean observing system. The recently-released 
U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy final 
report noted the importance of using observation 
systems to help us to prevent the loss of 
life and property and be better stewards of the 
oceans. One of my priorities in the coming 
year will be to continue pushing for implementation 
of the U.S. Commission recommendations. 


Millions of people were left homeless and 
facing terrifying obstacles as a result of this 
tsunami. But I hope they can take some solace 
in knowing that people across the globe 
stand in solidarity with them. Not only have 
governments promised extensive support, but 
private citizens everywhere are digging into 
their own pockets to give what they can. This 
outpouring of generosity and compassion is 
amazing and reaffirming. No matter cultural 
differences or physical distance, in times of 
crisis we always come together to help one 
another. As the New Year begins, I pray for 
the quick recovery of those affected by the 
disaster and hope that the compassion shown 
during this crisis continues far into the future. 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to support the resolution and join all 

Americans in an expression of condolences to 
the people and countries that have been devastated 
by last week’s tsunami. In particular, I 
want to offer my personal sympathy to: Ambassador 
Sen of India, Ambassador 
Brotodiningrat of Indonesia, Ambassador 
Subasinghe of Sri Lanka, and Ambassador 
Piromya of Thailand. 

Tsunamis are walls of water that inundate 
coastal areas with little or no warning, often 
taking many lives and causing extensive property 
damage. They are initiated by sudden underwater 
disruptions and in this regard they 
differ from wind generated waves because the 
power they pack is not limited to the surface. 
Tsunamis are usually started as a result of an 
undersea earthquake, which for years was 
considered to be the sole cause of tsunamis. 
Research is now showing that tsunami generation 
involves intricate interactions between 
earthquakes, landslides, and sympathetic vibrations 
between the quake and the ocean 
above it. 

Tsunamis have been known since 426 B.C., 
and between 1990 and 2001 there were 11 
major tsunami events in the Pacific Rim, killing 
over 4,000 people and causing hundreds of 
millions in property damage. Before this week, 
the most devastating tsunami occurred in 
1755 in the Atlantic which killed 60,000 people 
and destroyed much of Lisbon. By comparison, 
the death toll from the Banda Aceh tsunami 
could exceed 150,000 on top of the unthinkable 
numbers of displaced, orphaned, 
and injured. Subsequent disease and untreated 
injuries will undoubtedly add to these 
statistics. 

The President has already pledged $350 
million in direct support to the affected countries 
on top of the medical, infrastructure, and 
logistics support from the U.S. Military. I want 
to encourage my colleagues in the Congress 
to work together as we did last fall to provide 
nearly $14 billion in relief to the Southeastern 
states and Caribbean nations following the 
four devastating hurricanes. 

Former Presidents Clinton and Bush are 
leading the Nation’s private fundraising activities, 
and I want to ask all Americans, to contribute 
whatever they can to the relief efforts 
for what is likely history’s most deadly natural 
disaster. 

Beyond these immediate needs, I want to 
encourage you to work with me in developing 
programs that will help to minimize losses suffered 
in future natural disasters. The National 
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration 
and the U.S. Geological Survey lead the 
United States in the research, monitoring, and 
warning of tsunamis and other natural disasters. 
For example, the Deep-ocean Assessment 
and Reporting of Tsunamis Project 
(DART) can detect ocean level anomalies as 
small as 1/2 inch in 20,000 feet of water to determine 
if a tsunami event is occurring in the 
deep sea. This system was useful to avoid a 
false alarm in response to an Alaskan earthquake 
in 2001. DART stations cost about 
$250,000 to purchase and around $125,000 
per year to maintain. Stations are now located 
off the coasts of Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, 
and Chile, but we need to consider how this 
system can be expanded to other parts of the 
world. 

Even with detection systems such as DART, 
notification alarms and awareness programs 
must be implemented for them to be effective. 
The first waves took 2–3 hours to hit Phuket 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H45 

(Thailand), Sri Lanka, and India after the initiating 
quakes. Even a few minutes of warning 
can make a huge difference if preceded with 
the proper awareness training. For example a 
1993 tsunami followed an earthquake in Japan 
by a mere 6 minutes. Although 200 people 
perished, 1,200 people escaped the waves by 
running inland as soon as they felt the shaking. 


Research on the causes of tsunamis is also 
needed. One of the most severe tsunamis in 
recent history occurred in Papua New Guinea 
in July 1998. The initiating earthquake was 
unexceptional at a magnitude of 7.1—the size 
of an earthquake that strikes somewhere in 
the world about every 3 weeks. Geological 
modeling strongly suggested that the quake 
caused an underwater landslide that together 
triggered the exceptional size tsunami. Other 
preliminary research indicates that under 
some conditions, tsunamis may be detectable 
from aircraft or satellites using radar or 
radiometers miles away from coastal areas. 

In this regard, I look forward to working with 
the Science Committee to identify opportunities 
for natural disaster detection and warning, 
and I look forward to hearing tomorrow’s briefing 
from Dr. David Applegate from USGS and 
General D.L. Johnson from NOAA. 

In addition to these financial and research 
initiatives, I want to remind my colleagues of 
the friends and families of the victims within 
the United States who also need our assistance. 


Many national from affected countries that 
reside in the United States on either a permanent 
or temporary basis. Some have no one 
left to provide monetary support and no home 
due to demolition by the violent waves and 
flooding. It is in the spirit of rebuilding and 
internationalism that I will introduce legislation 
to give nationals from affected countries that 
reside in the United States an opportunity to 
establish eligibility for Temporary Protected 
Status (TPS). 

This legislation would grant TPS to eligible 
nationals from specified countries who presently 
reside in the United States. TPS relief 
under this proposal will provide a necessary 
but temporary respite from deportation that will 
permit eligible applicants to work and live lawfully 
in the United States pending the restoration 
of a habitable homeland that is not laden 
with disease. Additionally, this proposal will 
allow eligible aliens to travel abroad and to return 
to the United States and be treated the 
same as any returning alien provided TPS— 
which will be helpful to family members of tsunami 
victims. I ask all of you to support this 
legislation and to join together in pledging the 
maximum level of resources to make the recovery 
of the affected areas expedient. 

Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I join my House 
colleagues in extending condolences to the 
victims of the earthquake and tsunamis that 
recently battered South and Southeast Asia as 
well as parts of East Africa. Generated by a 
magnitude 9.0 earthquake on December 26, 
massive tsunamis devastated whole villages in 
Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and India. 

The degree of this calamity has shocked 
and saddened all Americans, and I am 
pleased that through their representatives, the 
American people have an opportunity to formally 
express their grief for the more than 
150,000 people who perished. 

Our sorrow for those lost, however, should 
not distract us from the immediate humani


tarian crisis gripping the region. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) has suggested 
that between three to five million people lack 
basic survival requirements, including access 
to clean water, adequate shelter, food, sanitation, 
and health care. 

The WHO is also warning of an imminent 
health crisis, as contaminated water sources 
increase the risk of cholera, dysentery, malaria, 
and dengue fever. 

As the world community responds to this 
natural disaster, I hope and expect that the 
United States Government and the American 
people will be on the forefront of efforts to provide 
immediate and long-term aid. President 
Bush has so far committed $350 million for 
disaster relief, and I am hopeful that this 
amount will increase as we get a clearer picture 
of the devastation that has taken place. 

In the meantime, U.S. Government agencies 
are on the ground. The U.S. Air Force has 
transported 43,000 lbs of food, supplies, and 
equipment to the region, and helicopters from 
the USS Abraham Lincoln are shuttling supplies 
into northern Sumatra. The Defense Department 
is deploying Navy and Marine Corps 
supply ships and dispatching military medical 
teams to the most isolated and hard-hit areas. 

In addition, USAID, the federal agency responsible 
for the distribution of foreign aid, is 
now assessing the damage and individual 
country needs. These assessments will help 
better direct the emergency aid that is already 
flowing to the region. USAID will also identify 
the long-term goals to rebuild local economies, 
housing and infrastructure. 

The President has also enlisted former 
Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton 
to lead nationwide private fundraising efforts 
which are sure to generate large amounts of 
private donations. The American people are 
compassionate, and they will certainly give 
generously to help tsunami victims regain their 
health and their livelihoods. 

My thoughts and prayers go out to all those 
impacted by the tsunamis, including the estimated 
5,000 Americans in the region who 
have not yet been heard from. I urge my colleagues 
to support this resolution. 

Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with 
a heavy heart to share my condolences with 
the victims of the tsunami in South Asia. The 
magnitude of destruction and devastation left 
in the wake of this tragic disaster is incomprehensible. 
I join all Americans who are heartbroken 
by the images of towns and villages 
washed away and of the thousands of orphaned 
children who will grow up as survivors 
of this disaster. 

As the United States and the international 
community work to provide relief for the victims 
of this tragedy, I urge my colleagues to 
ensure that our efforts to assist in the reconstruction 
not be short-lived. While it is imperative 
that we immediately provide the necessary 
funds for relief work and humanitarian 
aid, we must ensure that as we assist in this 
recovery effort, and provide long term assistance 
to rebuild the infrastructure and communities 
devastated by this disaster. Beyond financial 
and humanitarian assistance, the 
United States must lead an international effort 
to implement a global tsunami warning and 
detection system so we can avoid future tragedies. 


During this time of recovery, governments 
and citizens from around the world have 
worked together to help those in need, regard


less of politics, race and religion. It is my sincere 
hope that out of this tragic situation a 
lasting spirit of cooperation and mutual respect 
can emerge. Hopefully this unprecedented cooperation 
can be used as a trigger to 
jumpstart the prospects for peace and coexistence 
throughout the region. 

My thoughts and prayers are with the victims 
and their families. 

Mr. DELAY. Mr. Speaker, it is a peculiar and 
embarrassing mark of man’s fallen nature that 
so often it takes tragedy for human beings to 
see past our differences and into each others’ 
hearts. Two weeks ago, a tragedy of incomprehensible 
magnitude struck our brothers and 
sisters on the other side of the world. It was 
the day after Christmas, actually, when much 
of the world was still celebrating, that an 
earthquake beneath the Indian Ocean set off 
massive tsunamis that have devastated island 
and coastal countries in southeast Asia and 
east Africa. The sum total of those killed, injured, 
diseased, and orphaned by the tsunami 
is larger than the populations of many countries. 
And yet, it is also a mark of the dignity 
of man that, in the face of such tragedy, we 
do see beyond our differences—cultural, political, 
religious—and see to it, with all our 
strength, that right is done. 

The tsunami’s waters will recede, Mr. 
Speaker, but the waves of prayers, love, and 
generous support—already making their way 
over the ocean—will not. Nor will the attention 
of the world—nor the attention of this body— 
until the victim nations recover. 

As we meet today, millions of people have 
been displaced from their homes and communities, 
and millions more are without the basic 
needs of survival—food, shelter, clean water, 
and health care. Countless children have lost 
their parents, and are now at the mercy of, at 
best, the crippled social institutions of their 
homelands, and at worst, we now learn, 
human traffickers. When faced by devastation 
and misery of this magnitude, when we see 
the grief of parents who had to choose which 
of their children to save, or hear stories of entire 
villages destroyed by the waves, there 
seems so little we can do. 

But on the contrary, Mr. Speaker, there is 
so much we must do. President Bush has 
pledged $350 million in relief and recovery assistance, 
dispatched Secretary of State Powell 
and Florida Governor Bush to the region to 
assess the situation, and tasked former Presidents 
Clinton and Bush to lead American fund 
raising for the relief effort. Thousands of our 
armed forces and America’s civilian relief 
agencies are already on the scene helping the 
relief effort—transporting food, medical supplies, 
mobile hospitals, and water-purifying 
equipment to the scene. And the generosity of 
the American people will continue to lead the 
way in the recovery, and in the effort to mitigate 
the long-term consequences of the disaster. 
The waters will recede, and life will one 
day return to normal. All humanity’s mission is 
to bring that day about before another life is 
needlessly lost. And the world should know 
that the American people and their Congress 
will help until no more help is needed. 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to express my most sincere condolences to 
everyone affected by the devastating tsunami 
that ravaged Southeast Asia on December 26. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to those who 
perished that day and to their families. 

The destructive tsunami that shook Southeast 
Asia claimed the lives of over 156,000. 


H46 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

Just this morning, I read the heart-wrenching 
story of a 13-year-old boy in Indonesia who 
lost his father, mother, and brother to the 
shocking natural disaster. Countless other 
families have been altered: thousands of children 
have lost their mothers and fathers, parents 
have lost their sons and daughters, men 
and women have lost their husbands and 
wives. The world has not seen a tragedy of 
this magnitude in decades, and my heart 
breaks for those who grieve the death of their 
family and friends. 

Despite the horrendous impact of this overwhelming 
tragedy, I am moved by the international 
outpouring of support and compassion 
to help the tsunami victims as they struggle 
to overcome the loss of loved ones and 
piece their lives together. The people of the 
world and of Southeast Asia have come together 
to take care of one another. Strangers, 
who themselves are struggling to find sufficient 
food and clean water, are taking in orphans 
who lost their families. International aid 
workers from countries, rich and poor, and 
large and small, have traveled to Southeast 
Asia to help provide essential materials to tsunami 
victims. 

Back in my district, a telethon hosted by a 
local television station along with efforts of the 
local branch of the American Red Cross 
helped Rochesterians raise $365,000 to help 
fund the disaster relief efforts. In Buffalo, various 
religious organizations have come together 
to raise money. The India Association 
of Buffalo raised $38,000 in a benefit held last 
Thursday and plans to continue fundraising. 

The number of people attempting to give 
money overwhelmed charity organizations collecting 
money for tsunami relief. Donations 
have ranged from $10 to thousands of dollars, 
and people from all economic brackets are 
giving what they can to help alleviate the suffering 
of their fellow fathers, mothers, husbands, 
wives, and children. 

When speaking of international natural disaster 
relief, President Dwight Eisenhower once 
said, ‘‘These are deeds of peace. They speak 
more loudly than promises or protestations of 
peaceful intent.’’ I hope that the worldwide 
generosity will continue until the need no 
longer exists, and that the solidarity among 
people from around the world will persist. 

Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise representing the great people of South 
Florida and join with them in extending our 
most heartfelt condolences and thoughts to 
the people who have been devastated by the 
most recent tsunami in Asia. We offer them 
our prayers. 

Mr. Speaker, as the world continues to 
focus on the wrath of this dreadful disaster, it 
is important to remember the people who have 
perished. It is important to help the people 
who have survived and are now picking up the 
pieces and restarting their lives. 

Across 11 nations, over 155,000 people are 
dead and millions were left homeless. These 
incredulous numbers, rising by the day, hide 
the human facet of this appalling disaster. 
Countless images of men and women holding 
their children tight, frantically running towards 
the helicopters with aid. Never-ending lines of 
families hoping for clean water and food. 
Thousands upon thousands of men, women 
and children desperately looking among the 
rubble upon what was once their homes and 
lives. 

Mr. Speaker, this catastrophe is one of unbelievable 
magnitude and challenges all na


tions to join in the relief efforts. I am proud of 
our brave men and women in the military who 
are currently manning the lifeline to the devastated 
regions. From the crew of the USS 
Lincoln to the Seahawk pilots, these young 
Americans continue to show the generosity— 
the heart and conscience of—our Nation. I am 
also tremendously proud of the volunteers 
across the globe who, in a moment’s notice, 
picked up and journeyed to Asia to help in any 
way they could. I applaud President Bush’s 
decision to call upon former Presidents Clinton 
and Bush to raise money for victims. 

As we know Mr. Speaker, the greatest 
source of America’s generosity—our essence—
is not our government; it’s the heart of 
the American people. I call upon all Americans 
to give and give generously to organizations 
that are on the ground, helping the countless 
victims in the devastated region. In South Florida, 
organizations such as the American Red 
Cross of Greater Miami & The Keys, The Association 
of Indians in America, Catholic Charities 
of the Archdiocese of Miami, and the 
Greater Miami Jewish Federation; to name a 
few. 

Mr. Speaker, we in Congress also have an 
obligation to help the people who have been 
devastated by the tsunami. As the newly selected 
co-chair of the India Caucus, I am confident 
that Congress will do its part in bringing 
assistance to the peoples of the regions that 
were hit. In India itself Mr. Speaker, the government 
increased its death toll to 9,571 dead 
and also raised its missing total to 5,914 people 
missing. As horrific as these numbers are, 
it is encouraging to hear of the joint cooperation 
between our two peoples and nations. 
The joint cooperation between the two nations 
to aid the people of India is clearly evident Mr. 
Speaker, as the Navies of India and the 
United States continue to work together and 
share information. America stands ready to aid 
the people of India. 

Again, I would like to extend our deep condolence 
to the families of the many earthquake 
and tsunami victims. We also affirm our 
commitment to the peoples of the affected regions 
and urge continued attention by relief 
agencies to the needs of the vulnerable populations. 
Our prayers and thoughts are with the 
victims of this horrible devastation. 

Mr. ACKERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the resolution expressing support 
and condolences to the victims of the earthquake 
and tsunami in South and Southeast 
Asia. I also want to commend Chairman HYDE 
and Ranking Member LANTOS for their leadership 
on the resolution. 

Mr. Speaker, the people of South and 
Southeast Asia are faced with a natural disaster 
of an unprecedented scale. Over 
150,000 people are dead and the World 
Health Organization estimates that between 3 
and 5 million people are lacking basic survival 
requirements. Unfortunately, these numbers 
seem to rise with each passing day. Our condolences 
and prayers go out to all of those 
who have been affected by this deeply personal 
tragedy. But beyond our prayers, the 
people affected will need the assistance of the 
international community to prevent the outbreak 
of disease which threatens to take as 
many lives as the tsunami. 

The humanitarian response by the affected 
governments, the United Nations, and NGOs 
working in the region has been impressive in 
the face of tremendous need and daunting lo


gistics. The outpouring of private contributions 
from all over the world should reaffirm our 
faith in humanity. But the magnitude of the 
need will remain long after the initial humanitarian 
response has provided people with shelter, 
food, clean water, and medical care. 

The $2 billion already pledged by the United 
States and other donors is an excellent down-
payment, but I think we are only beginning to 
glimpse the massive undertaking that reconstruction 
will be. I hope that the House will 
rapidly consider the legislation that Chairman 
HYDE and Mr. LANTOS are working on to provide 
substantial emergency assistance to the 
affected survivors, to help them rebuild their 
homes and their lives. 

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support 
the resolution and to commit themselves 
to supporting the additional relief we can certainly 
expect to be necessary. 

Mr. MEEKS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to offer my condolences to the hundreds 
of thousands affected by the tsunami in 
Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Somalia, 
Malaysia, and other countries. 

December 26 will ever be a day etched in 
our memories and in our hearts as we struggle 
to comprehend the magnitude of loss associated 
with this disaster. 

Our great country is often viewed as a leader 
in the world and I know that the President 
will ensure that our country maintains this role 
by mobilizing the necessary humanitarian and 
economic assistance for both immediate and 
long-term relief, whether it be the $350 million 
already pledged or more as each day brings 
us a deeper understanding of the total impact 
of this disaster. 

We have long held prosperous relationships 
on economic and security issues with many of 
the countries that have been affected such as 
India and Malaysia. 

If we fail to adequately meet the needs of 
those affected by committing to advancing a 
strong recovery in both the Asian and African 
nations that have been affected, the long-term 
worldwide economic and political consequences 
of this natural disaster could be 
even more severe. 

Mr. CARDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express 
my deepest condolences and support to those 
affected by the earthquake-generated 
tsunamis that struck numerous countries in 
South Asia and East Africa on December 26, 
2004. This enormous natural disaster, which 
has so far claimed more than 150,000 lives, 
including many Americans, requires a robust 
response from the international community. 

I am pleased that the United States is taking 
a leading role in the relief and recovery efforts. 
We should continue to partner with the United 
Nations, non-governmental organizations, and 
other members of the international community 
to render humanitarian assistance throughout 
the region. I look forward to working in Congress 
to increase America’s contributions to 
this effort as additional needs required for 
long-term rebuilding are identified. 

Over the past 10 days, the outpouring of 
condolences and financial support from the 
American people has been tremendous. The 
efforts of the thousands of Americans who are 
giving of their time, money, and resources are 
truly reflective of the American spirit, and they 
exemplify our Nation’s values and ideals. I join 
with my colleagues today in support of the 
House resolution. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H47 

Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay 
my respects and give my deepest condolences 
to those who have suffered through 
one of the worst natural disasters in history. 

As our nation celebrated the holiday season 
with our loved ones, a tragedy of epic proportions 
was occurring half a world away. An 
earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 off the 
coast of Indonesia triggered a massive tsunami 
that engulfed several countries throughout 
South and Southeast Asia. The total aftermath 
is not yet known as the number of lives 
lost continues to rise to immeasurable levels. 

Though this tragic disaster destroyed lives, 
families, and entire economies, it did not destroy 
the strength of character and sense of 
purpose displayed by the victims who continue 
to fight daily for survival. The victims of this 
tsunami are not alone in their struggle. Across 
our great Nation, Americans, together with the 
world community, have exhibited their generosity 
of spirit as they pray for the suffering 
families and continue to give monetary assistance 
to those in need. 

More than 150,000 people have been killed 
with millions more affected. These numbers 
are already impossible to comprehend yet 
countless others are missing. 

We are now presented with a defining historical 
moment as a nation and as an international 
community. We must share the fiscal 
and emotional burden that will only get worse 
for our brothers and sisters in Southeast Asia. 
We cannot under-fund, undercut, or undermine 
our relief efforts by failing to follow 
through on our promises as a government or 
our compassion as Americans. 

9/11 will always be remembered in our nation 
as a time of crisis and devastation, yet 
also a time of perseverance and unity. We 
survived this horrific event because of the resolve 
exhibited by our Nation’s people and the 
support received from the international community. 
The tragedy that has struck Southeast 
Asia is no less of a crisis and no less devastating. 


It is the responsibility of the United States 
and the world community to continue the aid 
and assistance of these countries during their 
time of need. During times of crises are when 
the integrity of a nation and its people are 
judged in history. I am encouraged by the 
overwhelming response and generosity shown 
by the people across this world. It is the 
human way to respond; it is the American way 
to respond. 

Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
RENZI). Without objection, the previous 
question is ordered on the resolution. 

There was no objection. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the resolution. 

The resolution was agreed to. 

A motion to reconsider was laid on 

the table. 

f 

EXPRESSING SORROW OF THE 
HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE 
HONORABLE ROBERT T. MATSUI, 
MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM 
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I offer a 
privileged resolution (H. Res. 11) and 
ask for its immediate consideration. 

The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: 


H. RES. 11 

Resolved, That the House has heard with 
profound sorrow of the death of the Honorable 
Robert T. Matsui, a Representative 
from the State of California. 

Resolved, That a committee of such Members 
of the House as the Speaker may designate, 
together with such Members of the 
Senate as may be joined, be appointed to attend 
the funeral. 

Resolved, That the Sergeant-at-Arms of the 
House be authorized and directed to take 
such steps as may be necessary for carrying 
out the provisions of these resolutions and 
that the necessary expenses in connection 
therewith be paid out of applicable accounts 
of the House. 

Resolved, That the Clerk communicate 
these resolutions to the Senate and transmit 
a copy thereof to the family of the deceased. 

Resolved, That when the House adjourns 
today, it adjourn as a further mark of respect 
to the memory of the deceased. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman 
from California (Mr. STARK) is 
recognized for 1 hour. 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
minutes to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. DREIER), pending which I 
yield myself such time as I may consume. 


GENERAL LEAVE 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on this resolution. 


The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentleman 
from California? 

There was no objection. 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, as the dean 
of the California delegation, I offer this 
privileged resolution expressing the 
profound sorrow of all of us within the 
House of Representatives at BOB MATSUI’s 
passing. I am honored to sponsor 
this resolution in an attempt to memorialize 
BOB’s contributions to Congress 
and to our Nation. 

Like all of us, I was shocked to hear 
the news that someone as vibrant as 
BOB MATSUI is no longer with us. He 
has been a forceful leader in Congress, 
and he will be missed. I will miss his 
counsel and his friendship, having been 
honored to serve with him during his 
time in Congress as a fellow Californian 
and on the Committee on Ways 
and Means. 

But first of all, my thoughts and condolences 
go to his family, BOB’s wife 
Doris, his son Brian, daughter-in-law 
Amy, and granddaughter Anna. 

I just got around I guess to opening 
his Christmas card a day or so before 
the sad news came and was reminded of 
a night early on when Brian, who is 
now an adult with an adult life, and he 
could not have been more than 5 or 6 at 
the time, and he was at a reception 
with BOB and Doris and myself and 
choked on a chicken bone, and the consternation 
we all had, patting Brian on 
the back and getting him through the 
chicken bone incident. So as I say to 
Brian and to Doris, BOB’s memory will 
live with them and give them great 
support as they move ahead in their 
lives. 

In his time here, BOB demonstrated 
and embodied the utmost integrity. He 
knew and understood the purpose, the 
greater purpose, really, which we in 
the House are entrusted with. He lived 
by and set high standards in public 
service. In a word, he was a statesman. 
He went through the experience of 
being interned during World War II, 
and it never made him bitter. He never 
lost his spirit. Rather, it gave him resolve 
for his own convictions and his 
sense of public service. 

He started in Sacramento after a 
brief career in law, and then he came 
to Congress in 1979, starting out with 
the Committee on the Judiciary and 
then with the Committee on Government 
Operations, and then later joining 
the Committee on Ways and Means 
where he really became our resident 
expert on Social Security and was active 
in trade and tax policy issues as 
well. He tackled those issues, as I am 
sure any of my colleagues who have 
discussed Social Security with him 
know, with sharp intellect, deep convictions, 
and compassion for what was 
right. But he was fair. He had a sense 
of humility and one of respect I think 
of his colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle. 

I do know one thing, that BOB MATSUI 
would have wanted to be here to 
lead the Democrats in the fight to protect 
Social Security in this coming session 
of Congress. He was prepared for 
it. He was geared up for it. He had been 
spending his time over the last several 
weeks before his sad passing to lead us 
in the effort to protect Social Security. 
His convictions of compassion mark his 
work on behalf of disadvantaged children 
and families in our country as 
well. 

BOB championed expanded health 
care coverage for children and was a 
tireless advocate for child welfare. Indeed, 
he joined many of us in opposing 
our own administration during the welfare 
reform issues in 1996, and he introduced 
key legislation to expand job 
training and education programs to 
help people in poverty. We lost that 
battle in 1996, but he remained steadfast 
in his commitment to ensure that 
people got lifted out of poverty, not 
just kicked off the welfare rolls. 

So as the new year began, I had 
looked forward to his counsel and 
working with him side-by-side as it 
were on our committee on important 
issues. 

His spirit will continue to inspire us 
in the days ahead and with gratitude 
for all he has done, we will carry on his 
work and do all we can to honor his life 
and his contributions to the American 
people. I know that the House tonight 
will adjourn in his honor, and on New 
Year’s he adjourned sine die. We say so 
long, old friend. 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

Mr. Speaker, let me begin by expressing 
my appreciation to my California 


H48 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

colleague (Mr. STARK). We have worked 
jointly on this resolution, and it is 
with a great deal of sadness obviously 
that we are here at this moment. 

We just completed the debate on the 
resolution that had to do with the loss 
of now it appears about 150,000 lives 
from the tsunami that has taken place 
in South and Southeast Asia. And then 
we come to the next resolution, talking 
about one man, an individual who has 
made a great contribution. And when 
you juxtapose the resolution with the 
loss of 150,000 lives and now we are 
talking about BOB MATSUI, we cannot 
help but think about the fragility of 
life. 

BOB MATSUI is an individual who offered 
so much to this institution, but 
he offered so much to me personally, 
just as I know he did to others of my 
colleagues who are going to be speaking 
tonight and many of those who are 
not going to be able to be here this 
evening. 

b 1900 
The gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. PELOSI) in her statement when she 
was turning the gavel over to the gentleman 
from Illinois (Speaker 
HASTERT) this morning I think said it 
very well when she talked about the 
combination of intellect and passion 
that BOB MATSUI demonstrated in his 
life. 
We all know that BOB was a tremendous 
intellect, very thoughtful, very 
deliberative on issues that he tackled, 
but he also at the same time had a 
deeply felt passion in the pursuit of his 
agenda, and I will tell my colleagues 
that I shared that agenda in some 
areas and I shared his passion. I do not 
know that I have quite the intellect 
that BOB had, but I shared his passion. 
We worked together through the 
1980s and the 1990s in pursuit of the 
global trade agenda, and I know there 
is a lot of controversy in this House on 
that issue, but BOB and I worked arm 
in arm to try and get Bill Clinton trade 
promotion authority. I remember the 
kind of energy and the thought that 
BOB put into this, and he had boundless 
energy when it came to this. He was a 
slight person, but boy, I will tell my 
colleagues, when he put his mind to an 
issue, he really was very, very diligent 
in pursuit of that. 
We worked together on a wide range 
of individual trade agreements, going 
back to the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. Every single year, 
BOB MATSUI and I worked together to 
try and grant what we used to call 
most-favored nation trading status for 
the People’s Republic of China, and 
then ultimately we worked together on 
the granting of permanent normal 
trade relations. 
I happen to believe that that vision 
that BOB had was a very positive one 
and has played a big role in improving 
the quality of life and the standard of 
living for people all over the world, and 
I think that when we look at this institution 
it is a tragic irony, I mean, that 

this has come. We are not only sad but 
we are very shocked. 

The gentleman from California (Mr. 
STARK) and I, Mr. Speaker, were just 
talking about the news and what BOB 
went through at the end because it did 
come as a great surprise to him and to 
Doris and to Brian and Amy and little 
Anna that he was going in for a checkup, 
and then it ended up, of course, 
that because of this infection he was 
going to not survive. So when this news 
came out it was a shock to all of us. 

I heard it just as I was getting on the 
airplane to fly back here on Sunday, 
and I was just taken and I could not 
help but think about immediately all 
of the great experiences that I had 
traveling, working on joint California 
issues, working, as I said, on the trade 
agenda and realizing how dedicated 
this guy was and what a horrible loss 
this will be for this institution and for 
us as individuals. 

So I join, as the gentleman from California 
(Mr. STARK) has just said, in extending 
personally my thoughts and 
prayers to Doris and Brian and his family 
as well. We all got that picture of 
their family that was just sent to us, 
and we could not help but be moved 
seeing that photograph of them, knowing 
what a wonderful, wonderful family 
they are. 

I just have to say that I am very, 
very saddened, and my thought and 
prayers go to those family members. 
We have learned how fragile life truly 
is. 

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. THOMPSON). 

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
California (Mr. STARK) for the time. 

Mr. Speaker, I am both saddened and 
honored to rise today in memory of our 
friend BOB MATSUI. We can barely 
glimpse a man’s greatness in a single 
floor statement, but I will try. 

American heroes have customarily 
run toward towering figures of many 
words, but today, our Chamber and our 
Nation honors a man whose contribution 
was not the quantity and volume 
of words but, rather, the quality and 
the effectiveness of both his spirit and 
his skill. 

Many will speak from the floor tonight 
of the landmark, legislative 
achievements of this extraordinary 
man. Many more will honor his lifetime 
of legislative victories and how 
they directly improved the lives of millions 
of Americans spanning several 
generations. Single mothers with infants. 
Civil rights. Our Nation’s most 
vulnerable seniors. BOB provided more 
than a voice for those who could not 
speak for themselves. He provided victory. 
He provided results. He won monumental 
battles, not by being the loudest 
but by being the smartest and the 
most informed person in the debate. 

The Greeks have told us that death is 
hardest on those it leaves behind. This 

House has lost a rare statesman. Doris, 
Brian, Amy and Anna have lost a devoted 
and loving husband, father and 
grandfather. I have lost a mentor and 
my best friend in this Congress, and 
our Nation has lost a tireless, compassionate 
and brilliant leader. To the 
Members I say, in the year that lies 
ahead of us, let us make sure that this 
Chamber is worthy of his grace and his 
legacy. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. DOOLITTLE), 
my very good friend from 
Rocklin. 

Mr. DOOLITTLE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman very much for the 
time. 

Mr. Speaker, while I, like our other 
colleagues, was really shocked to learn 
of this sad news, I think it was exactly 
a month ago today on the final day of 
the 108th Congress that BOB and I exchanged 
a warm greeting in the elevator, 
wished each other happy holidays 
and fully expected to see him back here 
with all the rest of us starting out 
today in the 109th Congress. 

I had the privilege of representing 
the adjoining region to BOB MATSUI, 
who represented the City of Sacramento 
and certain surrounding 
areas. He and I got to know each other 
pretty well. We had some real contentious 
issues, one specific contentious 
issue that the Chamber is aware of 
dealing with water supply and flood 
control in our region, and we battled 
over that for a long time. 

BOB was a fearless advocate for his 
constituency, and it always impressed 
me as we went through this process of 
advocating our points of view and coming 
to the realization that we would be 
best served by trying to find some common 
ground and putting that into law. 
We got to know each other on a personal 
basis, and it was really a delightful 
experience. I think our constituents 
assumed we were bitter enemies, but 
that was not the case. The disagreements 
were never personal, and we actually 
became friends, and I always enjoyed 
seeing him. 

I knew he was a good family man. He 
cared a great deal about that, and from 
time to time we would sit back there in 
the back rows and visit with each other 
a little bit about that. He was very 
proud of his son Brian, first love Doris 
a great deal, and proud of his daughter-
in-law and of his new granddaughter, 
relatively new, 16 months old I believe. 

Like the gentleman from California 
(Mr. STARK), I was opening that Christmas 
card myself, well, just last week in 
Rocklin. That was one of the ones I 
saw, big beautiful card and filled with 
pictures of his family, and he was a 
very committed man, a very effective 
representative. 

Sacramento has a lot today because 
of work that he did, a lot of fine accomplishments 
from improving the airport 
to light rail taking off, getting 
started with him, and developing and 
extending the lines and so forth, the 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H49 

massive amount of flood control work 
on the levies and so forth that is going 
on, a lot. He has left quite a legacy. 

I shall miss him and I am truly sorry 
that this has happened. It is a shocking 
event, and my prayers are with Doris 
and Brian and Amy, his daughter-in-
law, and Anna, the granddaughter. I 
thank my colleagues for this opportunity 
to offer my thoughts. 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. WAXMAN). 

Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is 
very difficult to come to terms with 
BOB’s loss. It was a shock and so tragic. 
He was kind and decent beyond measure. 
He put a human face on the all too 
often theoretical debates on health 
care, Social Security, child welfare and 
tax policy, and he was always a voice 
of reason. 

BOB cared about the challenges real 
people faced, children in foster care, 
workers struggling for a fair shot and 
seniors whose Social Security checks 
make the difference between life in or 
out of poverty. 

In 1988, BOB helped the Nation come 
to terms with the terrible wrong our 
government committed against Japanese 
Americans during World War II. 
BOB and his family were forced into an 
internment camp when he was 6 
months old. His parents were both 
U.S.-born citizens, but they lost their 
home and family business during the 
three-and-a-half years their family was 
interned. 

BOB became the first Japanese American 
elected to the Sacramento City 
Council and one of the first Japanese 
Americans in Congress. He spent his 
career fighting injustice. Among his 
many efforts, he established a task 
force I was privileged to co-chair with 
him to give Members of Congress with 
diverse backgrounds a better understanding 
of the grave threats that 
Israel and the Israeli people face. 

On a personal level, I considered BOB 
one of my closest friends in this institution. 
We spent time together, often 
when I took advantage of the fact that 
our Bethesda homes were close by each 
other and hitched a ride with him. 

I know BOB’s center of gravity was 
his family, his wife Doris, his son 
Brian, his daughter-in-law Amy and 
what he made clear was the most adorable 
granddaughter in the whole world, 
Anna. He was so proud of Brian and his 
accomplishments, his clerking for the 
Supreme Court of the United States 
and making more money in his first 
year in a law firm than even Members 
of the United States Congress. 

He cared deeply about his efforts to 
make a difference through public service 
and the principles and values of the 
Democratic Party, and this took him 
to the position of sacrifice as chairman 
of the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee. 

Janet and I were so grateful for our 
friendships over the decade with BOB 
and Doris. We want to extend our deep 
condolences to the family, the entire 

family during this sorrowful time. This 
is an enormous loss for his family, for 
his friends and for this entire country. 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
very distinguished gentleman from 
California (Mr. HERGER). 

Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from California for the 
time. 

Mr. Speaker, today we mourn a 
friend and able colleague. It is a tremendous 
loss to each of us and to our 
country. 

BOB MATSUI was someone that virtually 
everyone in the Sacramento 
area knew and respected. Indeed, I was 
not elected to Congress until 1986, almost 
10 years into BOB’s service in the 
House, but my wife Pam and I already 
knew BOB and his wife Doris. One really 
could not be from the Sacramento 
area and not know and have tremendous 
respect and admiration for the 
Matsuis and for their work in the community. 


As a representative of a congressional 
district to the north of Sacramento, 
I worked frequently with BOB 
on issues of regional importance to 
northern California. He was a passionate 
and effective advocate for his 
constituents on a myriad of issues, particularly 
on flood control, one of the 
most critically important issues for 
those of us who live in flood-prone 
northern California. 

He will certainly be remembered by 
all of us as a leader on these and many 
other issues important to the region 
and as an able and dedicated voice for 
his constituents. 

I also had the pleasure of serving 
with BOB for many years on the House 
Committee on Ways and Means. A 
long-time supporter of free trade, BOB 
was willing and determined to reach 
across the aisle and work together on 
the challenging issue of trade policy. 

b 1915 
He worked hard for policies that expanded 
trade, but that also ensured 
that it was fair and that the playing 
field was level for American companies 
and agricultural producers. Those efforts 
went a long way to helping expand 
economic opportunities for our 
northern California region as well as 
the Nation. 
In all his dealings, both public and 
private, BOB MATSUI personified integrity. 
It was an honor to have called 
him a friend. On behalf of my wife, 
Pam, and me, I would like to extend 
our personal, heartfelt condolences to 
the Matsui family, his wife, Doris; his 
son and daughter-in-law, Brian and 
Amy; and his granddaughter, Anna, for 
their tremendous loss. They can be 
proud knowing that their husband, father, 
and grandfather worked incredibly 
hard to serve the people he represented, 
always with the noblest of intentions 
and always with the level of 
intellectual honesty, ability and skill 
that commanded enormous respect 
from everyone who knew and worked 

with him. He will be greatly missed by 
all. 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. DOGGETT). 

Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me this 
time. 

I rise to join my colleagues in paying 
tribute to an extraordinary human 
being, BOB MATSUI. Like so many others 
across this country, the celebration 
of this new year was for me shaken by 
the incredibly sad news of BOB’s demise. 
I awoke this Sunday expecting to 
be consumed with the challenges and 
work of the new year, only to be 
stunned to learn of the passing of an 
old friend. 

Libby and I had only a couple of days 
before shared the beauty of BOB’s family 
that he and Doris send out each 
year at this time, reflecting on the last 
time we shared a meal with them, only 
a couple weeks before at a dinner table 
here in Washington, knowing of the 
pride that BOB felt in Doris’ professional 
accomplishments and how often 
he mentioned Doris and Brian and his 
family in conversations on subjects 
here in Washington. 

There is a Greek proverb: ‘‘The measure 
of man is what he does with 
power.’’ By this measure, or really by 
any measure, BOB was indeed a great 
human being. Although he had significant 
power here in Washington as a 
senior Member of this House, he was 
viewed as a soft-spoken advocate for 
the things that he believed in and the 
people he represented. And yet on more 
than one occasion I have seen his temper 
flare at injustice. 

BOB was a great and principled policymaker. 
He gave a great deal of 
thought to the issues and the decisions 
before he spoke, and often took positions 
that were not popular but that 
represented his principles. He also was 
willing to grow and adjust those principles, 
certainly being committed to 
more trade, and yet over time he recognized 
that trade was more than just 
counting how many widgets crossed 
country lines, but how that trade affects 
people. 

He was committed to not only Social 
Security but to retirement security, 
and took a very forceful stance in this 
House about the concern that we do 
more to help those who have no retirement, 
not just to add to the retirement 
of those who already have much. 

It was my good fortune to serve with 
him on the Committee on Ways and 
Means, to come on that committee as a 
new member and find BOB as someone 
that I could turn to when I had a problem 
for personal advice and always get 
a thoughtful hearing and sound advice. 

While his passing is most premature, 
we can only seek to renew our strength 
inspired by his very strong example, to 
remember the causes that he championed 
and how he championed them, 
and to be strengthened in our efforts 
by his spirit and his fight for fairness, 
to stand up for what is right for the 
American people. 


H50 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

It is fitting for us to honor BOB with 
our words, but certainly we must honor 
him in this Congress with our actions, 
to continue to champion the causes 
that he would champion and had so 
often, from this very microphone. Certainly 
that is true with regard to Social 
Security, as he stood up to those 
who would destabilize, privatize and 
piratize it. Without our ally, our work 
will be harder, our burden will be 
greater, and our responsibility will also 
be greater. 

As the Los Angeles Times editorialized 
about BOB recently, ‘‘He epitomized 
an ideal of public service that 
has largely vanished in a partisan Congress.’’ 


Mr. Speaker, we salute BOB by our 
deeds as well as our words tonight. 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
PEARCE). Without objection, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. HERGER) 
will control the time. 

There was no objection. 

Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. THOMAS), 
the chairman of the Committee on 
Ways and Means, a committee that BOB 
MATSUI served on for many years. 

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. Speaker, it is true 
that BOB and I were on the Committee 
on Ways and Means together; but, 
frankly, BOB and I go back a long way. 

This is especially difficult since just 
a very short time ago I was going 
through the Members’ Christmas cards. 
If you have been around a long time 
one tends to see the march of time in 
the cards. You get a very formal card 
from a new Member. Maybe he is not 
married. Or if married, it is just a very 
bright, young couple. Over the years, 
the family grows, not just in stature 
but in numbers. We just received one 
from the Matsui’s with a grandbaby 
prominently displayed. 

In 1978 in November in Sacramento, 
Members who had been elected to Congress 
in that election got together as 
Members-elect in Sacramento. I had 
known BOB by virtue of his being on 
the Sacramento City Council. I was an 
assemblyman at the time and of course 
spent some time in Sacramento. There 
were three other Democrats, colleagues 
in the assembly, Vic Fazio, Julian 
Dixon, and Tony Coelho who had been 
an aide to a Congressman and been 
elected in that same election. To show 
Members how much things do not 
change, one of the freshmen in that 
class was the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LUNGREN) who has joined us 
once again as a Member. Another member 
from the State Assembly who 
joined us that year, was the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LEWIS). 

All of us got together as newly elected 
Members from California. We stayed 
together because when you are in the 
same class, even if you are of a different 
party, you have common ties, 
notwithstanding the differences of policy 
positions that you take or oftentimes 
the different committee directions 
that you take. It was my privi


lege and pleasure to serve not only at 
the same time as BOB, but for a significant 
number of years on the same committee. 


He was, as we now know even more so 
than we thought, in many ways a very 
private person. It was, I think, personality 
as well as culture. But if one 
could get inside there, all of the comments 
that Members have made in a 
very public way were also true of the 
private person. You often wonder, as is 
the case with some Members, how BOB 
would get elected if he had to go out 
and be gregarious among people. But 
when one meets Doris, you figure out 
how he did it easily: he just kept her in 
front of him. As some people have said 
with my wife, Sharon, they understand 
better once they have met the spouse 
how you get elected. But the most important 
thing was the couple and the 
union they formed. 

One of the things that some of the 
newer Members need to realize is that 
what occurs in committee and on the 
floor is business, and people go about 
their business in different ways. The 
reason we are going to hear a number 
of Members talk about BOB in the way 
that we will talk about BOB is because 
if you spend a little time getting to 
know the other businessmen, you cannot 
help but get to know them as a person. 
All of us are lamenting the passing 
of Congressman BOB MATSUI, but those 
of us who knew the person of BOB MATSUI 
are perhaps lamenting even more. 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I yield for 
the purpose of making a unanimous 
consent request to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. HARMAN). 

(Ms. HARMAN asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend her remarks.) 


Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
tribute to a gentleman and a gentle 
man, BOB MATSUI. 

I will sorely miss my good friend and colleague 
BOB MATSUI. California and America 
have lost a champion for justice, Social Security, 
fair trade and opportunity for all. 

BOB’s courage was remarkable. Imprisoned 
in an internment camp as a young child, he 
worked to give freedom and dignity to others. 

Serving more than 25 years in the U.S. 
House of Representatives, most recently as a 
Senior Member of the powerful Ways and 
Means Committee, and Ranking Member of its 
Social Security Subcommittee, as well as 
Chairman of the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee, BOB was an unfailing 
gentleman and a loyal friend. 

I met him early in his House career. Long 
before I thought of running for Congress I consulted 
him, and he offered his support. 

Shortly thereafter, my key advisor and law 
firm colleague Vic Raiser died in a plane 
crash. BOB knew our relationship and called 
me. He said, ‘‘I cannot take Vic’s place, but I’ll 
sure try.’’ He made my race his top priority 
and personally contacted his donor base on 
my behalf. His efforts were critical to my victory 
and I referred to him thereafter as my 
‘‘mother.’’ 

At this time of sadness, my thoughts and 
prayers are with BOB’s extraordinary wife, 
Doris, son Brian and beautiful granddaughter, 

Anna. BOB leaves a huge void in this nation 
and a big hole in my heart. 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. RANGEL). 

Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
all Members for participating in this 
tribute to someone whom we all believe 
was our best friend. This is so 
very unusual in a Congress that does 
not allow us to meet often or travel 
very much together that each one of us 
treasures so much those special personal 
relationships that we have. 

At a time when hundreds of thousands 
of lives are being lost in Asia and 
in the Middle East, God has a way of 
reducing all of this and making it a lot 
more personal when it appears in the 
middle of the night. He just snatches 
away someone that you may have just 
taken for granted. Certainly the loss of 
BOB had everyone startled. How could a 
person with such fierce commitment to 
legislation and to the Congress who 
was so involved, and appeared to be 
looking so hard toward the next challenge, 
how could God have just 
snatched him away without any warning? 
But I have found over the years 
that it eases the pain, it does not remove 
it, but it eases the pain if during 
times like this you can think of how 
fortunate you were that in your lifetime 
you came across a person like BOB 
MATSUI. 

It also helps if you can thank God 
that you do not have to say I wish I 
had spent more time with him or I wish 
I had gotten to know him better or I 
wish I had told him how fond I was of 
him, or how much I appreciated his 
dedication to the committee, to the 
Congress, to the causes that he so truly 
believed in. And then it makes you feel 
a little better that you had a chance to 
say BOB MATSUI, we love you. 

It is hard for me to think of anyone 
that felt so strongly about his beliefs, 
and at the same time we hear over and 
over tonight that he was indeed a 
gentle man, how we can hear Members 
from both sides of the aisle saying we 
are human beings, we are dedicated, we 
do have different beliefs, but here was 
a guy who was able to take all of this 
and still manage to have friends on 
both sides of the aisle. 

b 1930 
Yes, the chairman of the Committee 
on Ways and Means is so correct, because 
we always felt that we had two 
Members as being friends, because 
Doris was a partner, she was a friend, 
she was a supporter and, of course, 
Brian and Amy, they all had an opportunity 
to share their love and dedication 
to their father, to her husband, before 
he left. He did not just walk away 
from our lives but in his classy way he 
said good-bye to the family and left us 
here in the Congress and especially us 
in the Democratic Caucus with such a 
sense of pride and feeling how proud we 
were to be able to have a person of his 
caliber not only politically being our 
leader but on the Committee on Ways 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H51 

and Means where so often we hear that 
he was an expert in Social Security 
legislation, but those of us who were 
privileged to serve on the committee 
knew that he was an expert in anything 
that came before the committee. 
He was an expert in trade, he was an 
expert in pensions, he was an expert in 
welfare issues. And not because he was 
just a good lawyer and a good lawmaker 
but because he was compassionate 
and understood where he came 
from and his commitment was trying 
to improve the quality of life of Americans 
and human beings all over. He 
never forgot the struggles that he and 
his family had gone through and he always 
led us to believe that we could 
achieve even things beyond our expectations 
in working with him. 

And so with all of this loss and in 
searching for something to thank God 
for doing, I can say I thank Him for 
sharing BOB with us and I thank Him 
for giving me the opportunity of having 
told BOB MATSUI how much I loved 
him. 

Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
at this point to yield 3 minutes on behalf 
of the Congressional Asian and Pacific 
Islanders Caucus to the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. WU). 

(Mr. WU asked and was given permission 
to revise and extend his remarks.) 

Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, today we stand 
together here in the people’s House to 
honor and mourn the loss of one of its 
true servants, BOB MATSUI. I am filled 
with sadness as we remember an outstanding 
Member of Congress, an inspiration 
to a generation of Asian Americans, 
a leader and a good friend. It is 
not only a loss for those of us who had 
the privilege to serve with him, not 
just a loss for Asian Americans but a 
loss for this Congress and all Americans. 
His wisdom and counsel will certainly 
be missed. Our thoughts and 
prayers are with his family during this 
time, with Doris, with Brian and Amy. 

BOB MATSUI believed in the value of 
public service. As a Congressman for 26 
years and as a city councilman and 
vice mayor of his beloved Sacramento 
before that, he understood that government 
had a positive role to play in people’s 
lives. Inspired by the calling of 
President Kennedy’s speech challenging 
Americans to ask what they 
could do for their country, BOB MATSUI 
dedicated his life to that challenge. 

BOB MATSUI was a mentor, a statesman 
and a role model. As a founding 
member of the Asian Pacific American 
Caucus, he was able to provide his insight 
and experience about the importance 
of public service and how to get 
the job done to many of us junior Members. 
Several members of that caucus 
join me today in honoring BOB MATSUI’s 
life and selfless service. 

As a senior member of the Committee 
on Ways and Means, BOB MATSUI 
was intricately involved in that 
committee’s complex portfolio and important 
public policy issues, including 

tax policy, international law and trade, 
Social Security, health care and welfare 
reform. Most notably in recent 
years, BOB fought to preserve Social 
Security because he believed that the 
elderly and the disabled are entitled to 
the stability of a guaranteed income 
that allows them to live in dignity. 
Many of us will miss his voice in the 
coming debates on the future of Social 
Security. 

Those of us who had the privilege to 
know BOB MATSUI and to serve with 
him will be forever in his debt. His intellect, 
his passion for justice, his dedication 
to the value of public service 
will continue to be guideposts for us 
all. BOB, wherever you are, it is a far, 
far better place now that you are there. 
Thank you for all the sound advice 
that I received from you over the 
years. My only regret is that I did not 
take a little bit more of it. Today we 
mourn the loss of a great man and a 
friend. He will be missed. 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LEE). 

Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise this 
evening to pay tribute to a great leader, 
to an extraordinary human being, 
our beloved BOB MATSUI. I rise with a 
heavy heart tonight as we remember 
BOB. I remember him as a fighter for 
justice, for our senior citizens, and for 
all those who have yet to realize the 
American dream. BOB’s quiet strength 
always amazed me. He was brilliant, 
yet he always listened and valued ideas 
and input from others. 

When I first ran for Congress, I remember 
that BOB came to my district 
and he helped me with my campaign 
with a variety of constituencies. Of 
course, my colleagues know I have a 
very vibrant port in my district and 
trade is such a critical issue. BOB 
taught me a lot about trade and helped 
me tremendously as we debated our 
trade policy in this body. Like myself, 
my constituents were inspired by BOB’s 
life as they got to know him, knowing 
that he spent his first formative years 
in an internment camp. But rather 
than turn bitter, BOB worked to ensure 
that those interned during those dark 
moments of American history were 
granted reparations for such a shameless 
act. BOB MATSUI used his personal 
experiences not in a selfish way but to 
heal the wounds of so many Japanese 
Americans and our entire country. For 
that, we owe him a debt of gratitude. 

Several years ago, BOB asked me to 
come to Sacramento to keynote the 
NAACP, I think it was the Sacramento 
NAACP’s annual Martin Luther King 
dinner. The respect and the love that 
BOB’s multiracial constituency had for 
him and for Doris was something to behold. 
He was the epitome of a public 
servant and his constituents knew it, 
year after year after year. 

As we move into this very critical debate 
to save Social Security, let us remember 
BOB’s commitment to save Social 
Security and to ensure that our 
seniors in their golden years live the 

life that they deserve. We will have to 
fight, of course, twice as hard now that 
we do not have BOB with us, but BOB 
would want us to do just that. May the 
insights and the inspiration that BOB 
MATSUI brought to this and so many of 
our debates guide us to do the right 
thing and to uphold his extraordinary 
legacy. To BOB’s loving family, to 
Doris, to Brian, Amy and Anna, my 
thoughts and my prayers are with you. 
Thank you for sharing this giant of a 
human being with all of us. Our country 
and the world is a better place. 
May his soul rest in peace. 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted 
to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. MENENDEZ), 
the chairman of the Democratic 
Caucus. 

Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding me this time. 

Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the 
Democratic Caucus, I rise to pay tribute 
to a great American, a dear colleague, 
a good friend, one of our own, 
the late Congressman BOB MATSUI. 

I would like to offer my condolences 
to Doris, to Brian, to Amy, to Anna, 
and to his staff, both in California and 
in Washington, for the wonderful job 
they have done for him and the people 
of his State over the past 26 years. It is 
unique when a colleague of ours dies 
because we are called to look back at 
their accomplishments over the years 
and we begin to realize what a great 
human being they really were. We see 
our colleagues on the floor every day 
and we obviously know them, we like 
them, we have friendships but unfortunately 
not until they leave us do we 
have an opportunity to think back on 
their careers. Looking at BOB’s career, 
it is easy to see that his passing is a 
great loss for America, a great loss to 
his constituents, a great loss to the 
United States Congress. He was and 
will be remembered for his work in the 
House of Representatives, for being a 
leading opponent of Social Security 
privatization, a supporter of free and 
then fair international trade, and a 
fair-minded tax writer who was a 
strong proponent of fiscal responsibility. 
These contributions as a public 
servant over the past decades helped 
move our Nation towards a better and 
brighter future and that will be his 
lasting legacy. BOB MATSUI was held in 
the highest regard by all who knew 
him for his unquestionable honor, his 
keen intelligence and his heartfelt 
kindness. 

All of us in this institution are referred 
to as the gentlelady or gentleman 
from the day we are sworn in as 
a Member of this body. However, BOB 
MATSUI truly deserved that title since 
he was truly the gentleman from California. 


On a different level, BOB was a loving 
husband, father and grandfather. To ascribe 
so many positive qualities to one 
individual might be seen as the usual 
gilding of the lily. In case of BOB MATSUI, 
it was simply the truth. My life, 
this House, and our country are better 


H52 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

off thanks to his life here on Earth 
with us. God bless you, BOB. 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted 
to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), 
who does not realize that among the 
other things that he has to thank BOB 
for is the fact that he will learn now he 
will have to sit next to me on the committee 
and he has been spared that all 
these years. 

(Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission 
to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I look forward 
to that but I must say I loved sitting 
next to BOB MATSUI. 

When I came here Monday morning, 
having heard the news a few hours before, 
here is what I said to myself: This 
place is truly a different place without 
BOB MATSUI. There is for us a large 
hole in our ranks and in our hearts. He 
added so much to this institution that 
he loved. He added his exceptional vitality 
to the notion we often say, this 
is the people’s House. BOB underlined, 
this was the House of all the people. He 
identified with the underdog, with 
those trying to climb up the ladder of 
life more than those who were already 
at the top. Opportunity meant everything 
to BOB. Tax policy, his interest 
in EITC, to help those working lift 
themselves up, his interest in child 
care and health care for those who 
were leaving welfare for work. He 
fought also, we know, for the seniors of 
this Nation. And how hard he was 
fighting as illness overtook them, trying 
to make sure that there was opportunity 
for elder citizens and not deprivation. 


In trade policy, as has been mentioned, 
my brother the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. RANGEL) is here, I think 
I would describe it this way about BOB. 
He saw opportunities in expansion of 
trade, but more and more he came to 
believe that as globalization expanded 
it was critical that expanded trade leveled 
up and not leveled down. Where all 
of his ardor came from, I am not sure. 
Some no doubt from his family’s life 
experience and some of my colleagues 
knew more about that than I did. From 
him, he did not talk very much about 
it. I read in some of the reports that 
BOB was described as low-key and quiet 
and I see some of my colleagues shaking 
their heads. Those press reports did 
not quite capture BOB MATSUI. 

b 1945 
He was gentle, that is true. And he 
was very dignified and in a way quiet. 
But he was a gentle person, focused, 
dedicated, tenacious, and tough. He did 
not claim to know all of the answers; 
but when witnesses came before the 
committee, he was insistent that they 
give straight answers to his questions. 
And the mightier they were, the witness, 
the mightier was BOB MATSUI’s 
determination. I will not mention the 
members of administrations who 
learned that firsthand. 
There has been reference to this 
Christmas card and I wish everybody 

who may be viewing this could see this 
picture, how it moved us. And let me 
close by reading just the last paragraph 
of this card: ‘‘As we look at this 
special season through Anna’s eyes,’’ 
the granddaughter, ‘‘we feel a renewal 
of our family’s traditions. Let us cherish 
these special moments and be 
thankful for what is most important in 
our lives, our family, our friends, and 
the blessings of everyday life. BOB, 
Doris, Brian, Amy, and Anna Matsui.’’ 

Our condolences to the family, to 
Doris, Brian, Amy, and Anna. BOB 
MATSUI was always looking to the future. 
Now it is up to us to look to the 
future on behalf of BOB MATSUI. BOB, 
we love you. 

Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 

It has really been a great honor and 
privilege for me to be able to at least 
control part of the time on our side on 
someone who is one of the most respected 
and most honorable and outstanding 
individuals that I have known 
in my lifetime, my friend BOB MATSUI. 

Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests 
for time, and I yield the balance 
of my time to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. STARK). 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from California for 
yielding me this time, and I yield 21/2 
minutes to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. FARR). 

Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding me this time. 

I remember BOB MATSUI from younger 
days. We were all Sacramentons. I 
was newly married. Shary and I went 
to Sacramento to work in California 
State politics. And there in Sacramento 
was this new enthusiastic political 
community rising because California 
had just amended its constitution 
to set the legislature to hire full-
time staff, and so it was a can-do city. 

And in the midst of this was this 
young graduate from the University of 
California who was a big champion of 
Berkeley and the Cal Bears, and he 
chose to run for city council. And a 
wonderful staff member named Steve 
Thompson introduced BOB to everybody, 
and Steve was a staff member 
and active in Democratic clubs and political 
social life. My wife, Shary, was 
working for John Moss, who was the 
predecessor to BOB MATSUI. He was the 
Congressman at the time; and when 
John Moss retired, the city Democrats 
were split over who to support for that 
seat: the mayor, Phil Isenberg, a great 
popular person in Sacramento; or the 
young BOB MATSUI. And it was a raucous 
grass roots primary battle. BOB 
won, and as they say, the rest is history. 


It is a shock that BOB is gone. He was 
too young, too talented, too much 
going for him as a new grandfather to 
have been taken from us. As Chair of 
the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee, he raised a record 
amount of money for the congressional 
Democrats. We counted on him to lead 
us into battle against the President’s 
proposals to privatize Social Security. 

When one is speaking about BOB, one 
has to talk about Doris, who conquered 
Washington politics in her own right 
and ended up in the Clinton White 
House. She and BOB were a classic political 
couple, really well known in 

D.C. as well as Sacramento. My heart 
goes out to Doris and the family, to 
Brian, Amy, and little Anna. 
BOB’s congressional district is one of 
the most significant in the United 
States because he represents the best 
staffed, most productive, best known 
political celebrities in the Nation’s biggest 
State capital, Sacramento. He was 
the Congressman for the Federal tax 
issues relating to California’s tax 
needs. I remember that BOB MATSUI 
had to carry the tax exemption for 
State legislators’ per diem. Can my 
colleagues imagine the likes of Jess 
Unruh, Willie Brown, Jerry Brown, and 
the entire 120 members of the senate 
and assembly counting on his ability to 
convince Chairman Rostenkowski that 
the California State legislators should 
have something that no Member of 
Congress had, a tax exempt per diem 7 
days a week for the entire legislative 
session? BOB had every legislator in 
California breathing down his throat. 
Their power in Sacramento meant absolutely 
nothing here in Washington. 
They needed BOB to do it for them. No 
one thought he could pull it off, not 
against Rosty. But he did. 

California Democrats had a lot of political 
sorrow this last year. They lost 
the governorship in a recall election, 
lost many seasoned politicians like 
John Burton and Willie Brown and 
John Vasconcellos and Bryon Sher, 
just to name a few notables, to term 
limits. They lost in the unexpected 
death of former State senator Henry 
Mello and even lost their long beloved 
staffer, Steve Thompson. And now Congressman 
BOB MATSUI is lost to us all, 
the biggest loss of all. 

BOB was a Member’s Member. His 
death has sent the State capital into a 
frenzy trying to decide who will run in 
the special election to replace him. 
Congress is abuzz with who will take 
his seat on the Committee on Ways and 
Means. The political world is wondering 
who will succeed him as Chair of 
the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee. 

But the fact of the matter is that no 
one can take his place. The son of Japanese 
immigrants, whom our own government 
interred, he rose to be one of 
our Nation’s most respected Congressman. 
No one will take his place. They 
can only try to emulate what his service 
means to the American spirit of 
public service in a democracy. When 
the Nation is experiencing what most 
people will certainly remember as a 
horrible year in the annals of modern 
history, a year that encompasses war, 
pestilence, and disease, thank God we 
had the goodwill of BOB MATSUI, a real 
American role model. 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, in order to 
accommodate a number of speakers on 
both sides of the aisle, I ask unanimous 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H53 

consent to extend my time for 1 hour 
and that the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. ZOE LOFGREN) control my 
time. 

Pending that, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
ESHOO). 

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
NEUGEBAUER). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentleman from California? 


There was no objection. 

Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
distinguished dean of the California 
Democratic delegation for yielding me 
this time. 

Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight with a 
broken heart. And the way I would like 
to formulate my remarks tonight is 
having a conversation with BOB, because 
it is the best way I know how. I 
would say to him almost every time we 
were on the floor together, BOB, I want 
to tell you something. So, BOB, tonight 
I want to tell you some more things. 

We are broken hearted that you are 
gone and we cannot believe it. We have 
a hole in our hearts, and we have a hole 
in our caucus; and everywhere we have 
turned, we have seen you on the floor 
today. Our joy in being sworn in as new 
Members of Congress has been diminished 
because you are not standing 
here physically next to us. Thank you 
for being the kind of friend that you 
were. Just the best. Loyal, fun, serious, 
aggressive on all the right things. 
Thank you for never being embittered 
by the experience that your family, 
American citizens, third-generation 
Americans, were subjected to by their 
own government. And you grew and 
you rose, and you were an example to 
our country of what one can become 
because of the opportunity of America. 

You understood, BOB, thank you, 
that America is the best idea that was 
ever born. But you went beyond that 
because you reached deep inside of 
yourself and brought out the best in 
everyone, in the ideas that you brought 
here, in the ideas that you fought for. 

Remember how grateful we are to 
you that you carried us in the last 2 
years, that you believed and we were so 
proud that you were a Democrat, and 
you were the kind of Democrat that 
understood that if it was only good for 
the Democratic Party that that was 
not good enough, that we needed to be 
great for our country; and you believed 
that. 

Thank you for believing in Social Security. 
Thank you for the countless 
times that you said we are going to win 
that battle. Thank you for what you 
said to me the last time we were together: 
you know, Anna, that corporations 
by the law of the Congress cannot 
dip into their pension funds and borrow 
from them. Now why would it stand to 
reason that the American government, 
the Congress, the administration continues 
to dip into Social Security? 
That is not the right way to go. 

So all of your dignity, BOB, that magnificent 
face of yours that took on age 
with wisdom, thank you for laughing 

when I said to you how proud I am, 
BOB, that your granddaughter bears 
the name Anna. He really laughed 
when I said that, said, I did not realize 
that you loved me so much. 

BOB, we all loved you. You showed us 
what it is to be a Member of the Congress 
of the United States. In the 
House of the people of all of the people, 
you are always going to be standing 
next to us. What you did here is not 
lost. 

Thank you, Doris, for being the partner 
that you are and always will be. 
Thank you, Brian, for being the son 
that you have been. Thank you, Amy, 
and thank you, Anna. We are going to 
treasure you always. But the most important 
thing is, BOB, we will never 
ever lose what you did here. We are 
going to carry it every day. It is the 
gold and the myrrh of all of us. Thank 
you, BOB. We love you. 

Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. 
SPRATT). 

(Mr. SPRATT asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 


Mr. SPRATT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
with heavy heart to pay tribute to a 
dear friend, an exemplary Member of 
this institution, and a great American. 
BOB MATSUI did more than represent 
the Fifth District of California. He represented 
the best in American politics. 
Indeed, if one asked me to describe an 
ideal Congressman, BOB MATSUI would 
be Exhibit A. In an institution that is 
sometimes short on comity and civility, 
BOB was mellow and civil by nature. 
He had a first-class temperament 
as well as a first-class intelligence. 

b 2000 
But make no mistake about it: he 
was a fighter for what he believed in. 
He was a politician of principle and 
passion and prodigious energy as 
proved by the way he stumped the 
country for Democratic candidates, 
even as he suffered from the blood condition 
that finally claimed his life. 
Whether the issue was taxes or trade or 
Social Security, the earned income 
credit, he always had an arsenal of 
facts at his disposal. On whatever the 
issue, your issue, you were always better 
off if you ran your arguments by 
BOB and sought his support here in the 
well of this House. He became a leader 
in this House and an influence, not so 
much because of seniority or position, 
but because everyone liked him, respected 
him, and knew his intelligence. 
When BOB spoke, he knew his stuff. 
He spoke with authority. He spoke substance 
and sense. I was last with him 
on December 15 for the better part of 
the day. We had a teleconference with 
36 reporters calling in. It lasted for 
more than an hour. We literally had to 
cut it off. Afterwards when I spoke 
with BOB, he was on the ceiling, just 
delighted with the response we had gotten, 
and ready to suit up, ready to do 
battle over Social Security. It was this 

sort of zest that made BOB MATSUI a 
delight and a joy to work with. 

On our side we have a deep bench and 
we will fill his committee position with 
a competent successor, but no one can 
surpass BOB’s mastery of the subjects 
which were his domain on either side of 
the aisle. The Congress has lost a great 
leader and the country a true patriot, a 
citizen, a third generation American 
who was interned as a child with his 
family who suffered an awful, terrible, 
unforgivable injustice. But he loved his 
country nevertheless and committed 
his life to making it better. 

We do not ask today for whom the 
bells toll. They toll for all of us, but especially 
for those of us who served with 
BOB MATSUI, loved him as a friend, and 
wonder if we will ever see his like 
again. To Doris and to Brian and Amy 
and little Anna, our hearts go out. But 
just as BOB lives on in all of you, he 
lives on in all of us who worked with 
him for years and years. His legacy is 
one that will last in this institution. 
Indeed, this great old institution of the 
Republic is a better place because he 
served here sacrificially for 26 years. 

Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS). 

Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise and speak in honor 
of a wonderful colleague and a beloved 
friend, BOB MATSUI. No one, but no one, 
was more able and more respected in 
this body than BOB MATSUI. I came 
here a little over 18 years ago, and I 
met this man who was so thoughtful, 
kind, and gentle. Sometimes in this 
body we call each other ‘‘the honorable, 
the gentleman, the gentlewoman.’’ 
BOB MATSUI was honorable, 
and he was a gentleman. He was honorable 
in the truest sense of that word. 

I remember when I first came here in 
the fall of 1986. During freshman orientation, 
we had a dinner at Statuary 
Hall. My 10-year-old son, John Miles, 
came with me; and BOB MATSUI took 
the time to engage my son in conversation. 
My young son, only 10 years old, 
really appreciated that. BOB MATSUI 
took the time to talk to him and almost 
treated him like another member 
of the freshman class. He grew to admire 
and like BOB MATSUI. When I informed 
him that BOB MATSUI had 
passed, he said, ‘‘Daddy, I really liked 
him. I am sorry. I am so sorry.’’ 

We lost a colleague, and some of us 
have lost a friend. The American people 
have lost a champion and a warrior 
who fought to protect Social Security 
and looked out for the young and all of 
those who have been left out and left 
behind in America. 

There are people in this business that 
we meet from time to time who love 
the world, but they do not necessarily 
like people. BOB MATSUI not only liked 
people, but he loved. He loved all of us, 
and we loved him. 

A few short years ago, I had the opportunity 
to spend a weekend in BOB’s 
district. He took me to a university 
where we had a community meeting 


H54 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

with students and faculty. We listened, 
we spoke, and we listened. As a matter 
of fact, on the campus when we arrived, 
there were chickens running all 
around. I said, BOB, I feel really at 
home with all of these chickens. So 
when I got up to speak, I said to the 
president of the university, I said, Mr. 
President, I know there is some controversy 
about chickens on the campus, 
but do not move the chickens; let 
the chickens stay here. And BOB 
laughed and laughed, and we got an 
agreement out of the president that 
the chickens would remain on the campus. 


We visited schools, we visited a synagogue, 
a church, and a service in memory 
of Dr. King. During that trip, I witnessed 
the love that BOB MATSUI had 
for his people and the love that they 
demonstrated for him. 

I tell my colleagues, it seems so 
unreal, so unbelievable; it is almost 
impossible to comprehend the loss of a 
friend, the loss of a brother, a colleague, 
a husband, a father, a grandfather. 
What more can be said about 
this man? His life was not in vain. He 
gave of himself. He was just a warm, 
decent, good human being who treated 
each and every one of us with respect. 

When I was walking across the 
grounds of the Capitol today a few 
hours ago, a police officer came up to 
me and said, ‘‘Congressman, when you 
speak to Mrs. Matsui, please tell her on 
behalf of all of the Capitol Police officers 
that her husband was a good man 
and he treated us well.’’ 

As a Nation and as a people, this is a 
great loss. BOB MATSUI represents 
something very special. I, for one, I do 
not believe that we will ever be so 
lucky or so blessed to witness his likeness 
again. May God bless his soul. 

At this very difficult time, our prayers 
and our thoughts are with his beloved 
wife, Doris; his son, Brian; his 
daughter-in-law, Amy; his granddaughter, 
Anna; his staff; and the people 
of the Fifth Congressional District 
of California. May they find comfort 
and peace in the love and memory of 
this great and beloved man. 

Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to our fellow 
Californian and BOB’s colleague on the 
Committee on Ways and Means (Mr. 
BECERRA). 

Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague and friend for yielding 
me this time. 

To Doris Matsui, Brian, Amy and 
Anna, we grieve with you; but more, we 
celebrate the life of a wonderful human 
being, as I know you will have an opportunity 
to do over the coming 
months and years as we all remember 
BOB MATSUI. 

I would like to talk to you, Anna, because 
right now it is perhaps difficult 
for you to grasp all that is being said 
about your grandfather, given that you 
are just a little over a year old. But in 
time, with the wonders of technology 
and the beauty of a democracy in the 
people’s House where every word that 

we speak in the well of this body is recorded 
for time immortal, perhaps you 
will have an opportunity to take a 
glimpse at what so many people 
thought of your grandfather. 

I will tell you he was a wonderful 
human being, a superb legislator and 
public servant and, perhaps most of all, 
a great American. I will tell you also 
that he graduated from a great high 
school 17 years before I did, at C.K. 
McClatchy High School in Sacramento, 
California. 

He cared a great deal about the people 
he represented. He was a fighter 
and a champion. He knew when to 
fight, he knew how to fight, and he 
knew for whom he was fighting all the 
time. 

If you ever had an opportunity to 
converse with BOB MATSUI, you knew 
that his deepest conversations were 
spoken with his eyes. He had these eyes 
that somehow could convey what oftentimes 
words cannot, and you knew 
that when he spoke with his eyes he 
was speaking to you from conviction, 
with determination, focus, and experience. 
And if it were not his words, for 
sure his eyes would convince you of a 
direction to take, of what he was trying 
to say, of where to go, of how to do 
it right. A handshake from BOB MATSUI 
was as sure a bet as the sun rising in 
the morning. 

If you knew BOB MATSUI, you knew 
that he cared deeply about family, 
about this country, and about what 
would happen to the next generation. 
We are going to miss him in this fight 
to create a better America, to preserve 
Social Security for our seniors and for 
the next generations to come. We are 
going to miss him when we talk about 
our relations with all of our friends 
around the world in trade. But we will 
carry on that fight, because he is a 
champion to us now as he was before he 
passed on. 

Anna, I say to you as you grow and 
have an opportunity to speak to your 
grandmother and your parents more 
about your grandfather, and as you 
read more about his many accomplishments, 
I hope that you will look back 
at some of the words that were spoken 
by people who respected him so dearly 
and considered him friend, mentor, 
confidant, that this is a man who left 
so much for you to glean, to learn 
from, and this is a man from whom you 
will have an opportunity to say we can 
admire an American and certainly 
America can say that we can appreciate 
this American. 

So, Doris, with all due respect to you 
and to Brian and to Amy, I think it is 
most appropriate for me to address myself 
to Anna because I believe the 
greatest gift that BOB MATSUI left us 
was the fact that he thought about the 
future; and, Anna, I suspect that he 
was thinking about you as much as 
anyone else. So with you Anna, Godspeed 
as you learn from a great man, 
BOB MATSUI. 

Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. MOORE). 

Mr. MOORE of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, 
I am here tonight to pay tribute and 
honor to our good friend and fallen 
comrade, BOB MATSUI. My wife, Stephanie, 
and I just came from visiting 
with Doris at their home, and we put 
our arms around Doris and told her 
how much we loved her and loved BOB 
MATSUI. 

I cannot think of a more fitting tribute 
to pay to BOB MATSUI than to say 
this: I have never heard BOB MATSUI 
say anything unkind about any other 
human being, and I have never heard 
any person in this Chamber say anything 
unkind about BOB MATSUI. And 
that is somewhat unique, I suppose, because 
there are some unkind things 
said about other people in this Chamber, 
but never about BOB or from BOB. 

I feel that we are going to miss BOB. 
I know we will miss BOB, and we will 
miss his intellect, his passion, his compassion, 
and the history that he 
brought to this body. I know Congress 
will miss BOB. I know that I am a better 
person for having known BOB. And 
when God looks down on some cold, 
wintry night on this beautiful Earth 
and there are 1 million stars shining in 
the sky, I know one of those stars will 
shine brighter, and that will be BOB. 
We will miss you, BOB, and we love 
you. 

Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. 
PRICE). 

(Mr. PRICE of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 

Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, this is a House of diverse and 
talented Members, but among these 
Members, BOB MATSUI stood out in 
many, many ways. He stood out as an 
effective legislator; a senior member of 
the Committee on Ways and Means, the 
third ranking Democrat. BOB was a 
leader on trade issues. He was a prominent 
spokesman among Democrats for 
those of us who favor an expansive 
trade policy for our country, with safeguards, 
to level the playing field in 
terms of environmental and labor 
standards. He was the foremost Democratic 
expert on Social Security, determined 
to fortify that program for future 
generations. 

BOB MATSUI stood out as a committed 
leader of the Democratic Caucus. 
He did an extraordinary job in 
what is our party’s toughest assignment, 
that is, the chairmanship of the 
Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee, recruiting our candidates, 
raising untold amounts of money, 
keeping us motivated and focused. 

b 2015 
He had the toughest assignment in 
our caucus, and he did it with grace 
and with great effectiveness. 
BOB MATSUI stood out for his extraordinary 
and distinctive personal story. 
As a child he was one of 120,000 Japanese 
Americans interned in camps during 
World War II. I learned about BOB’s 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H55 

story early in my service in Congress 
as he helped many of us understand the 
need for the Japanese American Redress 
Act, belatedly passed by this 
Chamber in 1988. 

BOB MATSUI stood out as a warm 
friend and supportive colleague. He was 
a man who took time to get to know 
his colleagues. He was a wonderful listener, 
a great encourager, always willing 
to share credit and to seek a common 
basis for action. 

BOB was one of our most reasonable 
Members. Surely he was one of our 
most reasonable colleagues. He was 
persuasive precisely because we knew 
he was a man of his word, and we knew 
he was a man of utter integrity. 

Like many here, I considered BOB a 
close friend, generous with his counsel, 
with ready encouragement and will 
miss him greatly. 

My wife and I have also treasured our 
friendship with BOB and Doris Matsui 
as a couple. Doris has made major contributions 
of her own to our country, 
particularly as a Deputy Assistant to 
the President and Deputy Director of 
Public Liaison in the White House for 
the Clinton administration, and she 
has been a strong and loyal partner to 
BOB in his endeavors. 

We extend our heartfelt sympathy to 
Doris and her family, hoping that she 
may draw comfort and strength from 
the outpouring of affection and respect 
from BOB’s and her many friends and 
admirers this evening and in the days 
to come. 

Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON-
LEE). 

(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked 
and was given permission to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, I say to Doris, she married a 
nice man. 

The Congressman that we mourn tonight 
can be described in many, many 
ways. It is not often that we use the 
word ‘‘nice’’ and people understand the 
fullness of what it means. BOB MATSUI 
was a nice person and a nice man. He 
was a committed man and a dedicated 
public servant. 

I enjoyed talking to him because we 
had a commonality. He started on the 
Sacramento City Council, and he made 
me feel that, coming from the city 
council in my town. 

He loved Sacramento. He rose to be 
the vice mayor of that town, but it 
made him sensitive to the local needs 
of people. So, even though I would view 
him to be the crafter, the definer of the 
modern day Social Security in these 
days, I know that he also understood 
when a pothole got your last tire, that 
made him a man who cared about the 
little things but understood the big 
things. 

I note his love and affection for the 
Committee on Ways and Means. Yes, if 
one can love a committee, BOB loved 
his committee. He loved his fellow 
committee persons. He loved his rank


ing member, who he called chairman. 
They had a special bond and a special 
unity, cared about each other, and of 
course BOB was not a narrow thinker. 
One may have come from Texas, may 
have come from New York, Missouri or 
somewhere else, but he embraced you. 

I will never forget his steady hand in 
this last very challenging election 
cycle. If you did not toe the line, BOB 
had a way of giving you a call and 
making sure that what you needed to 
do to get good folk elected were elected. 
He stayed steadfast in the last days 
of the Louisiana election, but most of 
all his special story is worth noting, 
and to his wife Doris, his son Brian, 
daughter-in-law Amy and granddaughter 
Anna, he will go down as an 
icon of American history. 

I cannot imagine an internment. I 
have a history that relates to that, but 
I never was a slave, but yes, this humble 
Congressperson started his early 
life interned in the United States of 
America. His story is unfortunately 
part of America’s story, but even with 
that experience this giant of a man 
rose to be a leader in this Congress and 
to be able to turn us away from those 
ways that were wrong. 

Thank you, BOB, Congressman MATSUI, 
for living amongst us. Thank you 
for being a man of honor. Thank you, 
Doris, Brian, Amy and Anna, for giving 
him to us. God bless you and may your 
soul rest in peace. 

I rise today to honor a fallen colleague, one 
who embodied everything a true public official 
is supposed to be. But ROBERT T. MATSUI was 
more than a Member of Congress, he was a 
husband, a father and a grandfather, but more 
than that he was a man of great character. His 
presence in this hallowed chamber for the last 
26 years will not soon be forgotten, but his 
presence in our hearts will live on even longer. 

ROBERT MATSUI was a dedicated public 
servant who had a long and illustrious career 
in California and here in Washington. He rose 
to great national prominence, but ROBERT 
MATSUI always had his heart and his values in 
his district in Sacramento. His dedication to 
local issues was shown by his years of service 
in the Sacramento City Council where he rose 
to the position of Vice Mayor of Sacramento. 
Throughout his tenure in Congress, ROBERT 
MATSUI never forgot the constituents who 
voted fourteen times to send him back to 
Washington. He championed the fight for adequate 
flood control in the region and was integral 
in Sacramento’s transformation. He had 
big ideas for our Nation, but he never forgot 
the value of individuals and the importance of 
taking care of your district. All those who had 
the honor of knowing him could see he was a 
genuine person with real values. 

The thing I will always remember ROBERT 
MATSUI for was that his voice was gentle, but 
you knew that his spirit was strong In Congress 
he was a tireless advocate and national 
spokesman for the preservation of Social Security. 
When he first campaigned in 1978 for 
the congressional seat serving Sacramento, 
California, he persuaded voters to elect him by 
promising that he would bring to the office ‘‘a 
new form of statesmanship,’’ anyone who 
knew him know that he brought statesmanship 
to a new level. His excellence and grace was 

known on both sides of the aisle. His presence 
will sorely be missed,but his heart and 
determination will stay with us all. 

At this time of grief it is hard to understand 
why a good man passed away in the prime of 
his life. But I hope his wife Doris, son Brian, 
daughter-in-law Amy, and granddaughter Anna 
will take solace in the fact that ROBERT MATSUI 
lived a full life of honor. There may be those 
who will live longer, but there will be few who 
lay claim to that same statement. We are all 
at a loss for a great leader in this body, but 
we suffer a greater loss of a good human 
being. 

Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. 
LOWEY). 

Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with great sorrow to join my colleagues 
in remembering and honoring 
our colleague, our dear friend, BOB 
MATSUI. 

BOB MATSUI was a fine man. He loved 
his family, he loved his country and he 
loved this House, the institution he 
served for 26 years, and in return, we 
loved him. 

He loved his family. He loved his 
country. We loved his gentle manner 
and incisive mind. We loved his tenacity 
and fair-mindedness, his policy expertise 
and political skill. He was a 
true leader of this caucus and the California 
delegation, a real hero to Japanese 
Americans and a true fighter for 
economic opportunity, fiscal accountability 
and social justice. Like so 
many, I cannot imagine debating the 
future of Social Security and many 
other issues without BOB. 

While the Nation will suffer from his 
loss, the family’s loss is deeper and 
greater than we could possibly imagine. 
My heart goes out to Doris, Brian, 
Amy and little Anna. He was so proud 
of Anna and was so happy to share pictures 
of her with all of us, and Doris, 
you were truly his partner, and he 
spoke so often of Brian and Amy and 
their joy at Anna’s birth. I know he 
loved them and he was so proud of 
them. 

I also want to extend my condolences 
to his wonderful, hardworking staff, 
both here on the Hill and at the DCCC, 
his close circle of former staff, as well 
as to the people of the Fifth District of 
California. BOB was a kind, principled 
man, a valued colleague and a very 
dear friend. I will miss him greatly. 

We love you, BOB. You will always remain 
in our hearts and your outstanding 
work will always be an example 
to this House of Representatives. 

Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. GEORGE 
MILLER), our colleague. 

Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. 
Mr. Speaker, in my 30 years in the Congress 
you have the honor and the privilege 
of meeting so many people from so 
many different walks of life, not just 
my colleagues that I have served with 
in the House of Representatives but obviously 
the people that I represent and 
the people who come to the Nation’s 


H56 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

capital to seek our help in so many endeavors 
that they are engaged in their 
families and their livelihoods, but 
there are a few who are very special. 
They stand out in our professional life. 
They stand out as our peers and our 
colleagues. 

BOB MATSUI was a very special person, 
for all of the reasons that my colleagues 
have said here tonight. We all 
know that at his core was the gold 
standard in conviction, in morality and 
integrity and in giving us the unvarnished 
truth from time to time when 
we did not agree with him. 

I think that is one of the reasons we 
were so fond of him. When you had a 
disagreement with him, he sought you 
out and he wanted to discuss it with 
you, face-to-face, person-to-person, colleague-
to-colleague, trying to work out 
the difficulties to make this a better 
country, but when you discussed it 
with him, you understood that he was 
clinging to principle, and he was 
clinging to integrity because it was the 
core of his existence. 

Many have referred to the fact of this 
family’s experience in the internment 
camp, and I do not think there is any 
question but that gave him a compass 
to set a course on the issues of social 
justice and opportunity in this society 
and civil rights. It is unparalleled, I 
think. 

We all work in these fields, and we 
have some outstanding individuals in 
this Congress that I have served with 
over 30 years who have fought these 
fights. BOB was one of those. 

I had the opportunity to work with 
him on the reparations bill and in the 
Manzanar Historic Monument bill of 
one of the internment camps so that 
this country could remember what happened 
in the Tule Lake and the other 
internment centers. 

I do not know what else to say except 
that this is the loss of a really, really 
special person who was a wonderful 
friend, who was a great, great credit to 
this institution and who leaves behind 
a magnificent legacy along with a magnificent 
family, a family that no 
spouse or father could have been more 
proud of than he was of Doris and Brian 
and daughter-in-law Amy and this new 
granddaughter Anna. 

To see him and Doris at public 
events, engaged in their community 
and the partnership that they had and 
their conferring back and forth on the 
issues and the battles that he was engaged 
in, was a wonderful experience. I 
am going to miss him greatly. I think 
this country is going to miss him even 
more. 

Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LEWIS), 
our wonderful colleague. 

Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman very 
much for the time. 

I very much apologize being as late 
as I am. I meant to be here earlier, but 
I am glad I walked in as my colleague 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 

GEORGE MILLER) was making his remarks, 
for the emotion that we could 
feel in his very presence and voice is a 
reflection of how all of us feel, and I 
join in this celebration of our friend 
BOB MATSUI. 

All of us who care about public affairs 
and the Congress absolutely know 
that fundamental to our success in 
solving people’s problems involves our 
understanding of just how important 
people are to our entire process. 

The gentleman from California (Mr. 
GEORGE MILLER) and I got to know 
each other first in Sacramento, and at 
that very time, overlapping our service, 
our friend BOB MATSUI was serving 
on the city council. I learned to get to 
know BOB in a different venue, however, 
for he and I were elected in 1978 
and came here as freshman, not so long 
ago. 

BOB MATSUI, as you have heard from 
many a person, is a fabulous, fabulous 
reflection of the best of public affairs. 

I would like my colleagues to know 
that while we all believe public policy 
is what we should really be about, 
looking for the solutions to problems 
that the people care about, looking for 
alternative avenues for making a difference, 
when it comes to it in the final 
analysis we are all in this together. 

b 2030 
The American public has grown tired 
of that rhetoric that we hear all too 
often that reflects the fringe of our dialogue; 
and far from that fringe but 
rather right in the heart of the best of 
us was a personality we have been discussing 
today, ROBERT MATSUI of Sacramento, 
of the Committee on Ways 
and Means, a wonderful, wonderful 
human being, who was willing to look 
you in the eye, tell you what he 
thought when he disagreed with you. 
All too often, and much more, he was 
putting his arm around you and telling 
you what you did well and what he 
thought of you on the positive side. 
If we could take the extreme from 
our rhetoric and the dialogue around 
here and remember BOB MATSUI suddenly 
because of that, this House, great 
as it is, would indeed be an even better 
place. 
I am pleased to take just a moment 
to express to Doris, their family, all 
their friends in Sacramento, how much 
we will miss them and how much we 
pain for especially his personal family. 
Our own friends in Sacramento who remain 
have talked often about the 
greatness of this man. We only had a 
chance by getting to know that by having 
the privilege of serving with him 
here. 
With that, let me bid BOB adieu and 
join with all of his dear friends here in 
expressing our love and prayers for not 
just his family, but the future, the future 
of those he served, and know that 
we will all miss his service. 
Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
We have heard tonight so many of 
our colleagues speak of BOB and de


scribe BOB in so many different ways. 
He was a great American. We are in 
mourning in this House. His constituents 
are in mourning. California is in 
mourning, and the Nation has lost a 
giant. 

BOB was a giant through and 
through. He grew up in Sacramento out 
in the valley, went to Cal Berkeley, 
went to law school at Hastings College 
of Law. He was the first Asian American 
to hold a leadership position in 
the House of Representatives. When I 
became the chairperson of the California 
Democratic Delegation in the 
108th Congress, and he had always been 
a mentor to me, he upped his 
mentorship of me at that time. It is 
something I have always been immensely 
grateful for. 

We have talked about his leadership 
on a variety of issues: Social Security, 
the reparations bills, and health care 
for children. The list goes on and on. 
But we are mourning him today as 
someone we knew also as a friend. 

Some in the papers have said he was 
mild-mannered, and my thought was 
that the BOB I knew was tough as nails 
and focused. Yes, he was mild-mannered. 
He was polite is what he was, 
but he never lost focus on what he was 
for. He loved his parents because they 
gave him a framework to understand 
the world. And it is important to understand 
that a great injustice was 
done to his family and to him, but he 
was never bitter about that because it 
allowed him to appreciate also the gift 
he was given, as so many of us were, of 
opportunity here in America. 

I believe that is really what fueled 
his passion here for the issues he 
fought for, the opportunity that others 
should have that was given to him. It 
was not just limited to his constituents, 
whom he loved dearly, but was for 
all Americans. 

I can recall several years ago a situation 
in Silicon Valley. He was very interested 
in technology. Entrepreneurs 
had been hit with a weird tax and had 
lost everything in the AMT-ISO disaster. 
These were Silicon Valley people, 
but BOB came from Sacramento 
and sat all day in San Jose to listen to 
their stories because he cared about 
them, whether they were his constituents 
or not. 

BOB was one of our most compassionate 
Members, one of our most focused 
Members, but I also want to talk 
about BOB the family person. I do not 
think there was ever a son as brilliant 
as Brian, if you listened to BOB. Nor 
was there a daughter-in-law as wonderful 
as Amy; and never a grandchild as 
creative and adorable as Anna; not to 
mention his wonderful spouse, Doris. 
Many of us have spouses. We love our 
spouses, but Doris had almost a unique 
relationship among spouses in the 
House because not only was she BOB’s 
life partner, she was BOB’s partner in 
political life and in policy life. She 
stood up for the people of the Fifth District 
of California every bit as much as 
BOB MATSUI stood up for those people. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H57 

We thank Doris for her many, many 
years of service with BOB for those constituents 
and for Americans. 

Just a final word. BOB had said he 
was having a few health problems. I 
had no idea how serious they were; but 
certainly BOB MATSUI knew how serious 
they were. Even though BOB knew 
he was ill, he kept working for us. He 
was chair of the DCCC, not because he 
was on an ego trip. In fact, he did not 
want the job; we made him do it. He 
fought those fights because he believed 
that the ideals of the Democratic 
Party for Social Security, for a safety 
net, for education, for opportunity for 
hard-working people who play by the 
rules to get ahead, those were values 
that were core to him. And even 
though he put his own health at risk, 
he fought on for us. 

I want to thank Doris for allowing 
him to do that. It is a sacrifice that is 
immense. We all feel the loss today. I 
thank Doris; his wonderful son, Brian; 
Amy; his granddaughter, Anna. I think 
back on the many times we spent in 
California enjoying ourselves. He was a 
Cal graduate, but it did not stop him 
from being a Stanford fan as well, 
which I always appreciated. 

I loved BOB MATSUI, as did the entire 
delegation. We miss him a great deal. 
Other people will follow his steps, but 
no one will be able to fill them completely 
in our hearts. 

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PELOSI). 

Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chair of our California Democratic 
Delegation for her wonderful words 
about BOB MATSUI. 

Anyone who did not know BOB MATSUI 
and just turned on the television 
tonight would have to be impressed by 
the array of comments from so many 
different Members of Congress on both 
sides of the aisle about this exceptional 
person. There is no way to exaggerate 
how wonderful he was. He was a person 
of great intellect and great passion. He 
was a person of great gentility and of 
great strength when it came to debating 
his points. 

Ever since Members and colleagues 
and staff on the Hill and reporters and 
the media learned of his death, they 
have come and said, BOB MATSUI would 
go out of his way to come by and say 
hello. He always smiled, he always 
asked about people’s well-being and 
how they were doing and could he be 
helpful. He was a gentle man. But 
again, he had a strength about him 
that if he thought on a matter of public 
policy someone was abandoning the 
children of America or the seniors of 
America or America’s working families, 
he made it quite clear to them 
that in his eyes he was losing respect 
for them because he thought that is 
what we came here to do. 

So many Members have talked about 
his talent, his personality, his love of 
family which was preeminent because 
at the end of the day that is, of course, 
what matters most. I visited Doris 

Matsui on Sunday evening to extend 
the condolences of BOB’s colleagues to 
her, and to say how magnificently received 
BOB was after the election; that 
even though we did not win, every time 
his name was mentioned or he was introduced, 
he would receive a standing 
ovation from the members of the 
Democratic Caucus because he dealt 
with them honestly. He worked so hard 
and so smartly for our success, it just 
was not to be; but they appreciated the 
leadership he provided. 

Just to talk about a few things, we 
had the occasion the last night that we 
were here, December 8, to have a dinner 
in appreciation of those who helped 
us in our efforts. We surprised BOB because 
it was turned on him, and we expressed 
our appreciation to him. The 
gentleman from New York (Mr. RANGEL), 
the ranking member, was so eloquent 
and spoke from the heart about 
BOB MATSUI. It really was stunning to 
BOB. It was a gift that God gave us that 
we would have that opportunity to express 
appreciation to him. This is a 
very, very modest man and all of that 
attention was stunning to him. 

So when I said to Doris, remember 
the dinner and it was so wonderful, she 
said he talked about it so much and he 
talked about the toast of the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. RANGEL) 
and how the Members expressed their 
appreciation and how surprised he was 
and how much it meant to him. 

So to my Democratic colleagues, 
thank you for the generosity that you 
extended to BOB MATSUI. I hope it is a 
comfort to those of us who loved him 
and all of us in our caucus that we did 
have an opportunity to say thank you 
to him in a very special way. It was 
quite remarkable. I think all of my colleagues 
will agree that my colleagues 
were clamoring for BOB to be reappointed 
to the DCCC. Indeed, he had 
that opportunity, and he was willing to 
serve, except God had other plans. 

It is important to note that in the 
summer of this year one of BOB’s very 
closest friends, Steve Thompson, exactly 
BOB’s age, was diagnosed just a 
few weeks before he died, and it was a 
complete and total surprise. He, like 
BOB, was a very respected member in 
the Sacramento, California, community. 
They were very dear friends since 
seventh grade. When BOB came to his 
new school, not a very athletic appearance 
anyway, Steve was a big man on 
campus and he said he just wrapped his 
arm around BOB MATSUI and that made 
it okay for everybody, and they were 
friends for life. 

Nobody would have ever expected 6 
months ago that death would mean 
this summer for Steve and now for BOB. 
In any case, Steve’s death took a lot 
out of BOB. He seemed so saddened by 
it, as we are saddened by his passing. 
In any event, Doris told us that BOB 
left us peacefully, just the way he 
lived, surrounded by people who loved 
him. Again, Anna saying Da-da. He 
took her to his office on December 23, 
had their pictures taken in front of the 

Capitol. Well, when you have been here 
26 years, a picture in front of the Capitol 
is a picture at your desk because 
he had a special office. It was his plan, 
and he was bragging about it that he 
was going to take Anna to be here 
today with him because she was born 
since the last swearing-in. Again that 
was not to be. 

In any event, when Anna is old 
enough to read about her grandfather, 
she will know he was one of the most 
dedicated public servants in our country. 
He was a true patriot, he was a decent 
man, he loved his family, and he 
was a best friend to almost everybody 
in the Congress of the United States. 

There is so much to say, but everybody 
knows that our thoughts and 
prayers are with Doris, Brian, Amy and 
Anna who shared BOBBY with us and inspired 
his commitment for a brighter 
future for America. 

Imagine that his family and he as a 
small child were in a Japanese internment 
camp. Again, as the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. ZOE LOFGREN) 
said, it only heightened his love for 
America because he knew that we 
could do better and he would be a part 
of that. I will close by saying that one 
of the pleasures we had at this dinner 
on December 8, as the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. LEWIS) reminds me, I always 
said during the campaign that 
BOB MATSUI was a maestro, that he was 
orchestrating all of this activity all 
over the country. This man who unbeknownst 
to us had this diagnosis, and 
it was not supposed to be fatal, but the 
pneumonia was. 

b 2045 
In any event, he would be working so 
hard for senior citizens all day on a Social 
Security issue and orchestrating 
hundreds, thousands of young people 
throughout the country to be involved 
in campaigns to make the future better. 
He had a way of channeling the enthusiasm 
that he had for issues into 
the activism that was necessary to 
make a difference. 
At this party we gave him a baton 
recognizing the maestro that he was 
and is. We will just miss him terribly. 
The poet Longfellow wrote: 
‘‘Were a star quenched on high, 
For ages would its light, 
Still traveling downward from the sky, 
Shine on our mortal sight. 
So when a great man dies, 
For years beyond our ken, 
The life he leaves behind him lies 
Upon the paths of men.’’ 
BOB MATSUI’s light will always shine, 
one that will guide us to a better 
America, and that was his dream. 
Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
I would like to conclude by thanking 
all of those who have participated this 
evening as well as some of our colleagues 
who were unable to actually 
physically be here but who have prepared 
their statements for our colleague, 
a giant of the legislature, a 
man who warmed our hearts, who 


H58 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

broke our hearts when he died, someone 
who was never petty, always modest 
but always a leader, always someone 
who could make America proud. 

Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
add my remarks to the glowing ones we have 
heard regarding the untimely passing of our 
dear colleague, BOB MATSUI. To have known 
BOB MATSUI is to be heartbroken by his death. 
I believe that our Republican colleagues would 
agree. Especially for Democrats, however, the 
loss is profoundly felt three times over. First, 
there was the man whose human dimensions 
of kindness, consideration, and friendly persuasion 
made him instantly likeable and one 
of the most admired and respected members 
across the political spectrum. Second, there 
was the successful party leader, who had just 
completed his term as a hugely successful 
chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee. And third, there was the 
Democratic seer of social security whom we 
were depending upon to lead us through the 
coming crucial social security debate, one of 
the several subjects whose byzantine complexities 
BOB had mastered as third ranking on 
the Ways and Means Committee. Congress 
and the country could not afford to lose even 
one of these three BOB MATSUIs. Now, sadly 
we have lost all three. As we mourn the loss 
of one of the country’s most effective public 
servants, we celebrate our good fortune that 
BOB MATSUI gave his life to public service. 

Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
extend my condolences to the family of BOB 
MATSUI. BOB was my friend for 13 years. Even 
though we sat on opposite sides of the aisle 
we shared a bond as fellow Californians, and 
he always had my utmost respect. 

In this House BOB always strove to do the 
best for his district, his State, and his country. 
He entered Congress with a distinguished 
class in 1978 and made a lasting impression. 
His 26 years here were an example of how a 
man can be an effective promoter of his party 
and the consummate gentleman at the same 
time. Even in the most partisan of positions, 
chairman of his party’s Congressional Campaign 
Committee, BOB took the high road and 
set an example for us to follow. He was a man 
of unparalleled integrity, compassion, intelligence 
and dedication. 

I will miss BOB MATSUI. I know that the people 
of California, the United States, and the 
Members of this body share my sentiments. 

Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in profound 
sadness to express my deepest sympathy 
to the family and friends of the Honorable 
ROBERT MATSUI. I was shocked to learn 
of the untimely death of our colleague and 
friend BOB, with whom I was so fortunate to 
serve for 24 years. 

BOB was truly a great man who triumphed 
over adversity to help lead our Nation. During 
World War II the United States wrongfully interned 
120,000 American citizens and permanent 
resident aliens of Japanese ancestry. 
From his earliest days, BOB faced this brutal 
devastation as he and his family were rounded 
up, torn from their home and sent to the desolation 
of a detention camp in Tule Lake, CA. 

Tempered by tragedy, BOB walked from the 
darkness of that detention to lead the fight for 
passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. 
That historic legislation acknowledged the fundamental 
injustice of the internment, apologized 
on behalf of the people of the United 
States and made restitution to those interned. 

He called upon us to serve a high purpose 
and reminded us that while we addressed the 
injustice done, we were also protecting fundamental 
American values enshrined in our Constitution. 


This remarkable accomplishment gave 
added weight to United States human rights 
policy and credibility to our statements about 
other countries’ human rights violations. While 
no amount of apology or restitution fully 
rectifies the denial of human rights, BOB understood 
that the acknowledgment of this past 
injustice was an important step forward. BOB 
and I shared that commitment to improve civil 
rights and human rights all over the world. 

BOB MATSUI’s long involvement in public 
service resulted in an impressive record of 
success in Sacramento and Washington. 
Among other achievements he was a legislative 
leader on Social Security as a member of 
the House Ways and Means Committee. He 
rallied House Democrats with integrity and 
spirit as Chairman of the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee. 

We mourn the loss of a good and decent 
man, a leader with such virtue, a fellow Californian, 
and a friend. We will carry a heavier 
burden without his strength to depend upon. 
My wife Annette and I extend our wishes of 
solace and peace for his wife Doris, his son 
Brian, his daughter-in-law Amy and his granddaughter 
Anna during this most difficult time. 

Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
remember a dedicated public servant and 
great friend, ROBERT T. MATSUI. 

It was a privilege and honor serving with 
BOB. Although we only served together for one 
term, I learned a great deal from BOB—starting 
when I worked at the other end of Pennsylvania 
Avenue—about protecting Social Security, 
expanding free trade, welfare reform, 
and giving American families more opportunities 
to prosper. 

His selfless determination, borne from his 
early childhood experiences—resulted in a lifelong 
commitment to heal our Nation’s wounds 
and make amends for past wrongs. 

Answering President John F. Kennedy’s 
call, BOB inspired generations of Americans 
who dedicated themselves to public service, 
including minorities and the Asian-American 
community in particular. 

His leadership in this Chamber resulted in a 
formal apology for the treatment of Japanese-
Americans interned and discriminated against 
during World War II. 

BOB never shied away from difficult debates. 
While seeking innovative ways to help America’s 
employees stay competitive in the global 
economy, he championed President Clinton’s 
North American Fair Trade Agreement and secured 
a strong, bipartisan vote in the House 
for permanent free trade relations with China. 

His efforts helped fuel the largest economic 
expansion in our Nation’s history, and opened 
new lines of communication and cultural understanding 
around the world. 

We will miss BOB’s strong and uncompromising 
leadership on Social Security, a void in 
this Chamber that will be very difficult to fill. 

Mr. Speaker, ROBERT MATSUI was a man I 
was proud to call my friend. May God bless 
his wife Doris and the Matsui family in this difficult 
hour as we honor the memory of a man 
truly loved and respected by his peers and his 
country, and whose contributions will always 
be remembered in this Chamber. 

Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to join my colleagues in expressing profound 

sorrow on the loss of one of this House’s most 
highly respected and widely regarded members, 
the Honorable BOB MATSUI of Sacramento. 


With his passing, we have lost a national 
conscience in Congress. Although I had the 
privilege to serve with him for only 2 of his 26 
years of distinguished service in the House, it 
did not take long for me to realize after arriving 
here as a freshman, that he was truly a 
man of distinction. His leadership in many 
ways was subtle, but firm and strong. 

I had the honor of serving with him on the 
Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, 
and recognize today, along with many 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, his 
long-standing commitment and contributions to 
the progress of our communities. It was 
through his diligence, as many have recounted 
and memorialized this evening, that healing 
and justice was brought through the enactment 
of Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which authorized 
reparations and a formal apology to 
surviving Japanese Americans who had been 
detained in U.S. concentration camps during 
World War II. This is just but one of the lasting 
landmark accomplishments of his leadership. 

On so many other accounts and in so many 
other ways, he was there for those in need of 
a voice in Congress. A reliable and true public 
servant, for the disadvantaged, for our seniors, 
and for our young Americans, who he inspired 
with his example and character. 

BOB MATSUI was gifted leader who epitomized 
the noblest qualities of public service. 
On behalf of the people of Guam, I extend our 
deepest sympathies to his wife, Doris and 
their family and to the people of the fifth District 
of California. 

Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, when I 
opened my holiday cards this season, one in 
particular stood out. It was bigger than the 
others. It was more colorful. It had several pictures 
instead of just one. It was from the Matsui 
family, and just about every picture included 
young Anna Matsui, BOB’s only grandchild. 


The love that this man had for his family, 
and this little girl in particular, practically 
jumped off the page. It saddens me deeply 
that Anna won’t grow up knowing more of her 
grandpa, but I am certain that her parents and 
her grandmother will not let her forget him. 
She will grow up strengthened by his leadership, 
his integrity, and his kindness. 

I couldn’t look at Anna’s pictures without 
thinking that, when BOB was her age, he was 
living in an internment camp with other Japanese-
Americans who had been rounded up 
and incarcerated after the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
It was, of course, one of the great stains 
on our Nation’s history, and BOB spent his 
public life trying to somehow correct that ugly 
injustice. I imagine that BOB’s connection to 
Anna was stronger because his own early 
years were so unsettled, because he wanted 
his granddaughter to have a childhood full of 
innocence and happy memories. 

BOB MATSUI stood out in this Chamber—for 
his policy intellect; for his sense of compassion 
and justice; for the esteem he earned on 
both sides of the aisle; but most of all for his 
fundamental decency. That decency was apparent 
in his work, whether he was securing 
flood protection for Sacramento or fighting for 
Social Security. And there’s no question that 
we’ll miss BOB MATSUI’s expertise as we debate 
the future of Social Security this year. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H59 

There was no separation between BOB MATSUI’s 
private virtues and public virtues. They 
were one and the same. He treated everyone 
with respect; he didn’t raise his voice a lot; he 
was a lot more steak than sizzle. To be honest, 
these are qualities that are not in abundance 
around here these days. I hope that our 
memories of BOB MATSUI will lead us to conduct 
ourselves with greater civility in this new 
Congress. 

Very few of us knew that BOB was sick, 
which is why the news of his death came as 
such a shock. But that modesty was consistent 
with the way BOB lived. Rather than go 
public with his illness, he preferred simply to 
be surrounded by the love of his family. 

Of course, even the most unassuming 
among us have another side to them. As I 
was reading the obituary in the Sacramento 
Bee, I was taken aback by one friend’s remembrance—
of a shirtless BOB MATSUI in the 
stands at a Cal football game rabidly rooting 
for his team and challenging the other team’s 
fans. 

Now, if you asked the Members of this body 
to rank their colleagues in order of most likely 
to remove their shirt off at a football game 
... BOB would’ve finished close to 435th of 

435. And remember that includes more than 
70 women. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with BOB’s 
wife, Doris Matsui, whom all of us know as an 
impressive advocate and public servant in her 
own right. And with Brian, Amy and Anna Matsui 
and everyone who loved this dear man. 
BOB MATSUI—rest in peace. 

Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the life of a man who represented 
the best in American politics and government. 

Congressman MATSUI was what many of us 
aspire to be as lawmakers. He was a passionate 
advocate for his constituents, upheld 
the highest ethical standards, and conducted 
himself with the utmost civility. 

He never failed to be there for others who 
were less experienced. When I first ran for 
Congress, he served as my mentor. BOB visited 
my district several times, and we became 
good friends. I appreciated his advice and 
benefited greatly from his expertise on issues 
such as Social Security. 

But I was most impressed with how BOB 
went about his daily business calmly and with 
a composure that helped him gain the respect 
that he deserved. 

His devotion to others was remarkable and 
unrelenting, and he could always be relied 
upon to do the right thing. His contributions to 
our country, particularly on behalf of Japanese 
Americans, will never be forgotten. 

We are all better for his efforts. While I am 
greatly saddened that he is no longer with us, 
it is my honor to be able to recognize and pay 
tribute to such a fine American. 

Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
support this resolution to express profound 
sorrow upon the death of Congressman MATSUI. 
I join my colleagues to honor and remember 
my good friend Congressman BOB MATSUI, 
a true leader in the House of Representatives 
whose passing leaves us all with a sense of 
great loss. 

I would like to thank my colleagues, Congressman 
STARK and Congresswoman 
LOFGREN, and the rest of the California Democratic 
Delegation for their swift leadership to 
pay tribute to our friend, BOB. 

I would like to say ‘‘thank you’’ to Doris, his 
wife and life-long partner, to his son Brian, his 

daughter-in-law Amy, and to his granddaughter 
for sharing him with us in Congress. 
In addition to the adoration of his wonderful 
family, BOB had the love and respect of both 
his constituents and his colleagues. He was a 
courageous and passionate leader who served 
California’s Fifth Congressional District for 26 
years. 

As a Member of Congress and as chair of 
the Congressional Asian Pacific American 
Caucus, CAPAC, I had the honor of working 
with Congressman MATSUI. BOB was instrumental 
in making CAPAC a reality, and served 
as a CAPAC executive board member since 
its inception in 1994. 

Throughout his career, Congressman MATSUI 
championed causes affecting civil liberties 
and immigrants’ rights. As a dedicated member 
of the Asian Pacific Islander American, 
APIA, community, BOB fought for a formal 
apology from our government for its wrongful 
internment of Japanese Americans during 
World War II. Congressman MATSUI and Secretary 
Norman Mineta led the way in passing 
the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. As an American 
of Japanese ancestry, Congressman MATSUI 
helped obtain the land necessary for the National 
Japanese American Memorial, which 
recognizes Japanese American patriotism and 
honors members for never losing faith in the 
basic principles embodied in our Nation’s Constitution. 


Along with Congressman MATSUI and Secretary 
Mineta, I experienced internment as a 
young Japanese American during World War 

II. BOB was only 6-months old when he and 
his family were interned at the Tule Lake 
camp just months after the attack on Pearl 
Harbor. BOB understood the injustice of internment 
and sympathized with the other loyal 
Americans who suffered at the hands of the 
government in which they never lost faith. 
BOB MATSUI listened to people, and set 
about helping them with compassion and dignity. 
Whether he was fighting for flood control 
on behalf of his constituents in Sacramento or 
defending those without a voice, BOB dedicated 
his entire career to public service. From 
the time he worked as a member of the Sacramento 
City Council, to serving as the vice 
mayor of Sacramento, and finally as a U.S. 
Representative starting in 1978, BOB MATSUI 
served as a constant reminder of what integrity 
and dedication can accomplish in public 
office. 

Congressman MATSUI truly believed in the 

U.S. Constitution and its promise of ‘‘a more 
Perfect Union.’’ He relied on those values embedded 
in the Constitution in fights to ensure 
adequate healthcare for children and provide a 
safety net for needy families and the elderly. 
BOB’s leadership as the third ranking Democrat 
on the House Ways and Means Committee 
and the ranking member on the Social 
Security Subcommittee earned him the reputation 
as an expert on tax and trade policy, Social 
Security and welfare programs. In the 
109th Congress, BOB’s presence, heart, and 
soul will be missed during the great debate 
over Social Security. 
Mr. Speaker, BOB MATSUI should ultimately 
be remembered for his civility, his dignity, and 
his service to others. He was a selfless role 
model whose footprint will forever be imprinted 
on our Nation’s history. 

Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and legacy of the 
Honorable ROBERT MATSUI who served Sac


ramento, CA, for 27 years. Just last month, 
Representative MATSUI was reelected to another 
term by a winning percentage of 71.4 
percent. Sadly, he passed from this life on 
New Year’s Day, January 1, 2005. 

For the past 2 years, I have been honored 
to serve with Representative MATSUI on the 
Ways and Means Committee and its Social 
Security Subcommittee. During that time, I observed 
that BOB had a deep understanding of 
Social Security and tax policy, which was reflected 
in his masterful handling of committee 
work and interactions with colleagues. 

He was a Congressperson’s Congressperson. 
He was a great leader. He was generous 
with his time and his talent. He was willing 
to share the limelight. On several occasions 
he invited me to serve as ranking member 
on the Social Security Subcommittee, 
what a privilege. His generosity will be sorely 
missed. 

As the 109th Congress convenes today, it is 
fitting that we honor BOB MATSUI’s legacy. 
During the 109th Congress we will undertake 
discussions on gutting the Social Security program, 
a program that BOB understood as an 
important safety net for not only senior citizens 
but also disabled persons and minor children 
of deceased parents. BOB was a strong proponent 
of the idea that privatizing Social Security 
would lead to its demise by making it financially 
unviable. He worked tirelessly to reform 
the program and make it operate more 
efficiently, without compromising its purpose. 

A biblical proverb states that ‘‘Good men 
must die, but death cannot kill their names.’’ 
Representative ROBERT MATSUI’s legacy will 
live on in the Congress as we continue his 
longstanding work to preserve Social Security 
and our country’s ideals of helping those who 
need and deserve it. We will miss him, but his 
name will not be forgotten. 

Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, the death of 
Congressman ROBERT MATSUI is a tremendous 
loss for his family, the families he represented 
in California and everyone who knew 
him. BOB was a wonderful man, a kind and 
gentle spirit who loved his job and the people 
he worked for, and I feel privileged to have 
served as his colleague in the U.S. House of 
Representatives. 

Throughout his distinguished career in public 
service, Congressman MATSUI, a third generation 
American, vigorously defended justice 
and fairness—values forged very early in his 
life when his family was imprisoned in the Tule 
Lake internment camp in California during 
World War II. Despite being interned as a 
young boy, BOB remained optimistic and determined 
that everyone should be treated 
equally and with respect. He believed in the 
promise of America and took from his experience, 
a strong belief in civil rights as well as 
a passion for public service. 

In Congress, Mr. MATSUI was steadfast in 
acting on these values, championing basic 
rights for all Americans and leading the effort 
in which the U.S. Government formally apologized 
to Japanese Americans for the World 
War II internment program. In the 26 years 
that he served in the U.S. House of Representatives, 
BOB rose to national prominence 
as a senior member of the powerful Ways and 
Means Committee, a national spokesman for 
Social Security, and as the first Asian American 
in the leadership of Congress. 

As a crusader for America’s seniors, Mr. 
MATSUI led the fight to preserve Social Security. 
He reached out to Members, new and old, 


H60 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

helping them understand the complexities of 
Social Security as well as its impact on the 
daily lives of our seniors. 

BOB truly exemplified a gentleman. He 
served with distinction and integrity, winning 
the respect and admiration of all who worked 
with him. 

I extend my deepest condolences to the 
Matsui family—his wife Doris, son Brian, 
daughter-in-law Amy and granddaughter 
Anna—as well as to his staff and the people 
of California. BOB’s integrity, devotion and 
compassion will be greatly missed. 

Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with 
a sad heart to honor a great man, a dedicated 
public servant and a good friend. In our own 
ways, each of us will miss something special 
about BOB MATSUI. Let me share with my colleagues 
my own experience with him. 

BOB MATSUI gave me my first job on Capitol 
Hill. In July, 1979, I went to work for him as 
a part-time assistant, entering constituent information 
into a computer, and then helping to 
write legislative correspondence. BOB was a 
freshman Member then, but even at that time 
I realized he was to have a long and brilliant 
career in the Congress. Twenty-two years 
later we reunited on the floor. Just recently I 
showed him a photograph we took together on 
the steps of the Capitol. The color was faded 
and the paper brittle. But I kept it throughout 
the years to remind me of the first Member of 
Congress who gave me an opportunity in public 
service. 

BOB MATSUI embodied the best values of 
public service. He believed so strongly in opportunity 
here at home and through sensible 
trade policies abroad. It was an honor to have 
had the opportunity to learn from a man who 
put the good of his constituents and of Americans 
generally over partisanship and political 
one-upsmanship. It is a lesson I have strived 
to apply during my own tenure in this body. 

BOB MATSUI set an example for all of us 
with his integrity and dedication. He will be 
greatly missed. 

Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness 
that I rise to express my deepest regrets 
over the loss of my friend and colleague, BOB 
MATSUI. 

My thoughts and prayers are with the Matsui 
family—especially Doris, Brian, Amy, and 
Anna. 

Our country has lost a great leader. BOB 
MATSUI personified integrity and passion. He 
served California and America with great conviction 
and dedication to his beliefs. 

BOB MATSUI was an inspiration to all Americans. 
Although he was taken to a Japanese 
American internment camp at only 6 months 
old, he never gave up his dedication to 
bettering our great country. He later became a 
leader of the movement for redress of Japanese-
Americans interned during World War II. 
Even though much time had passed, he still 
sought justice for all Americans. 

BOB MATSUI also fought tirelessly for America’s 
senior citizens. As ranking member of the 
Social Security Subcommittee, he worked diligently 
to protect seniors’ retirement funds He 
strongly opposed risky schemes to privatize 
Social Security and worked to make seniors 
aware of the faults of these plans. 

As chair of the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee, BOB MATSUI passionately 
believed in the message of the Democratic 
Party, and dedicated himself tirelessly to 
spreading that message. 

BOB MATSUI is an inspiration to all Americans. 
His strong desire to serve his community 
and his country led him to become one of 
the most beloved leaders of this Congress. 

BOB MATSUI will be missed by his country, 
his community, his family and his friends. He 
will long be remembered as a great American 
statesman. 

Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute 
to our departed college, BOB MATSUI. BOB was 
an extraordinarily talented patriot and Member 
of this House. 

BOB’s generation of House Members struck 
out to change the world—or at least change 
their government in the aftermath of Watergate 
and the abuses of power in the Nixon administration. 
He did change the world, representing 
a district in California and representing 
the House on the world stage. 

He was a unique political mind and political 
talent. While he was passionate for caring for 
the less fortunate in our society, he was also 
pragmatic about how democratic ideals and 
reforms come about on the world stage. 

We shared the philosophy that world trade 
engenders better relationships between nations 
and offers a greater opportunity to 
spread democracy to developing nations or 
nations that were not traditionally democratic. 

BOB’s greatest legislative talent—and there 
were many—was his down-to-earth ability to 
comprehend and explain in laymen’s terms all 
matters related to Social Security. In this political 
season when the President has made 
clear his intention to raid Social Security, we 
will most certainly miss BOB’s leadership in 
this important and fundamental debate in Congress. 


Today the Nation says goodbye to a decent 
and big minded colleague. BOB was not afraid 
to learn. And he was not afraid to forgive. 
Even after his family was interned as a child— 
with Japanese Americans at the outbreak of 
WWII—BOB forgave the people who imprisoned 
his family. He forgave his country, then 
he went on to serve this Nation with enormous 
talent. 

BOB wanted to make the world better. He 
did make the world a better place and he 
made the House of Representatives a better 
place given his presence in it. He deeply believed 
in what he said, but he was open 
enough to listen to—and hear—the ideas of 
others, as well. 

I will miss him . . . we will all miss him. And 
we offer our deepest condolences to his dear 
wife, Doris, and his son, Brian. 

Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to 
honor one of our country’s great leaders, and 
a dear friend Congressman ROBERT MATSUI. 

BOB MATSUI was a valued colleague to 
every member of the House. He was a leading 
expert on countless issues that have a profound 
effect on the lives of millions of Americans, 
not the least of which is Social Security. 
From his seat on the Ways and Means Committee, 
BOB fought on behalf of seniors and 
children, and sought to build thoughtful bipartisan 
consensus on one tough issue after another. 


BOB approached this job with grace, fairness, 
and dignity. Even though he was chairman 
of our Party’s political committee, he 
never put partisanship above principle. His intelligence 
was only exceeded by his compassion. 
We always refer to one another as ‘‘gentleman’’ 
and ‘‘gentle lady’’ on this floor, but 
there is no Member of Congress for whom the 

term ‘‘gentleman’’ is more appropriate. It is indeed 
fitting to hold this tribute on the day we 
swear in the new Congress, because the way 
BOB conducted himself should be a model for 
all of us—freshmen and senior Members alike. 

BOB was a cherished friend and valued 
mentor to both my late husband Walter and 
me. When Walter was first elected to Congress, 
BOB was one of the first people he 
sought out to ask for advice on his new job. 
As usual, BOB was generous with his time and 
his wisdom. We both learned much from him 
and I have relied on his policy insights and his 
political instincts more times than I can remember. 
I know that I will still instinctively look 
for him on the floor during a tough vote. 

Mr. Speaker, BOB and Doris Matsui were 
there for my family and for me when Walter 
passed away. Today I extend to Doris, Brian, 
Amy, Anna, and BOB’s staff my most heartfelt 
condolences. I understand how difficult this 
time is for them. But I am buoyed by knowing 
that strength in families is never more evident, 
and important, than during times of adversity 
and grief. The Matsuis are a strong and wonderful 
family, and that, perhaps, is BOB’s finest 
legacy of all. 

We will miss BOB MATSUI very much. But we 
will never, ever forget him. 

Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, this 
past Saturday, our country lost two beloved 
public servants. Representative ROBERT T. 
MATSUI and former Representative Shirley 
Chisholm leave us behind, but our national 
consciousness will never forget their considerable 
contributions to pursuing equality and social 
justice for all Americans. Representatives 
MATSUI and Chisholm dedicated so much of 
themselves to others, and the outpouring of 
support demonstrates the deep impact each 
had on the lives of others. 

Both leaders rose from humble beginnings 
to the heights of Congress. Representative 
MATSUI, one of the thousands of Japanese 
Americans taken to an internment camp during 
World War II, became an influential member 
on the powerful House Ways and Means 
Committee. His passion for social justice 
shaped the core of his being, reverberating 
through his promotion of adequate job training, 
equal access to health care coverage for children, 
and the preservation of Social Security 
for our nation’s seniors and disabled citizens. 
In 1988, he helped win restitution from the 

U.S. Government for the internment program 
that negatively affected many surviving Japanese 
Americans. 
Representative Chisholm too overcame 
great obstacles. As the product of the working 
neighborhoods of Brooklyn, Shirley Chisholm 
became the first African American woman 
elected to Congress in 1968. Her advocacy on 
civil rights issues, particularly women’s rights, 
was unparalleled as she reached out beyond 
her local constituency to all Americans. Never 
willing to allow America to mire in the status 
quo, Representative Chisholm again broke 
new ground by offering herself as the first 
woman to be considered for the Democratic 
presidential nomination in 1972. 

Though I never had the honor of serving 
with Representative Chisholm, her legacy 
echoes throughout the halls of Congress. I witness 
her strength in my colleagues in the 
Congressional Black Caucus, which she 
helped establish in 1969. I hear her voice in 
our continued pleas for justice in underserved 
communities. And I see her focus and passion 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H61 

in the eyes of American children who won’t 
accept discrimination or barriers to opportunity. 


Connected by the common bond of their 
love for humanity, Representatives MATSUI 
and Chisholm treaded down unmarked paths 
with determination, fortitude, and notable 
grace. As a generation of civil rights activists 
move into the twilight of their advocacy, we 
must honor their work by passing along their 
vision for what we our country can still become, 
a land of equality and opportunity for all 
Americans. Though we have lost these dear 
friends too soon, we continue to be led by 
their unmistakable footprints. 

Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
join in paying tribute to one of our colleagues 
whom we lost so unexpectedly on New Year’s 
Day. 

BOB MATSUI was one of the most respected 
Members of this House. During his 26 years of 
service in Congress, he was an advocate for 
our Nation’s seniors, our children, and for social 
and economic justice. 

From his family’s experience in the Japanese 
internment camps during World War II, 
BOB learned the importance of protecting the 
liberties and civil rights that are the foundation 
of this great country. As an Asian-American he 
understood the obstacles that minorities face 
in building opportunities for themselves and 
their families. 

BOB MATSUI rose quickly to become a leader 
in this House because of his political savvy 
and his detailed knowledge of the issues. 

He was dedicated to this House and its institutions. 
He was also dedicated to the ideals 
of the Democratic party. We all know how tirelessly 
he worked as the chairman of the 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 


Many will remember BOB for his leadership 
in our party and on the critical national issues 
of trade and Social Security. 

It is true that he understood the values of 
free trade and the economic prosperity it can 
provide to communities. He was not afraid to 
stand up against even his own party on issues 
in which he passionately believed. As the 
ranking member of the Social Security Subcommittee, 
BOB was also a national expert on 
the subject of retirement and pension. 

His knowledge of the intricacies of the social 
security system and his wisdom will be sorely 
missed during this year’s upcoming debate on 
Social Security reform. 

I, however, will remember BOB for something 
else. I will remember him as a friend and 
champion of migrant children and their families. 
BOB helped us in the fight for funding for 
Migrant Education Programs. For years he 
also hosted a college assistance migrant intern 
in his office. 

Many of his former interns are now leaders 
in their professions and communities because 
of the start BOB gave them. 

I want to express my deepest condolences 
to his family: his wife Doris, his son Brian, his 
daughter-in-law Amy and his granddaughter 
Anna. I know how proud BOB was of all of 
them. The people of California and of this Nation 
have truly lost a great advocate. 

Mr. SABO. Mr. Speaker, my family and I 
would like to convey our heartfelt sympathy to 
the Matsui family upon the death of Congressman 
ROBERT MATSUI on Saturday, January 1. 

BOB’s passing is a tragic loss to all who 
knew him. It is also a loss to all Americans 

who didn’t know him personally but whose 
lives were enhanced by the legislation and the 
leadership he provided. BOB was one of the 
smartest and most principled people in Congress, 
a dedicated public servant, and a 
friend. He will be greatly missed in Congress, 
especially by me. 

First elected 26 years ago, Congressman 
MATSUI and I entered the U.S. House of Representatives 
in the same incoming class. We 
were colleagues and friends throughout these 
years; our families each moved to the Washington 
area and our wives Sylvia and Doris 
also became good friends. One of my fond 
memories together was attending Brian and 
Amy’s wedding in California a few years ago. 
Brian also gave me my first official tour of the 

U.S. Supreme Court facilities where he 
clerked recently. His parents were so proud. 
Sylvia and I are shocked and deeply saddened 
by BOB’s passing, and we offer Doris 
and the Matsui family our most sincere condolences. 


Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my late colleague ROBERT T. 
MATSUI. While his life was cut tragically short, 
his many achievements and contributions to 
our Nation will serve as a constant reminder of 
his hard work, integrity, and determination to 
advocate for those who were not able to fight 
for themselves. 

Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives 
in 1978, BOB served the people of Sacramento 
for 14 terms focusing on the city’s 
public safety by bringing adequate flood protection 
to his hometown. He also served as a 
senior member of the Committee on Ways 
and Means, covering an array of policy issues 
such as preserving Social Security for future 
generations, as well as having adequate basic 
healthcare rights for children. Most recently he 
served as chairman of the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee leading the 
Democratic Party’s congressional effort for the 
2004 cycle. 

When he was 6 months old, BOB, a third-
generation Japanese American, and his family 
were taken from their home in Sacramento 
and interned at the Tule Lake Camp after Japan’s 
attack on Pearl Harbor in 1942. He carried 
this experience with him throughout his 
life. In 1988, he helped steer the Japanese-
American Redress Act through Congress, in 
which the government formally apologized for 
the World War II internment program and offered 
compensation to victims. This experience 
helped shape his strong belief that every 
American is entitled to basic civil rights despite 
their ethnicity. 

BOB was also a member of the Executive 
Committee of the Congressional Asian Pacific 
American Caucus. Because of his many 
achievements and contributions, he was and 
always will be a role model to the more than 
eleven million Americans of Asian and Pacific 
Islander descent in our country. 

His presence and driving force will certainly 
be missed. However, his legacy will live on 
through the people of Sacramento, the Asian 
Pacific Islander American community and our 
Nation as a whole. I offer my deepest condolences 
to his wife, Doris, son, Brian, daughter-
in-law, Amy and granddaughter, Anna. We will 
miss you, BOB. All Hawaii sends with you on 
your final journey our deepest and most loving 
Aloha. 

Mr. CARDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute 
to my colleague and friend, BOB MATSUI. 

As Members of Congress, many factors determine 
who we form close relationships with. 
One of those factors is committee assignment. 
I had the tremendous fortune of serving on the 
Ways and Means Committee with BOB MATSUI 
for 15 years. As we worked on tax reform, 
trade, health, and many other issues, I learned 
many valuable lessons from him. His dedication 
to the people of his district and to all the 
people of this Nation shone through at every 
hearing and markup. 

He had a lifelong commitment to public 
service and the public good. Even though his 
early years were spent in a Japanese-American 
internment camp in California, that injustice 
did not dim his love and devotion to our 
country. He remained in California, served on 
the Sacramento City Council, and as vice 
mayor of Sacramento, and eventually came to 
this House, which he also loved so very much. 

For his entire career, he was devoted to the 
welfare of children, the promotion of free 
trade, and the preservation of Social Security 
for future generations. I know that the committee 
will miss his expertise and good counsel 
for many Congresses to come. I want to 
personally extend my heartfelt condolences to 
his wonderful wife Doris, his son Brian, daughter 
in-law Amy, and his granddaughter Anna. 
We will miss BOB and forever treasure his camaraderie. 


Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, this 
week our Nation has lost a great leader and 
statesman from my home State of California, 
BOB MATSUI. And it is with a great deal of sadness 
that I join my colleagues to pay tribute to 
BOB’s life and his distinguished record of service 
and accomplishments during his 26 years 
as a Member of the House of Representatives. 
A model of integrity and commitment to 
his district, his State and our Nation, BOB exemplified 
the best of this great institution. 

By having the privilege of representing an 
area of Los Angeles with a rich and diverse 
Asian-American population that includes Little 
Tokyo, Koreatown, Filipinotown, and Chinatown, 
I am very aware of the positive impact 
BOB had on the Asian-Pacific Islander community 
and the Japanese-American community in 
particular. Like so many Japanese-Americans, 
BOB’s early years were spent with his family in 
an internment camp during World War II. Anyone 
viewing the large photo of a youthful BOB 
MATSUI with his little league baseball teammates 
which adorns his office wall was reminded 
of the difficult challenge an Asian-
American faced growing up in 1950’s California. 
As a young man in that volatile ethnic 
environment, BOB MATSUI was a stand-out student 
who gained admittance to the University 
of California at Berkeley and distinguished 
himself academically both there and at the 
Hastings College of Law. 

His early experience became the foundation 
of his academic success as a young man, and 
ultimately led him to a career of distinguished 
public service, first for his local Sacramento 
City Council, then to this great House. His respect 
for this institution and his personal and 
professional integrity were well-known and 
helped BOB become a persuasive advocate on 
the issues he cared deeply about. 

As a member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee 
of the Appropriations Committee, I 
was honored to work with him on one of the 
most important issues to California—water. 
BOB’s knowledge of water issues affecting our 
State, including southern California, and his 


H62 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

long record of support for adequate flood control 
protection for the Sacramento area were 
brought to bear each year during our committee 
deliberations as we set priorities for 
funding the water projects so crucial to Sacramento 
and to California. 

BOB was also a strong advocate of trade 
and of protecting the rights of our senior citizens. 
In fact, as the ranking Democrat on the 
Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, 
BOB was our Democratic expert and a 
leading advocate for the protection of this critical 
program. BOB was to be our Democratic 
point person for the upcoming and pivotal debate 
on Social Security. Understanding the importance 
of Social Security to our Nation’s 
seniors and the need for the Democratic Party 
to effectively and successfully confront attacks 
on the system, his wife Doris told me that BOB 
continued to plan a Democratic strategy to the 
very end at Bethesda Naval Hospital. 

It was this kind of commitment coupled with 
his integrity and sincerity that helped to make 
BOB one of the most respected Members of 
Congress. This respect also made him one of 
the most successful chairmen of the Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee. 
We all know that the DCCC set many records 
during the 2003–2004 election cycle. I believe 
this success stemmed from the leadership 
model that BOB conveyed at the DCCC’s 
helm, and it was also a result of the great esteem 
in which BOB was held by all segments 
of our party. I was proud to serve with him as 
vice-chair of the DCCC, and BOB made sure 
it was indeed a working position. Few Members 
could have motivated me in quite the 
same way as BOB MATSUI. 

In short, I will miss BOB as a friend and colleague. 
This House, the Democratic Party, 
and our Nation have lost a great statesman 
and a quiet and effective leader. His legacy of 
accomplishments as a trail-blazing Asian-
American Californian is unlikely to be surpassed. 
His dedication, dignity, and bipartisan 
approach to addressing the Nation’s problems 
will be the hallmark of his legacy for both Republicans 
and Democrats. 

In this time of extreme partisanship and frequent 
legislative gridlock, it is my hope that we 
can all learn from the example of our friend 
and colleague, BOB MATSUI. 

Mr. OXLEY. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues 
in paying tribute to Congressman BOB 
MATSUI of California. The American people will 
miss this outstanding public servant, and we in 
the House of Representatives will miss a 
skilled legislator who approached every issue 
with a fair mind. 

I’ve lost a friend. BOB and his wife Doris 
were friends of my wife Pat and me. Our son 
Chadd and their son, Brian, grew up together 
as congressional kids. 

For the past 2 years, BOB and I were 
hallmates. In fact, I moved into his old office 
on the third floor of the Rayburn building. He 
always had a smile and hello for anyone he 
passed in the hall, whether it was a fellow 
Member, a staffer, or a visitor. 

BOB MATSUI was a courageous legislator. 
He showed great resolve in helping to win approval 
for the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. There isn’t a tax or trade bill in the 
last 20 years that doesn’t have his stamp on 
it. He was positively heroic when he had Congress 
squarely face the issue of the treatment 
of Japanese-Americans during World War II. 
BOB MATSUI showed us the meaning of dignity 

and humility as he helped us to acknowledge 
a wrong. He and his parents were among 
those held in internment camps, but what was 
more important to him than his personal history 
was righting history for thousands of innocent 
Americans. 

Our thoughts and prayers are with BOB’s 
family. As we start a new session of Congress, 
we should all look to the distinguished 
career of BOB MATSUI as an example of how 
we can remain true to our ideals and beliefs 
while ultimately working together for the good 
of all Americans. 

Ms. BONO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor a respected colleague in the U.S. Congress 
whose recent passing will be mourned 
by all who knew him. With Congressman ROBERT 
MATSUI’s untimely death, America has lost 
a tireless leader. 

As a fellow Californian, I had the pleasure of 
working with Congressman MATSUI on several 
issues of importance to our State. I admired 
his leadership and dedication to his constituency 
as well as the high level of integrity with 
which he served. 

Congressman MATSUI’s 26 years of service 
are filled with a remarkable number of legislative 
achievements such as his commitment to 
free trade that have bettered the lives of many 
Americans. He was a powerful and respected 
voice whose memory will continue to be an inspiration 
for many years to come. 

Congressman ROBERT MATSUI was a true 
leader and served his constituents and country 
with honor and distinction. The people of Sacramento, 
California were fortunate to have 
such a talented person for their Representative 
in Congress. 

I will always remember Congressman MATSUI’s 
thoughtfulness; he was always quick with 
a smile and a kind word. He was a bridge for 
communication between both sides of the 
aisle. His legacy of effective leadership will be 
a model for those that follow him. 

My thoughts and prayers are with Doris and 
the entire Matsui family during this difficult 
time. Congressman MATSUI’s positive impact 
on his country will be remembered forever. 

Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great sadness that I rise today to honor a valued 
colleague and true gentleman, the late 
Congressman BOB MATSUI. I met him when I 
served as a state legislator within his congressional 
district in Sacramento. Since that time, 
I have been taken by his approachability and 
his ability to make those around him feel that 
he is truly listening to their concerns. 

During his 26 years in Congress, he has 
been a champion on issues that affect the 
lives of all Californians and Americans, from 
protecting Social Security to working for civil 
rights. Congressman MATSUI’s fight against 
privatizing Social Security showed his deep 
commitment to fighting for the poor or less fortunate 
in our country. He led the efforts to ensure 
its fundamental purpose was never compromised. 


Congressman MATSUI’s strong belief in social 
justice is apparent by looking at the legislation 
he championed. He drafted bills that became 
the backbone for child welfare reform, 
proposing to expand the social services available 
to at-risk children and families in the child 
welfare, mental health and juvenile justice systems. 
He also fought welfare changes, arguing 
that adequate job training and education programs 
were essential to helping parents become 
self-sufficient. And his bipartisan work to 

provide health care coverage to uninsured 
children became the basis of the State Children’s 
Health Insurance Program. 

His personal journey, however, could be his 
most lasting legacy. After spending his infancy 
in an internment camp during World War II, 
Congressman MATSUI led the legislative effort 
to compensate victims of the camps and officially 
apologize to those held there. A grateful 
Japanese-American community is indebted to 
his work, as are the rest of us. 

I want to send my prayers and condolences 
to his family: his wife Doris, son Brian, daughter-
in-law Amy and granddaughter Anna. For 
those of us who remain in Congress, we 
would like you to know that we will continue to 
fight for the causes and ideals that BOB fought 
for his entire life. 

Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I am saddened by 
the sudden loss of ROBERT MATSUI, and I 
would like to join my colleagues in honoring 
him today. BOB was one of the finest members 
to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
His strength of character, wisdom, civility, 
and attention to detail were inspiring to 
many of us serving with him. His thoughtful 
and helpful nature has been remembered by 
many today, but I will always be grateful for 
his desire to seek out and befriend younger 
and less senior Members of Congress like me. 
I join my colleagues in mourning the loss of a 
friend, a mentor, and a great leader in Congress. 


Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speaker, it is 
with sadness that I recognize the death of a 
former colleague and a great Californian, Representative 
ROBERT MATSUI, who passed away 
earlier this week. 

A third-generation Japanese-American, BOB 
was born in Sacramento and was just a 6-
month-old baby when he and his family were 
imprisoned at the Tule Lake internment camp 
following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. 
Forty years later, he was instrumental in passing 
the Japanese-American Redress Act, 
which produced an official apology from the 
Federal Government for the World War II internment 
program and offered compensation 
to victims. 

BOB was a quiet and admired Member of 
Congress. His passion for issues he believed 
deeply in was respected by his colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle. He brought dignity and 
honor to the House of Representatives. BOB 
was a tax and trade maven on the House 
Ways and Means Committee, and his knowledge 
and expertise in these areas will be 
sorely missed. He was one of a small number 
of Democrats who pushed for passage of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement. 

First elected in 1978 following his service to 
the City of Sacramento, BOB and I were in the 
same freshman class of Congress as I too 
was elected that year. I got to know, and become 
very good friends with BOB during the 
26 years we served in the House together. 

The people in the Sacramento-based 5th 
district lost a good legislator when BOB passed 
away on January 1, and he will be missed by 
his friends and family. 

It is with a heavy heart that I say good-bye 
to BOB. My wife Cheryl and I would like to express 
our condolences to his wife, Doris, and 
the entire family, in this time of sorrow and 
sadness. They will be in our prayers. 

Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, it is with a sad 
heart that I rise today to honor my colleague, 
the Honorable ROBERT T. MATSUI. Far before 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H63 

these past 4 years where I had the opportunity 
to work with him in Washington, BOB’s work 
effort, faith and determination were a constant 
source of inspiration for me. 

BOB fought in Congress for 28 years on 
principles that were unshakeable for the betterment 
of all. He took a genuine interest in 
Members’ concerns, visited Members’ districts—
including mine in the San Gabriel Val-
ley—and fought hard to ensure equality for the 
underserved and to bring justice to those 
wronged. BOB was a champion for Social Security, 
fought for all of our children and was 
determined to achieve economic justice. 

I am proud to say that BOB MATSUI is 
among those I consider a close personal 
friend. I send my condolences to his family 
and I am consoled only by knowing that BOB’s 
legacy will live on, and the world will be better 
for it.

Speaker, I yield back the balance of

SUPPORTING THE TSUNAMI 
VICTIMS 

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of January 
4, 2005, the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. WILSON) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, as the previous cochair of the 
Congressional Caucus on India and Indian 
Americans, I rise to express our 
solidarity with the people of India and 
the Indian American community in the 
aftermath of the devastating tsunami 
that has affected so many nations in 
the Indian Ocean. 

Earlier tonight, a resolution of sympathy 
for South Asia was presented by 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. HYDE) 
and the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LANTOS), chairman and ranking member 
of the Committee on International 
Relations, along with the gentleman 
from Iowa (Mr. LEACH), who is leading 
a delegation to the affected areas, and 
the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BURTON), 
Indonesian Caucus cochairman. 

Nearly 140,000 people in 11 countries 
in South Asia and East Africa have 
died, approximately 3 to 5 million people 
have been displaced and citizens of 
over 40 countries have been affected by 
the tsunami. The most devastating 
death toll was in the nation of Indonesia, 
which is appreciated as the 
world’s largest Muslim democracy of 
nearly a quarter of a billion people. 
India has nearly 15,000 casualties. In 
this time of need, the American people 
and our government are demonstrating 
the generosity and compassion that 
have been the hallmark of American 
society and culture since our Nation’s 
founding. 

As we grieve for the dead, we must 
also continue to work hard to save 
those now living in the wake of this 
terrible disaster. Under the leadership 
of President George W. Bush, America 
has committed $350 million in relief to 
the nations in need. This substantial 
funding will go a long way to helping 
the estimated 3 to 5 million people who 
now face numerous hardships as they 
lack access to the basic necessities of 
life. 

Our country and our people are also 
contributing to this effort in countless 
other ways. Almost immediately after 
the disaster occurred, the United 
States military dispatched aircraft and 
ships to survey the damage and deliver 
supplies. Presently there are disaster 
relief assessment teams on the ground 
and 20 ships and 80 military aircraft in 
the area and en route, with 12,600 
American military serving the relief 
effort. The U.S. Pacific Command said 
this week it is deploying 20 ships from 
docks in Hong Kong, Guam and the island 
of Diego Garcia. The ships are 
loaded with medical equipment and 

Colin Powell and Governor Jeb Bush of 
Florida are tonight visiting the devastated 
nations of South Asia, proving 
our sincere efforts for reconstruction 
and recovery. Additionally, the United 
States Department of Defense and 
USAID have established coordination 
centers in Bangkok, Thailand, and 
Colombo, Sri Lanka. These centers will 
help coordinate the massive U.S. relief 
efforts. 

As the world has witnessed throughout 
our history, the American men and 
women in uniform always act boldly to 
help those in need. 

Over the past week, I have been most 
encouraged by the outpouring of support 
from the American people. Since 
December 26, Americans have contributed 
hundreds of millions of dollars to 
help those in need. Yesterday President 
Bush asked President George H.W. 
Bush and President Bill Clinton to 
head a nationwide charitable fund-raising 
effort. In the coming days they will 
urge all Americans to donate directly 
to reliable charities already providing 
help to tsunami victims. My colleagues, 
as you advise your constituents 
as you receive inquiries where to 
send contributions, I have two suggestions 
that I would want to suggest to 
you that I have learned in working 
with the Embassy of India here in 
Washington. First is the Prime Minister’s 
National Relief Fund which is 
the Embassy of India at 2107 Massachusetts 
Avenue Northwest, Washington 

D.C. 20008. Additionally in India itself, 
the Tsunami Disaster Relief Fund of 
the American Chamber of Commerce of 
India, the AmCham, which is Room 
1262, Maurya Sheraton Hotel, S.P. 
Marg, New Delhi, India. Both of these 
are organizations that will work to 
help in the recovery and restoration for 
the people who have been affected by 
the tsunami. 
I am confident that this effort will 
further highlight the tremendous decency 
of the American people. In the 
1840s, historian Alexis de Tocqueville 
wrote, ‘‘When America asks for the cooperation 
of its citizens, it is seldom 
refused. And I have often seen it afforded 
spontaneously with great good 
will.’’ 

Most importantly, we should all remember 
that no contribution is too 
small. President Bush has asked that 
we all contribute as we are able to do 
so and fortunately citizens are responding 
in innovative ways. In my home 
State of South Carolina, an 11-year-old 
girl donated $11 she collected at her 
birthday party. In Columbia, South 
Carolina, Jack Edgerton, corporate 
president of Adluh Flour Company, and 
the Allen family recently demonstrated 
another example of the concern 
and compassion exhibited by the 
American people. They have offered to 
send nearly 100,000 pounds of flour from 
the farmers of South Carolina to af


medicine in Indonesia and speaks Indonesian. 
He has volunteered to return to 
provide medical assistance. 

These efforts exemplify the President’s 
statement that ‘‘the greatest 
source of Americans’ generosity is not 
our government, it is the good heart of 
the American people.’’ While the full 
impact of this disaster may never be 
known, the significant contribution of 
the American people will be remembered. 
I join President Bush in urging 
all Americans to give generously to 
this important cause. 

Since citizens of over 40 nations have 
been affected by the tsunami, this is 
truly a global event. As a member of 
the Congressional Caucus on India and 
Indian Americans, I am pleased that 
President Bush visited the Indian Embassy 
here in Washington yesterday to 
pledge that we would help the Indian 
government and the Indian people in 
any way we can. After losing over 
15,000 of its own people, the country of 
India has responded selflessly to this 
tragedy. India is now part of a disaster 
relief coalition with Japan, Australia 
and the United States. Yesterday, 
India began deploying Israeli-made unmanned 
aerial vehicles in round-the-
clock searches for victims of the tsunami. 
By providing significant financial 
and military assistance to neighboring 
tsunami affected countries, 
India is already playing a vital role in 
this coalition. 

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ROS-
LEHTINEN), the new India Caucus co-
chair who succeeded me today, has also 
expressed her support to the people of 
India. It was an honor for me to co-
chair the largest country caucus in 
Congress and I am pleased to have 
worked with people like the gentleman 
from California (Mr. ROYCE) my predecessor, 
the gentlewoman from New 
York (Mrs. KELLY), the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. KNOLLENBERG), and 
other leaders in our work with the Indian 
American community.

As a real estate attorney in South 
Carolina, I worked with Indian Americans 
for nearly 30 years in the hospitality, 
medical, and business sectors; 
and I have always appreciated the 
strong family values, entrepreneurship, 
and patriotism they have shown in our 
communities. There has been no better 
or finer example of this than the recent 
elections of the gentleman from Louisiana 
(Mr. JINDAL) to Congress and 
Nikki Randhawa of Lexington, South 
Carolina to the South Carolina statehouse 
where she recently was elected 
president of the freshman class. They 
embody the hard work and drive that 
so many Indian Americans have fulfilling 
the American Dream. 
At such a critical time, it is important 
we stand beside the people of India 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H65 

identified today in the gentleman from 
Illinois’s (Speaker HASTERT) acceptance 
speech as the world’s largest democracy, 
as America is the world’s oldest 
democracy. Our two nations share 
the same values. I am confident with 
the proven generosity of Americans we 
will again demonstrate by our assistance 
to the people of South Asia to 
help recover from this terrible tragedy. 

Tonight I am very grateful to be 
joined by the gentleman from Michigan 
(Mr. EHLERS), a person of extraordinary 
credentials, a person serving in 
Congress who is a dedicated scientist, a 
graduate, a Ph.D. in nuclear physics 
from the University of California at 
Berkeley, a professor at Calvin College 
in Michigan, and a person, again, who 
has a deep understanding and appreciation 
of science and what it can mean to 
improve the lives of the American people 
and the people of South Asia. 

I yield to the gentleman from Michigan. 


Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding to me. I certainly 
appreciate his sponsoring this 
particular Special Order and particularly 
his encouragement of the American 
people to contribute. 

We are impressed that the President 
has designated $350 million to deal with 
this tragedy, but I would like to point 
out that that is very little more than 
$1 per person this country and very little 
more than $2 for every working person 
in this country. Certainly we can 
do better than that, and I encourage all 
Americans to send contributions to the 
charities that the gentleman mentioned. 
I would also mention the American 
Red Cross will play a role in this 
through its international arms. I am 
also aware in my community of relief 
organizations such as the Christian Reform 
World Relief Committee, which is 
very active in this. International Aid is 
another organization in Spring Lake, 
Michigan, which has dispatched $3 million 
of medical equipment and other 
supplies already. And I am sure every 
American can look around their own 
community and find similar organizations 
that they can contribute to to 
help during this incredible tragedy. 

We certainly want to express our 
sympathy as the American Congress 
and the American country to the people 
who have suffered this tragedy. It is 
almost incomprehensible. For years 
scientists have talked about the possibility 
of a mega-tsunami and it has 
largely been dismissed even though 
tsunamis can be very large, but the 
idea of a mega-tsunami has been dismissed 
by most scientists. This one 
does not quite measure up to that in 
terms of the power and the energy it 
contained, but it certainly is a mega-
tsunami in terms of the damage and 
the death, the destruction that it has 
caused. So I do want to express my personal 
sympathy and that of the Congress 
for those who are suffering and 
encourage all Americans to help. 

But the main thrust of my comments 
this evening are going to be about the 

science of tsunamis. That may seem inappropriate 
at this point when we are 
all dealing with a tragedy, but I know 
there is a lot of interest because I have 
fielded a number of questions from colleagues 
and staff in the Congress, and 
so I think it is worth time talking to 
our colleagues about what a tsunami 
is, how it happens, particularly as it 
relates to the possibility of developing 
a warning system for tsunamis. 

First question, how do tsunamis 
occur? They have four major sources. 
Earthquakes are the primary source 
but also volcanos can cause tsunamis 
either through eruption or collapse. 
Other possibilities are landslides, 
slumps, or rock falls. If they are large 
enough, they can cause tsunamis. The 
last category is more esoteric. Asteroids, 
meteorites. They are very rare, 
but they cause the largest tsunamis. 
And also man-made explosions, which 
many people think could cause them, 
but, in fact, it would be very difficult 
to do that. I will discuss each of these 
a bit later. 

But let me also address, first of all, 
why we cannot warn people. And I 
should mention some have asked me 
why the name ‘‘tsunami,’’ why do we 
use that. Do we not have an American 
term? Actually we do not have an 
equivalent American term. It is from 
two Japanese words that mean harbor 
and wave, and that is literally what it 
is. It is primarily waves in harbors or 
coastlines. 

If we look at the natural disasters we 
have in this world and the warning systems 
that we have, if we look at the 
very largest natural disasters, such as 
volcanic explosions, we generally have 
hours to months of warning time before 
a volcano will explode, and the 
emphasis is generally on months provided 
we have seismic devices measure 
the activity within the volcano. Hurricanes, 
we have days in which to prepare 
and to evacuate or to tighten up 
our homes or other buildings. 
Tsunamis, we could have hours of 
warning if we have a good warning system, 
and that is the big ‘‘if,’’ which I 
will talk about a bit later. 

Tornadoes we generally have 10 minutes 
to an hour of warning. And earthquakes 
we have no warning whatsoever. 
We know of no good warning system 
for earthquakes. Although there 
are some precursors, we can never predict 
an earthquake precisely. And since 
earthquakes cause most tsunamis, that 
means it is very difficult to predict 
tsunamis. But because they take from 
minutes to hours to reach the shore 
once we detect the earthquake and detect 
whether or not it causes a tsunami, 
we do have some warning time 
available and we have a warning system 
in the Pacific Ocean, which has 
been quite successful. 

Let us talk about some of the science 
behind tsunamis. Why do they occur? 
What is going on? How does an earthquake 
cause a tsunami? First of all, 
not all earthquakes do. If it is an 
earthquake that does not cause much 

shifting of the surface under the ocean, 
there is generally not much of a tsunami. 
Also if it is a weak earthquake, 
it generally does not create a tsunami. 
But if we have a large earthquake, let 
us say above about 7.0, in that neighborhood, 
on the Richter Scale, and if it 
involves substantial motion of material, 
we will get a tsunami. 

And the most common way in which 
these are called is when there is a sub-
deduction, when a tectonic plate sliding 
under another tectonic plate in the 
ocean and if there is a big movement 
and if it extends for many miles or 
many kilometers in the direction, we 
get a lot of motion in a very quick 
time. The water pours in to try to fill 
up that space. It is sort of like throwing 
a rock in a pond, and we get ripples 
coming up. But if we are talking about 
an ocean, and a typical ocean depth is 
in the neighborhood of, let us say, 
15,000 feet, we have a huge amount of 
water being moved in a very short 
time, and it is like throwing a very, 
very, very large rock in the ocean. 

The waves that spread out from this 
disturbance are not very big. Typically 
the wave that is caused by an earthquake 
or an underwater volcano will 
only have a height ranging from a few 
inches to a few feet. So the waves that 
are traveling across the ocean are barely 
noticeable to a ship that is sailing 
on the ocean. And that is why we have 
this strange situation, terrible destruction 
around the Indian Ocean now, but 
the fishermen who were out in their 
ships were not injured. They scarcely 
even knew that they were lifted up a 
foot and then let down again as the 
wave went under. But the waves are 
very deep; and as they approach shore, 
it becomes shallower. All of that energy 
of motion is condensed together 
and the waves add together and create 
huge walls of water that hit the coast 
and travel inland from the coast. 

So if we have an earthquake, a volcano, 
a landslide, a slump, a rock fall, 
anything that generates motion of a 
lot of water, as that spreads out across 
the ocean, it loses a little energy but 
not very much, and depending on the 
depth of the ocean, it can travel very 
rapidly. If the ocean is deep, we can get 
speeds of these waves on the order of 
the speed of a jet airplane. And it is 
just a tremendous speed to travel. That 
is why we do not have much warning 
time, because they travel very rapidly. 

As they approach shore, as I said, 
they slow down, mount up, and we get 
this huge wall of water. And it depends 
entirely upon the geology of the area, 
the shape of the land, the nature of the 
source of the earthquake. One of the 
most destructive that occurred was the 
one up in Alaska some years ago, and 
it was not that large an earthquake, 
but the wall of water that hit the land 
was over 100 feet high. It hit a reinforced 
concrete lighthouse and demolished 
it and killed everyone inside. It 
had that kind of force, much more 
force than we had in the Indian Ocean 
last week, but it did not have as great 


H66 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE January 4, 2005 

an extent. Interestingly enough, that 
tsunami which was close to Alaska did 
cause substantial damage in Hawaii 
and killed more people in Hawaii than 
it did in Alaska because Alaska is not 
very heavily populated and Hawaii is. 

So we have many different sources of 
tsunamis, and I hesitate to go into a 
great deal of detail on that. I do want 
to point out for the people who like to 
be terrified or those who like to make 
movies to terrify people that the largest 
tsunamis, as I mentioned, would result 
from asteroids or meteorites. If 
one of those lands in an ocean area, we 
would have a tsunami that could totally 
decimate all of the surrounding 
coastal area for miles inland. That has 
happened in the past geological history 
of this planet; but, in fact, it is quite 
rare. Usually the time between those is 
measured in millions of years, sometimes 
many millions of years. 

What about the warning system? As I 
said earlier, we do have the Pacific 
warning system. It has worked fairly 
well. What we have to do is have a good 
system to detect earthquakes since 
they are the main cause and seismographs 
that could not only detect 
earthquakes but could detect a volcanic 
explosion or a volcanic collapse, 
anything that would move a lot of material 
and therefore create a big hole 
for the water to pour into or else an explosion 
that would make the water 
move out. 

So if we have the seismographs that 
can detect that, then we have to have 
a method of calculating where the 
earthquake occurred, and we have that 
in many parts of the world. Unfortunately 
it took a while to establish the 
exact location of the earthquake in the 
Indian Ocean and find out its magnitude 
and find out really what the 
danger was. And then that tells us the 
starting time of the tsunami. 

Then we have to be able to detect the 
motion of it, the velocity. So we have 
to have buoys displaced around that 
can measure these waves I mentioned, 
which are not all that large; but we 
have to have a buoy system that can 
detect that so we can calculate the 
speed. 

And above all we need a warning system 
that will send out a warning to the 
people in the countries that are going 
to be hit. That is where we completely 
failed in the Indian Ocean, because no 
one expected a tsunami of this size in 
the Indian Ocean. The Pacific system 
has worked reasonably well, but even 
then we cannot always predict far 
enough in advance exactly where it is 
going to hit and how hard it is going to 
hit. And as I said before, not every 
earthquake results in a tsunami. 

So we are going to have false alarms. 
We may send out the alert and the people 
will all quickly evacuate the coastal 
areas, get to high ground, and there 
is just a minor little wave that comes 
in. It is like the boy who cried wolf. If 
this happens several times, people say, 
well, it is a good warning system, but 
we really do not need it. But we never 

know when the big one is going to 
come, so people have to be trained to 
follow the warning system no matter 
what and recognize that not every time 
will it result in a major tsunami in 
every location that is warned, but 
sometime it will. 

I believe it is incumbent upon us to 
lead the way as we have in developing 
the Pacific Ocean tsunami detection 
system which has saved a lot of lives. 
We cannot protect against a tsunami; 
so we cannot stop the property damage. 
But at least we can save the lives. 

b 2115 
We know how to do it. The problem 
is, the nations around the Indian Ocean 
and in other threatened areas are going 
to have to join the effort and, above 
all, they are going to have to develop a 
warning system and train their people 
how the warning system will work and 
how tsunamis work so that they will 
take the warning seriously and flee to 
high ground at the first indication of 
any disaster of this sort. 
I thank the gentleman for yielding 
me time, and I hope I have not taken 
too much time. But as I said, since so 
many people are interested in the nature 
and the science behind tsunamis, I 
thought this might be helpful, particularly 
as this Congress will be involved 
in the next year or 2 in helping to decide 
on what type of warning system 
should be developed worldwide and 
what our role is going to be in that. 
Lest we think that all the tsunamis 
are in the Pacific, just because the majority 
are, be aware that there is potential 
for huge tsunamis in the Atlantic 
and, as we all know, we have a 
heavily populated Atlantic coastline, 
New York City just to name one major 
population center, but all the way from 
Maine down to Miami. We will have to 
worry about it. And the likelihood of it 
is small, but if it occurs, the probability 
of major damage is so high that 
we should not just concentrate on the 
Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, but 
we should also worry about the Atlantic 
Ocean and our eastern seaboard. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman. It was 
certainly very helpful to have the gentleman 
explain tsunamis and the effect 
and how precautions can be taken. We 
greatly appreciate the gentleman’s excellent 
scientific background that can 
be so helpful. I know I particularly represent 
the low country of South Carolina, 
and we are certainly observing 
what has occurred in south Asia and we 
identify with our beaches of Hilton 
Head Island; it is a concern. But I 
thank the gentleman so much for his 
service. 
Mr. Speaker, as I complete my service 
as the cochair of the India Caucus, 
I want to give a special thanks to Dino 
Tepparo who is the legislative assistant 
and attorney of the office of the 
second district of South Carolina. I 
give so much credit to him for helping 
build the largest caucus on Capitol 
Hill. He also developed the website for 

the India Caucus, and he has really 
made a difference in trying for better 
relations between the world’s largest 
democracy of India and the oldest democracy 
of the United States. And 
Dino Tepparo is a person, I greatly appreciate 
his efforts. 

Mr. Speaker, also I want to review 
the significance of this tragedy on so 
many different points, because it is so 
massive that it is almost overwhelming, 
as was indicated by the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. EHLERS) of 
the magnitude of what the people of 
the world are facing. As to the disaster 
background itself, on Sunday, December 
26, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake off 
the West Coast of northern Sumatra, 
Indonesia triggered massive tsunamis 
that affected several countries 
throughout South and Southeast Asia 
as well as Somalia, Tanzania, and 
Kenya in East Africa. Aftershocks continued 
to occur in the region through 
January 1, when a magnitude 6.5 earthquake 
occurred off the west coast of 
northern Sumatra. 

The current situation. The estimated 
death toll from the December 26 earthquake 
and tsunamis is more than 
140,000 people in South and Southeast 
Asia and East Africa and may be as 
high as 150,000. Between 3 million to 5 
million people throughout the affected 
region are lacking basic survival requirements, 
access to clean water, adequate 
shelter, food, sanitation, and 
health care. Contaminated water 
sources in the affected countries have 
increased the risk of cholera, dysentery, 
malaria, and dengue fever. 

Approximately 500,000 people are displaced 
in Indonesia. More than 889,175 
are displaced in Sri Lanka. Mr. Speaker, 
3.5 million people are affected in 
India, and more than 10,000 are injured 
in Thailand. In addition, between 15,000 
and 30,000 may have been affected in 
Somalia, 12,000 are displaced in Malaysia, 
and approximately 12,000 are displaced 
and 300,000 affected in the 
Maldives. 

The American response. On December 
31, President Bush pledged $350 million 
in relief and recovery assistance, bringing 
the total amount of pledges from 
donor countries and the World Bank to 
an estimated $2 billion. The United 
States is leading a core group of nations 
to help with immediate humanitarian 
relief, rehabilitation, and long-
term reconstruction efforts, including 
India, Japan, and Australia. 

On January 2, U.S. Secretary of State 
Colin Powell led a delegation of U.S. 
officials, including Florida Governor 
Jeb Bush, to visit the disaster-stricken 
areas of Asia. The United States Pacific 
Command said this week it is deploying 
20 ships from the docks in 
Hong Kong, Guam, and the island of 
Diego Garcia. The ships are loaded 
with medical equipment and mobile 
hospitals, 41 helicopters, 2,100 Marines, 
1,400 sailors, and the capacity to generate 
600,000 gallons of fresh water 
daily. 

On December 27, the United States 
provided more than 3,000 metric tons of 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H67 

rice to the U.N. World Food Program 
for use in the affected region. The 
United States Department of Defense 
and the United States Agency for 
International Development have established 
regional coordination centers in 
Bangkok, Thailand, and in Colombo, 
Sri Lanka. These centers will help coordinate 
the massive U.S. relief efforts. 

In addition to the hundreds of U.S. 
embassy and USAID mission staff who 
are now dedicated to the response to 
this disaster in their respective countries, 
USAID disaster assistance response 
team members and other U.S. 
assistance team members are already 
on the ground and moving into the affected 
countries. 

Of course, all of us want to advise our 
constituents, what can Americans do? 
Government officials on the ground are 
advising Americans wishing to offer 
support in the relief effort to focus on 
cash donations as opposed to shipments 
of used clothing, canned goods, or 
other commodities. While all assistance 
is greatly appreciated, cash donations 
are proving to be the most helpful 
form of assistance for tsunami victims 
for the following reasons: cash is 
the fastest and most direct way to get 
assistance to specific affected areas 
through nongovernmental and charitable 
organizations that are established 
and respected in the disaster response 
field. The cost of shipping these 
types of goods exceeds the value of the 
goods themselves, and many of these 
goods may not be culturally appropriate 
or timely in their arrival. Cash 
will also be used to help the purchase 
of goods on the ground in the affected 
areas in order to help jump start the 
local economies which were so severely 
impacted by the tsunami. 

At this time, unless there is further 
response and there is, thank goodness, 
from Congressman EHLERS. 

Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I just 
wanted to mention one point which I 
did not include, a very practical point 
for anyone who is in an area that 
might suffer a tsunami. There is a very 
natural warning system that nature 
provides, but it is very short term and 
that is before a tsunami, before the big 
waves roll in, the water recedes, not always, 
but almost always, and that is 
precisely what happened in this case. 
In fact, that killed more people because 
they did not recognize it. Any 
time one is on the coast and you see 
the water receding for some unexplained 
reason, head for high ground. 
That is your first warning. But, in fact, 
what happened, all the fish were left 
stranded on the shore, people rushed 
out, and especially children rushed out 
to grab the fish because obviously they 
need the food and they were out there 
beyond where they should have been 
when the water hit. They had no 
chance of survival whatsoever. 

So there is one good warning system 
every person in every country should 
be aware of, in case you are ever on 
shore, you see the water running out, 
you run in, and head for high ground as 
fast as you can. 

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, we appreciate so 
much the gentleman’s practical advise, 
his expertise, and his obvious compassion 
for the people of south Asia. 

As we conclude, I certainly want to 
say God bless our troops, and we will 
never forget September 11.

Let us bow reverently as we pray. 

Sovereign God, Creator and sustainer 
of us all, our hearts ache for the tsunami 
victims and for all touched by 
this tragedy. In our sadness, our eyes 
turn to You. We confess that we do not 
fully understand why bad things happen 
to good people. Nonetheless, by 
faith, we believe that You can carve 
tunnels of hope through mountains of 
despair. 

Lord, make us Your eyes, ears, feet, 
and hands to bring solace to those who 
suffer. Guide us as we seek to help the 
hurting and empower the global humanitarian 
effort. Comfort those who 
mourn, and strengthen the widows and 
orphans. 

Today, bless our 109th Congress. Give 
our new Senators wisdom and courage 
as You order their steps. Help them 
trust You so completely that Your will 
may be done on Earth. 

We pray this in Your merciful Name. 
Amen.

those who lost their lives and our sincere 
hope that the loved ones left behind 
may heal.

it is so ordered. The Senate

SERVING IN THE SENATE 
Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me 
welcome everyone here and everyone 
watching at home to the Chamber of 
the U.S. Senate and to this historic 
first day of the 109th Congress. 
When the Senate family gathers, it is 
always a special occasion. But this is a 
day when the entire Senate family 
comes together and celebrates this 
unique institution that indeed binds us 
as one. 
So, for being here, I thank the distinguished 
Members of the Senate—past, 
present, and near future—Senate 
friends and our beloved families, and 
our loyal and hardworking Senate 
staff. 
My colleagues, our roots as representatives 
of the people are not recent. 
They are ancient. They reach be


yond the founding of our Republic, to 
our earliest days as colonies. The first 
legislative assembly in the New World 
gathered during the scorching summer 
months of 1619 on Jamestown Island, 
Virginia. Twenty-two burgesses, a governor 
and his council, a clerk, and a 
sergeant of arms met to propose and 
pass ‘‘just laws for the happy guiding 
and governing of the people . . .’’ 

If you visit Jamestown today, you 
can still see the stone foundation of 
the church where that first assembly 
conducted its business. It is on those 
rocks that this House in which we 
stand today was built. 

Over the course of nearly four centuries, 
the seeds of American democracy 
have swept across oceans and over 
mountains and through jungles and 
deserts, taking root in land barren of 
the supposed ‘‘prerequisites’’ for self-
government. These seeds have grown 
into what President Reagan boldly 
called at the height of our war against 
Soviet totalitarianism ‘‘a not-at-all-
fragile flower.’’ 

As U.S. Senators, we, with our colleagues 
in the House and our respected 
President, are the stewards of this ancient 
and yet still living and thriving 
tradition. And this, my friends, is no 
small burden to bear. 

The American people—and indeed the 
people of the world—look upon this 
Capitol and those of us who serve here 
for inspiration and leadership and unwavering 
devotion to our common 
cause. 

So what is expected of us over the 
course of the next 2 years? What is our 
duty as the 100 Members of the world’s 
greatest deliberative body, the U.S. 
Senate? 

We all take the same oath to support 
and defend the same sacred document. 
So, first and foremost, we are obligated—
as individuals, as equals and, 
above all, as a body—to discharge our 
Constitutional duties. 

We also have, as Senator Mike Mansfield 
once said, ‘‘a primary responsibility 
to the people whom [we] represent 
to face the legislative issues of 
the nation.’’ 

And I would add not just the issues of 
today, but the issues of tomorrow. This 
Senate must lead today on tomorrow’s 
challenges. 

Lastly, we have what our longest 
serving Member, ROBERT C. BYRD, calls 
‘‘the duty beyond our duties.’’ It is, as 
he so eloquently and accurately once 
stated: ‘‘The duty to endeavor to inspire 
others and to demonstrate, 
through personal example, that public 
service of all types ought to be an honorable 
calling.’’ 

Senator BYRD, I too believe public 
service is an honorable calling. And, 
my fellow Senators, you are all honorable 
men and women. It is a privilege 
both to serve with you and to serve you 
as majority leader. God bless you, our 
proceedings, the country we love, and 
the people we all aspire to faithfully 
represent. 

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Democratic 
leader is recognized. 

f 

PUBLIC SERVICE 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate 
very much the remarks of the Republican 
leader, and I think there is no 
better example of public service than 
BILL FRIST, a person who, if not the 
most prominent transplant surgeon in 
the country, is one of the most prominent 
transplant surgeons in the country, 
and he decided to become involved 
in public service and he has done it 
very well. 
I repeat, there isn’t a better example 
of public service than the leader. 
When I was less than a week old, my 
father was working in the mine in 
Chloride, AZ. It was a short way over 
the river from Searchlight. He was 
working in a vertical shaft. They were 
sinking a shaft. He was working with 
another man by the name of Carl 
Myers. They drilled holes and set the 
dynamite charges. In those days they 
did not have all the product liability 
protection we have today. 
He lit the 10 fuses. One of them went 
off way before it was supposed to. He 
was hurt very badly. It blew him into 
the air, blew the soles off his shoes. He 
was in a state of shock. He knew he had 
to get out of there because the other 
holes were burning. When they were 
sinking the shaft, they had a 10-foot 
ladder they would bring down, take it 
out when they climbed out of the hole, 
and leave it at the next level. He knew 
he had to get out of there. He put the 
ladder down and it would keep falling. 
He did not realize a leg of the ladder 
had blown off and when he tried to 
climb out, it would fall. 
On the next level was Carl Myers. He 
knew one of the holes went off; he 
knew there were nine others. He did 
something heroic, to say the least. He 
could not stop the other holes from 
going off because they were covered 
with muck at the time, covered with 
dirt. So Carl Myers climbed down. He 
was a smaller man than my dad. My 
dad was 6 feet tall and probably 
weighed 185 pounds. He carried him up 
to the next level and saved his life. As 
soon as he got up there, the holes went 
off. 
I tell this story because the acts of 
one man did much. Among other 
things, it allowed my mother not to be 
a widow, allowed her to have a husband 
and a father for three boys. Later, another 
brother came into the family. 
Carl Myers received a Carnegie medal 
for heroism for what he did to save my 
father’s life. Lowell Thomas wrote 
about this episode involving my father. 
He quoted Carl Myers as saying: To 
hell with the medal, Harry’s alive, isn’t 
he? 
Carl Myers, from the time I was a little 
boy being raised in Searchlight, was 
a hero to me. Because of his decision 
our family was allowed to function. 


S6 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 2005 

Actions of U.S. Senators and the 
President of the Senate have consequences, 
just as Carl’s actions had 
consequences. In the Senate we make 
decisions. We have a lot more time to 
make these decisions than Carl had deciding 
to go back down in the hole. The 
decisions we make touch the lives of 
Americans. People all over America 
are affected by what we do in the Senate. 


The citizens are counting on the Senate 
to make sure public schools are institutions 
that we as Americans are 
proud of. The American people are 
counting on us to make their life better 
by making medical care easier for 
them to come by. People are counting 
on the Senate so a child’s ability to go 
to college will not be determined by 
how much money the parents have. 
People are counting on Congress to 
make sure Social Security is a stable 
fund they can depend on. People are 
counting on Congress to make sure the 
environment is good, so the water we 
drink is pure, the air we breathe is 
good. Women are depending on us. 
They are counting on us to make sure 
their wages are no longer 75 cents of 
every dollar we make as men. There is 
an article in the Washington Post 
today discussing a problem with more 
unintended pregnancies than we anticipated. 
They are depending on us to do 
something about that. Citizens are depending 
on us to make sure our fiscal 
house is in order. They are depending 
on us to do our work in a bipartisan 
fashion to effect change in our country 
to the good. 

I spoke to Senator FRIST this past 
week. We are working on items for 
when we return in late January, items 
we can work on, on a bipartisan basis, 
to show the American people that, yes, 
we can work together. There are issues 
we can work on—maybe the highway 
bill. We did not do it last Congress; 
maybe we can do it this time. There 
are many other issues the leader and I 
talked about. 

There are bipartisan opportunities, 
and I as the new Democratic leader 
speak on behalf of 45 Democratic Senators. 
We are here with our arms open 
to work with the administration, the 
Speaker, the Republican leader, to accomplish 
good for this country. There 
is much we can do that is going to 
make this country a better place. 

Our decisions will affect the American 
people. We should never as a Senate 
forget that what we do has an impact 
on everyone. 

I look forward to this new Congress, 
that we can forget what went on in the 
past, only call upon that which was 
positive in the past and look to the future 
with a greater day, a nicer day, a 
more pleasant day ahead. 

The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader is recognized.

EXPRESSING THE SYMPATHY AND 
PLEDGING SUPPORT OF THE 
UNITED STATES FOR THE VICTIMS 
OF THE TSUNAMI THAT 
STRUCK SOUTH ASIA, SOUTHEAST 
ASIA, AND AFRICA 

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I send a 
resolution to the desk and ask for its 
immediate consideration. 

The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk 
will report the resolution by title. 

The legislative clerk read as follows: 

A resolution (S. Res. 4) expressing the sympathy 
and pledging the support of the United 
States Senate and the people of the United 
States for the victims of the powerful earthquake 
and devastating tsunami that struck 
Bangladesh, Burma, India, Indonesia, Kenya, 
Malaysia, the Maldives, the Seychelles, Somalia, 
Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, and 
other areas of South Asia, Southeast Asia, 
and Africa, on December 26, 2004. 

The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, 
the resolution and its preamble 
are considered and agreed to. 

The resolution (S. Res. 4), with its 
preamble, reads as follows: 
S. RES. 4 

Whereas on December 26, 2004, a tremendous 
earthquake, registered at 9.0 on the 
Richter scale and centered 100 miles off the 
coast of Northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered 
a deadly tsunami that swept throughout 
the Indian Ocean and beyond, devastating 
cities, towns, and communities, and 
killing or injuring persons in Southeast Asia 
and South Asia, through the island nations 
of the region, to Eastern Africa; 

Whereas, as a result of the earthquake and 
ensuing tsunami, more than 140,000 people 
have lost their lives to date, tens of thousands 
of people are injured or missing, and 
the final death toll could climb into the hundreds 
of thousands; 

Whereas the victims also include thousands 
of nationals who were visiting the region 
when the tsunami hit, including significant 
numbers from Europe and North and 
South America; 

Whereas millions of people throughout 
Southeast Asia and South Asia have been 
left without food, shelter, or clean water, 
and now face deadly diseases such as cholera, 
dengue fever, dysentery, malaria, and typhoid; 


Whereas thousands of children have been 
killed or injured, by this disaster; 

Whereas, as a result of this tragedy, thousands 
of children have been separated from 
their families or orphaned and are in need of 
re-unification or adoption; 

Whereas whole coastal communities and 
cities throughout the region were obliterated; 


Whereas recovery, reconstruction, and 
clean-up of the devastated areas likely will 
take years, billions of dollars, and the concerted 
leadership of the United States working 
together with the international community; 


Whereas the people of the United States 
immediately responded and expressed their 
sympathy and concern by sending financial 
aid and other assistance currently totaling 
more than $100,000,000, through nongovernmental 
organizations and other means, to 
the victims of this disaster, and by offering 
to volunteer in the disaster rescue, recovery, 
and rebuilding; 

Whereas soon after the earthquake and 
tsunami hit the region, the United States 


S8 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 2005 

Government expressed its condolences and 
invoked six disaster declarations for the nations 
hardest hit by this natural disaster, 
thus triggering the release of emergency 
funding to these countries; 

Whereas less than 24 hours after these 
tragedies became known, the United States 
announced an initial pledge of $15,000,000 for 
emergency humanitarian assistance, which 
was increased to $35,000,000 in the following 
days as the scope of the tragedy unfolded; 

Whereas President George W. Bush also 
dispatched more than 20 United States military 
cargo and patrol aircraft, redirected a 
Marine expeditionary unit and a carrier task 
force, and deployed several hundred United 
States military personnel to the region to 
assist with the disaster response, recovery, 
and delivery of relief supplies; 

Whereas, in response to an early appeal by 
the International Federation of the Red 
Cross and Red Crescent for $7,500,000, the 
United States provided $4,000,000 for the distribution 
of emergency shelter materials and 
other relief commodities, and provided more 
than 3,000 metric tons of rice to the United 
Nations World Food Program for use in the 
affected region; 

Whereas President George W. Bush has established 
a regional core group with Australia, 
Canada, India, Japan, and the Netherlands, 
with the United Nations, to help coordinate 
relief efforts, and sent a senior delegation 
of experts, led by Secretary of State 
Colin Powell and Florida Governor Jeb Bush, 
to meet with regional leaders and international 
organizations to assess what additional 
aid can be provided by the United 
States; 

Whereas on December 31, 2004, President 
Bush increased the United States pledge to 
$350,000,000 in aid and stated that the United 
States’ contributions to disaster relief and 
recovery ‘‘will continue to be revised as the 
full effects of this terrible tragedy become 
clearer’’; 

Whereas pledges of assistance from all 
international organizations, multilateral development 
banks, and governments, including 
the United States, now exceed 
$2,000,000,000; and 

Whereas, on January 3, 2005, the President 
appointed former Presidents George H. W. 
Bush and Bill Clinton to lead a nationwide 
charitable fund-raising effort to elicit greater 
relief and assistance to the victims of the 
powerful earthquake and devastating tsunami: 
Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) expresses its heartfelt sympathy for the 
victims of the powerful earthquake and devastating 
tsunami that struck cities, towns, 
and communities throughout Southeast 
Asia, South Asia, Eastern Africa, and the region 
on December 26, 2004; 
(2) conveys its most sincere condolences to 
the families, communities, and governments 
of the more than 140,000 people that lost 
their lives in this terrible natural disaster; 
(3) expresses its gratitude and respect for 
the courageous and committed work of all 
aid and relief personnel, including United 
States military personnel, who are saving 
lives and providing relief assistance in the 
devastated areas of the region; 
(4) supports President George W. Bush’s 
pledge of $350,000,000 in direct financial assistance, 
and tens of millions of dollars in 
additional indirect assistance through the 
dispatch of United States military aircraft, 
naval vessels, and personnel, and through 
the United States Government’s substantial 
voluntary and annual contributions to international 
organizations and bodies; 
(5) commends the ongoing international relief 
effort that includes the work of individual 
countries, numerous international organizations, 
and various relief and other 
nongovernmental entities; 

(6) reaffirms that the United States Government 
is committed to providing relief and 
assistance in the most effective and efficient 
means possible, and will continue to assess, 
anticipate, and provide further assistance as 
needed in the weeks and months ahead; 
(7) recognizes that the support of the 
United States Government will be greatly 
supplemented by private donations and assistance 
from thousands of United States 
citizens, charitable organizations, religious 
groups, and corporations that routinely provide 
generous and significant amounts of aid, 
support, and volunteers; and 
(8) fully supports the long-term commitment 
and engagement of the United States 
to provide financial aid and other forms of 
direct and indirect assistance to the countries 
and peoples of the region impacted by 
the powerful earthquake and the devastating 
tsunami. 
Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on the 
morning of December 26, one of the 
worst catastrophes the world has ever 
seen slammed the coast of Southeast 
Asia, South Asia, and eastern Africa. 

Deep in the Indian Ocean, an enormous 
earthquake, estimated at a magnitude 
of 9.0 on the Richter Scale—possibly 
one of the most powerful earthquakes 
ever in history—caused a devastating 
tsunami which has now killed 
over 150,000 people, seriously injuring 
another half a million, and displacing 
as many as 5 million individuals from 
their demolished homes. 

Thousands of people were literally 
washed out to sea as the enormous wall 
of water, traveling at speeds of up to 
500 miles per hour in the open ocean, 
struck the coasts of the Indian Ocean 
Rim. As those waves receded, they 
took with them whole towns and villages. 
They took with them families on 
holiday, fishermen at sea, and children 
who had gone down to the beach that 
morning to play. 

One only begins to comprehend the 
enormity of the tragedy as the individual 
stories emerge, as they have 
over the last several days, such as the 
father who helped his daughter climb 
on to the roof of their hotel and 
drowned in his act of heroism or the 13-
year-old boy who held his grandmother 
afloat as long as he could before she 
succumbed to the waves. 

The tragedy continues for these already 
devastated people. Survivors now 
face the ‘‘disaster after the disaster’’— 
the risk of death from cholera, dysentery, 
malaria, typhoid, and diarrhea, 
all potentially on an epidemic scale. 
The lack of potable water and potential 
emergence of waterborne illnesses pose 
an enormous public health threat. 

In the last week, I have spent hours 
on the phone with ambassadors from 
the affected countries, with senior U.S. 
officials and private citizens, to help 
coordinate some of those relief efforts. 
I am gratified—overwhelmed, in fact— 
by the generosity and commitment so 
many people have shown at every level, 
from local communities to our Government. 
Their outpouring of support and 
concern is truly remarkable. 

One friend of mine, Carl Lindner, has 
a son who is putting together medical 

and relief supplies on a 747 charter to 
India this week. 

Franklin Graham and my friends 
from Samaritan’s Purse are in the field 
right now with assessments and are investing 
heavily through Samaritan’s 
Purse, especially in rural areas that 
are far from airports or far from towns 
or far from those areas we can reach as 
easily. 

Condoleezza Rice and our U.S. officials 
are working tirelessly to coordinate 
our efforts. 

Fred Smith’s company, FedEx, is 
transporting 150,000 pounds of Pedialite 
formula donated by Ross Labs. The 
shipment was loaded onto a FedEx aircraft 
yesterday morning in Columbus, 
Ohio, and should arrive in Sri Lanka 
tomorrow. 

And, of course, the American people 
have shown extraordinary compassion 
and sympathy and empathy. By their 
own initiative, private individuals and 
charities and nongovernment organizations 
and businesses have raised millions 
of dollars to aid the tsunami victims. 
I am filled with admiration for 
the compassion demonstrated by our 
fellow citizens. 

As we return to Congress, we will act 
quickly on a clean tsunami supplemental. 
President Bush announced on 
Friday that America has pledged $350 
million in relief assistance, with $15 
million already speeding toward the 
hands of relief organizations in the affected 
countries. The administration 
will continue to revise this number as 
the full extent of the disaster becomes 
known. 

American military ships, airplanes, 
and helicopters are right now delivering 
food. Over 48 helicopters right 
now are operating, delivering these 
medical supplies and food and water. 
Medicine, tents, water, ladders, food— 
all being delivered through the compassion 
of the international community. 
We have more than 20 patrol and 
cargo aircraft that have been made 
available to assess the disaster and deliver 
relief supplies. Twelve thousand 
of our men and women in uniform are 
working around the clock right now to 
reach survivors in remote corners of 
the region and to participate in the delivery 
of that relief. Evacuation helicopters 
are bringing stranded victims 
to safety. 

The United States has set up a 24-
hour, 7-day-a-week Disaster Response 
Command Center at the U.S. Agency 
for International Development headquarters 
here in Washington, along 
with regional coordination centers in 
Thailand and Sri Lanka. Together with 
governments from around the world, 
America is leading the largest international 
relief effort in history. 

As we speak, a delegation, led by Secretary 
Colin Powell and Governor Jeb 
Bush, is meeting with leaders of the affected 
countries to show America’s 
support and solidarity, and to determine 
how we can continue to be effective, 
to maximize our effectiveness. 

Later tonight I too will travel to the 
region to survey the damage, spending 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S9 

Thursday in Sri Lanka touring disaster 
sites and visiting hospitals, surveying 
our relief efforts, and lending my help 
wherever I can, including medical assistance. 
Following that, I and others 
will travel to the southeast coast of 
India on a similar mission. 

The purpose of our trip is several 
fold: to assure the people of the region 
that we are engaged and fully committed. 
The Senate is taking these 
first steps as an institution by adopting 
the resolution expressing our sympathy 
for the countries and victims affected 
and promising our full support 
of America’s relief efforts. 

While in the region, we will also 
make a personal assessment of what 

U.S. assistance is needed and will have 
the opportunity to meet with leaders of 
the affected countries and ask personally 
how America can best help. I intend 
to ensure that aid is following as 
efficiently and effectively as possible. 
The Senate is taking its first step 
here today as we consider and adopt 
the Senate resolution expressing sympathy 
and pledging support to the victims 
of the earthquake and tsunami 
that struck the peoples of Southeast 
Asia, South Asia, the island nations of 
the region, and eastern Africa. 

Senator REID and I have worked 
closely on this effort in a bipartisan 
manner to express the unanimous 
agreement of this body, the U.S. Senate. 


I also thank Senator DICK LUGAR, 
who has shown steadfast leadership in 
this time of crisis and who has worked 
closely on this resolution with us as 
well. I know his committee in the coming 
weeks and months ahead will be 
delving into many matters relating to 
this disaster. We extend our great 
thanks to him. 

Let me close my remarks by offering, 
on behalf of myself, the U.S. Senate, 
and the American people, our deepest 
sympathies to the victims of this terrible 
tragedy. 

Our hearts and prayers are with 
you—the victims, the survivors, and 
their families. The struggle to recover 
will be long. We all know that. It will 
be difficult. There will be many sorrow-
filled days as we learn the full impact 
of this tragedy, but throughout the 
United States will stand shoulder to 
shoulder with the people of these devastated 
lands. We are determined to 
help rebuild their communities and restore 
their hope. 

America is a great nation because it 
is a compassionate nation. It is our solemn 
commitment and obligation as a 
free people to share the blessing of liberty, 
especially with those who are so 
desperately in need. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Nevada. 

Mr. REID. Mr. President, the day 
after the tsunami, I had the opportunity 
to meet with scores of people 
from Southeast Asia. There were people 
from Sri Lanka. The person who 
put the event together was from Ban


gladesh. We had people from Thailand, 
India, many people. It was an event in 
my honor. They had bought out a restaurant 
that night. It was a festive occasion, 
but there was a pall over what 
we were doing as a result of the tsunami 
that had taken place. 

This tsunami was so difficult. These 
people in Reno, NV, had come to our 
country for the opportunity to realize 
their hopes and dreams. Each one of 
them love America, but of course they 
also feel an abiding love for their native 
lands and cultures. 

I have trouble comprehending the 
power of nature. I read that the earthquake 
that took place was a million 
times more powerful than the bomb 
dropped on Nagasaki—not one thousand 
times, a million times. It was so 
powerful it threw off the Earth’s rotation. 
This was a powerful act of nature. 

In today’s world, there is no such 
thing as an isolated event. It hit 11 
countries. We are all connected to 
those countries. One hundred or so 
years ago that wouldn’t have been the 
case. Fifty years ago it would have 
been less the case. The earthquake that 
caused the deadly tsunami was estimated 
at 9.0 on the Richter Scale. It 
was first picked up in Hawaii. They 
thought it was 8.0. I thought to myself, 
8, 9, is that a big difference? It is 100 
times different. 

The President pro tempore is from 
Alaska. It is my understanding that 
the only earthquake in recent history 
that was stronger took place in Alaska. 
Fortunately, there were not a lot of 
people in Alaska and there wasn’t the 
deadly tsunami that occurred following 
that earthquake. 

We don’t know the death toll. They 
found 6,000 more dead people yesterday, 
9 or 10 days after the event. It is probably 
150,000 and counting. Tens of thousands 
of people are missing. Millions 
have lost their homes. We are all affected 
by this catastrophic loss. We all 
share the anguish of a mother who lost 
a child, a father who lost a child. We 
feel the bewilderment and fear of children 
who lost their parents. That is 
why I am happy this resolution contains 
a paragraph dealing with adoption. 


We all want to help. Since this tragedy 
took place 9 days ago, the world 
has seen an outpouring of aid for the 
victims of this tsunami. I spoke with 
the Democratic ranking member on the 
Finance Committee. He also has to 
deal with Senator GRASSLEY, the chairman. 
They are concerned that the outpouring 
of charity by the people of the 
United States will be recognized 
taxwise. We need to do that so they can 
get some benefit for the money they 
gave before the end of the year. I hope 
we can. 

The American people have opened 
their hearts and wallets, donating millions 
of dollars to groups such as the 
Red Cross that are working to provide 
relief from this disaster. Two former 
Presidents with whom I had the good 
fortune of serving in the Congress, Bill 

Clinton and George Bush the first, have 
agreed to lead the charitable efforts for 
the United States. 

We got off to a slow start. There is no 
question about that. At the event I 
talked about in Reno, we talked about 
Secretary Powell’s press conference 
where he said we were going to provide 
$15 million. We were all terribly disappointed 
in that. I hoped that the Secretary 
didn’t realize the full impact of 
the tragedy that had taken place. I 
couldn’t imagine he would have done 
that had he known. Fifteen million is 
half as much as we are spending on the 
inaugural ceremonies this month. And 
then it took a while for the President 
to step forward. Let’s put all that behind 
us. America has now stepped forward. 
I am proud of what we have done 
and what we are doing. We have a lot 
more to do. 

I was glad to see the U.S. military, as 
stretched as we are, step forward with 
aircraft carriers and other resources 
that only the military can put forward. 
I listened to something on Public 
Radio today. It said that on one island 
in Indonesia, they had instructed the 
American helicopter pilots not to bring 
in any more wounded: People who are 
sick, we cannot take care of them. The 
American pilots brought them in anyway. 
As a result of that, the American 
military responded by setting up a field 
hospital that will take care of those 
people. We are doing a lot. We have 
more to do. 

The magnitude of the disaster that 
befell this part of the world is unbelievable 
to most of us. I am glad that 
America is now responding. That is 
why this resolution is so important. We 
have increased our commitment. I have 
already talked about the aircraft, the 
ships, the helicopters that deliver the 
food and water and clothing. One of 
those aircraft carriers makes thousands 
and thousands of gallons of pure, 
fresh water every day. That will be 
taken off the aircraft carrier to people 
who have despoiled water, water that is 
contaminated. 

The response of the American people 
and our Government is important for 
many reasons. Obviously, our efforts 
help relieve the suffering of these victims, 
but they also help show the world 
what kind of a nation and people we 
are. David Ignatius wrote a wonderful 
column in the Washington Post where 
he talked about our ability to respond 
to world situations when there is such 
a disaster. We are not going to be able 
to win the war against terror unless we 
are able to show the world that we are 
a country based upon laws, not men, 
that we are a charitable nation, that 
we are a nation that is concerned about 
people’s rights, human rights. 

If we are able to show by virtue of 
the example we are setting with the 
disaster that befell these 11 nations, we 
will be able to convert people who are 
sympathetic to evil terrorists. We have 
a lot of people who are sympathetic to 
what these evil terrorists are doing. 
With actions such as this, we will be 


S10 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 2005 

able to show to those people who are 
sympathetic to the terrorists that 
maybe their sympathy is not well 
placed. I am confident we can do that, 
and in the process we will win the war 
on terror that is being perpetrated 
against not only us but against the 
world. 

I commend and applaud the majority 
leader for working to make the resolution 
the first order of legislative business 
in this session of Congress. It is 
important that we do that. Again, I appreciate 
the opportunity to speak. 

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the tidal 
waves, tsunamis, that traversed the Indian 
Ocean and the Western Pacific on 
December 26 have caused death and destruction 
in at least 12 countries, particularly 
India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka 
and Thailand. The tsunami disaster 
constitutes a humanitarian tragedy of 
incredible proportions. Currently, experts 
estimate that more than 150,000 
people have perished and countless people 
are injured. Millions are homeless 
and at risk from disease. These tragic 
numbers are expected to rise as we obtain 
additional information. 

The United States is a compassionate 
country that will respond generously 
to this human catastrophe. Under the 
leadership of President Bush, the agencies 
and resources of the U.S. Government 
have been mobilized to assist in 
the initial humanitarian effort. In addition, 
innumerable individual Americans 
and U.S. businesses have donated 
millions of dollars directly to international 
relief efforts. As the world 
leader in international disaster assistance, 
the United States must work 
closely with the international community 
to implement the most effective 
response possible in the coming weeks 
and months. 

Beyond the compelling humanitarian 
reasons for swift action, a stable and 
prosperous Asia is essential to the 
global effort on a range of shared problems, 
including weapons proliferation, 
terrorism, narcotics, and contagious 
diseases. The worldwide economic and 
political consequences of this natural 
disaster could be even more severe unless 
we commit ourselves to advancing 
a strong recovery in the region. 

This resolution explains the gravity 
of the situation, offers condolences to 
the victims and their loved ones, and 
sets the stage for Congress to make additional 
appropriations that will aid in 
the recovery. Congress must work with 
the President for a generous supplemental 
appropriation that goes well beyond 
the amounts of money already 
committed. 

A summit pledging conference is 
scheduled to occur in Jakarta, Indonesia 
on Thursday. The United States 
should be there in a leadership position. 
This will be an important opportunity 
to work with the world community 
in responding to this tragedy. 
American humanitarian, diplomatic, 
and national security interests will be 
deeply affected by the outcome of this 
conference. 

My heart goes out to the victims of 
this tragedy. While financial and in-
kind assistance cannot replace the 
huge loss of life that countries in the 
region have suffered, the United 
States’ contribution will, at least, help 
the survivors rebuild their lives. 

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I express 
my sincere sympathy for the millions 
of people affected by the devastating 
earthquake and tsunami that 
struck Southeast Asia, South Asia, and 
East Africa on December 26. The scale 
of this disaster is overwhelming, and 
the human losses are horrifying. Families 
have been shattered and whole 
communities lost, and because so many 
international tourists were in the region, 
virtually every part of the 
world—including the United States—is 
represented in the list of casualties. 

I know the sorrow that I feel as I review 
the reports of devastating losses 
is shared by the people of Wisconsin 
and by all Americans. I know that we 
also share a sense of resolve—resolve to 
provide whatever assistance we can to 
the survivors and the affected communities, 
and resolve to be steadfast partners 
in the long-term reconstruction 
efforts that must follow the relief operations. 


I vividly recall the powerful voices 
that rose up from all corners of the 
globe in the wake of the terrorist attacks 
of September 11, 2001. I remember 
how they conveyed a sense of solidarity 
and support that gave our country 
comfort and affirmed the bonds that 
unite all of humanity, regardless of nationality, 
ethnicity, or religion. Now, 
countless American voices are also 
sounding loudly and clearly in that 
same spirit. 

I am grateful for the efforts of so 
many around the world to come to the 
aid of those in need, including U.S. 
military personnel who are working 
day and night to help. Businesses and 
individuals from around Wisconsin 
have contacted my office, looking for 
ways that they can help. I am proud to 
be a cosponsor of the resolution before 
the Senate that expresses our sympathy 
and pledges our support to the 
victims of this catastrophe, and I 
pledge to continue working with my 
colleagues to ensure that our words 
continue to be matched by our actions. 

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, 
today the Senate expresses its condolences 
over the recent tsunami disaster. 
Like most Americans, I watched 
in horror over the holidays as a tsunami 
battered thousands of miles of 
coastline across South Asia and Africa. 
The damage left in the wake of this 
disaster is almost overwhelming, and I 
feel a sense of personal and professional 
obligation to do whatever can be 
done to help those in need. Though the 
grim reports have varied in the days 
following this disaster, it is becoming 
clear that nearly 150,000 people have already 
lost their lives, and hundreds of 
thousands of others are in grave jeopardy 
because of the damage inflicted 
by the tsunami. Still more families are 

searching for loved ones, hoping for 
any news regarding their family members’ 
whereabouts. 

In trying to guide a humanitarian effort 
through the aftermath of this 
tragedy, the United States and the 
larger international community must 
help these countries face longer term 
obstacles of disease, the destruction of 
basic infrastructure, complete damage 
to coastal economies and other fundamental 
hardship. America has itself 
been the victim of great tragedies such 
as this, and indeed it appears that 
thousands of Americans living or traveling 
in South Asia and Africa have 
themselves been affected by this horrible 
natural disaster. 

My heart goes out to all these victims 
of the tsunami. It is time for the 
world, particularly those nations that 
are most fortunate such as the United 
States, to move rapidly with a relief 
and recovery effort that is worthy of 
the size of this tragedy. I am encouraged 
that our Government, in cooperation 
with private sector charities and 
the business community, has now 
begun to focus on what can be done to 
help the affected countries. This tragedy 
provides America with an opportunity 
to show that we can lead the 
world, not just when it is our military 
that is needed, but when we can offer 
our generosity and expertise for a massive 
humanitarian effort. So many nations 
affected by this tragedy are looking 
to America for help and we have an 
opportunity to provide the world our 
leadership. In addition to it being the 
right thing to do, it is clearly in America’s 
national interest to be a leader in 
helping these countries to recover. 

In this spirit, I wholeheartedly support 
the administration’s pledge of $350 
million to the relief effort. I also commend 
the involvement of former Presidents 
Clinton and Bush in helping to 
organize a private relief effort. I would 
also like to commend the work being 
done by our private sector, particularly 
by nongovernmental organizations and 
the business community, to help those 
in need. This charitable work is 
quintessentially American, and these 
efforts are something for which we can 
all be proud. 

I also want to share with my colleagues 
that we should be aware that 
the generosity of the American people 
in response to this disaster extends to 
the knowledge we have to share with 
the world regarding the monitoring 
and reporting of oceanic and climatic 
events. 

There is important research and 
monitoring already being done by the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
on tsunami events, work 
that involves the University of Washington 
in my State. Scientists are 
learning how better to monitor patterns 
or impending developments in 
our oceans so we can be prepared for 
future possible events. We do not always 
focus on the good work being 
done by NOAA, until something tragic 
like this tsunami occurs. Congress has 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S11 

an obligation to people on our coasts to 
fund NOAA and see that it can do its 
job well, and we should work to fulfill 
that obligation. 

In the United States, NOAA’s National 
Weather Service operates two 
tsunami warning centers, the Pacific 
Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii and 
the West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning 
Center in Alaska. In the event of a 
tsunami, the Centers will issue local 
tsunami advisories to the Emergency 
Managers Office of each potentially affected 
State. The decision to evacuate 
a coastal area rests with each responsible 
EM. The Seattle Post Intelligencer 
reported that the current U.S. 
network consists of six deep-sea sensors 
in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, 
Hawaii, and near the equator off the 
coast of Peru. In addition to the six 
tsunami buoys, the warning system 
takes advantage of existing tidal monitoring 
stations and USGS seismic monitoring 
and reporting capabilities. The 
NOAA official in charge of the system 
described the current configuration as 
the ‘‘bare minimum’’ needed for adequate 
warning. There are plans to expand 
the system to 20 tsunami buoys in 
the next five years, 10 of which will be 
placed in the Aleutian Islands. NOAA 
is estimating one-time costs of $8.7 
million and recurring costs of $8.5 million 
to enhance the current system. 

NOAA also runs a Tsunami Research 
Program out of the Pacific Marine Environmental 
Laboratory in Seattle. 
The objective of the Tsunami Research 
Program is to improve warning guidance, 
hazard assessment, and implementation 
planning. The Joint Institute 
for the Study of the Atmosphere 
and Ocean, a partnership between 
NOAA and UW, has also worked with 
the Tsunami Research Program on hazard 
assessment modeling. 

PMEL has also developed instruments 
it has named tsunameters. With 
six deployed in the middle of the Pacific 
since 2001 in waters 2.5 to 4 miles 
deep, the tsunameters can detect the 
perturbations in water pressure as a 
tsunami passes above. When it detects 
something, it sends a signal by sound 
waves to a buoy on the surface. The 
signal is relayed to a satellite and then 
back to Earth to tsunami warning centers 
in Hawaii and Alaska, a process 
that takes only 2 minutes. 

No significant tsunamis have yet occurred 
in the Pacific for the 
tsunameters to detect, but they have 
prevented a false alarm. In November 
2003, a magnitude 7.8 undersea earthquake 
occurred near the Aleutian Islands, 
spurring officials to issue a tsunami 
warning. When the wave passed 
over a tsunameter, they saw it was 
small and canceled the warning. 

In conclusion, I again express my 
condolences and those of Washingtonians 
to those who have lost family 
members in this tragedy. The Senate 
should do all it can to help all those 
who face a long and difficult cleanup. 

Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish 
to express my profound condolences for 

the victims of the earthquake and tsunami 
in Southeast Asia, South Asia, 
and Africa. I commend our two leaders 
for writing S. Res. 4, passed unanimously 
by the Senate earlier this 
afternoon. It is right and fitting that 
on our first day of business in this Congress 
the Senate has united to send a 
message of hope and leadership to the 
victims of this horrible disaster. 

We were all mortified to learn of the 
devastation caused by this disaster as 
we awoke after a day of Christmas 
celebrations. The news from this disaster 
has been arriving so fast and furious 
that it is hard to put the kinds of 
numbers we are talking about in perspective. 
We know there are more than 
150,000 people dead—that is 150,000 personal 
tragedies. And there are hundreds 
of thousands of others who are 
homeless and whose lives have been 
turned upside down by this tragedy. We 
said clearly to their families and loved 
ones in our resolution today that we 
are here to help them recover and rebuild. 


The generosity and compassion of 
America will be felt in Bangladesh, 
Burma, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, 
Maldives, Seychelles, Somalia, 
Sri Lanka, Tanzania, and Thailand. In 
fact, our troops and humanitarian assistance 
professionals are already 
bringing hope to those countries in the 
form of water, food and comfort. We 
thank our troops for their hard work 
and for showing the world the best of 
America, as they always do. 

I am also mindful this afternoon that 
this terrible disaster has wreaked 
havoc in our own country and in my 
own state of Colorado. My thoughts 
and prayers go out to all the victims 
and their families.

TRIBUTE TO MONSIGNOR 
IGNATIUS MCDERMOTT 

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is 
with sadness that I rise to pay tribute 

to the life of a great friend, a great 
man who passed away on December 31. 
His name was Monsignor Ignatius 
McDermott and he was known as Father 
Mac, from the city of Chicago. He 
was a model of compassion, commitment, 
and service. 

On December 31, when he left this 
Earth, he was 95 years old. He made his 
name in Chicago because of his dedication 
to some of the poorest people who 
lived in that city. When he was a young 
priest, he had many options. He worked 
in parishes and had different assignments, 
but he knew there was a special 
calling in his life, a calling that very 
few priests, very few people would even 
consider. Monsignor McDermott, Father 
Mac, dedicated his life to walking 
Chicago’s meanest streets, skid row, 
and becoming the priest, the chaplain, 
of thousands of people on those streets 
addicted to drugs and alcohol. 

Ironically, he died on the 29th anniversary 
of the day that he cofounded 
Chicago’s largest addiction treatment 
center, Haymarket Center. 

He was born in the ‘‘Back of the 
Yards’’ neighborhood. If you read 
Upton Sinclair’s book ‘‘The Jungle,’’ 
you know what the stockyards meant 
to the city of Chicago. That is where 
the immigrant families headed. That is 
where they could find a job that required 
hard work and a strong back 
and barely make a living. That is 
where he grew up. 

He was known in his youth as just 
the kid brother of the famous alderman, 
Jim McDermott. He was ordained 
to the priesthood in 1936. He was assigned 
to what is now known in Chicago 
as Maryville Academy, a home for 
neglected and abandoned orphaned 
children. It was there that he saw for 
the first time in his ministry how alcoholism 
affected families. 

He disagreed with the common sentiment 
in Chicago and across the country 
that alcoholism was just a character 
flaw: If you had a little better 
character, you might overcome that 
problem. He understood it was a disease 
and it needed to be treated. So Father 
McDermott brought Alcoholics 
Anonymous, which in the late forties 
was really a creation for the middle 
class of America, to the people of skid 
row in Chicago, people whose alcoholism 
had left them in the worst possible 
plight. 

In 1963, he founded the Central States 
Institute of Addiction because he recognized 
the need for qualified treatment 
counselors and educators. It was 
there that Illinois’s first program for 
offenders convicted of driving under 
the influence of alcohol was created. 

In the 1970s, he led the charge in our 
State to decriminalize public drunkenness. 
On New Year’s Eve 1975, along 
with Dr. James West, who would go on 
to direct the Betty Ford Center in California, 
Father McDermott founded 
Haymarket Center. 

I have had the privilege in public life 
to meet some amazing people, and I 
count Monsignor McDermott—Father 
Mac—as one of those people. 


S12 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 2005 

When I first came to the Senate, the 
Irish-American clubs of Chicago came 
to me and suggested we should have a 
postage stamp that would acknowledge 
the contribution of Irish immigrants to 
America. I was surprised it had never 
happened. So the first phone call I 
made in the Senate was to my colleague, 
Senator TED KENNEDY. If there 
is anything dealing with Irish Americans, 
you better get TED KENNEDY on 
board. He thought it was a great idea. 
So we worked together, and we were 
successful. 

The Postal Commission decided to 
commission a commemorative stamp 
commemorating the immigration of 
the Irish to Chicago. TED and I tried to 
decide which one of us would announce 
the stamp. By seniority, he was able to 
announce the first-day issue in Boston, 
the same day I would unveil the stamp 
in Chicago. 

I thought to myself: Who will I invite 
from this city of so many great Irish 
Americans to come and represent those 
of that ethnic origin at the unveiling of 
the stamp? I looked around at some of 
the obvious: Father John Smith of 
Maryville, the institution I mentioned 
earlier, who did so much to help so 
many young children; Sister Rosemary 
of Misericordia Center, just an amazing, 
wonderful, and warm, touching 
center for children who were born with 
mental affliction and mental illness. I 
thought of Father Jim Close, who runs 
Mercy Home for boys and girls in Chicago. 
I thought what a great contribution 
he made. I thought of my pastor 
from my parish, Father Jack Wall from 
old Saint Pat’s, a downtown parish 
that serves so many people in that 
community. But I also thought of Father 
Mac. 

I brought them all together. They 
were up there with me on that stage 
when we unveiled the stamp. When I 
got up, I said: If you want to know the 
contribution of the Irish people to the 
city of Chicago, look at these five people 
and the dedication of their lives 
and what they have done to help so 
many people. Had the Irish been pushed 
away and shunned from coming to 
America, would someone else have 
stepped into their roles? 

I thought about that again when Father 
Mac passed away. He took an assignment 
most priests would not even 
consider: going to those mean streets, 
those poor areas of Chicago. That was 
his ministry. How many times would 
each one of us, as we are walking along 
with our family on the street, see 
someone who is obviously intoxicated 
or sick with addiction and maybe pick 
up our pace and walk a little faster? 
For Father Mac, that is exactly when 
he would slow down and stop to try to 
determine what he could do. 

He dedicated his life to these people. 
There were so many amazing stories 
that came from it, lives that were 
saved, people who were given a chance 
to succeed. When he opened the 
Haymarket Center—it is right behind 
Greek Town in Chicago, if you happen 

to know the city a little bit. It used to 
be a part of the city that mainly was 
warehouses. Now it is becoming pretty 
gentrified with a lot of lofts and condominiums, 
with a lot of people moving 
in, a lot of trendy restaurants, but 
when it was one of the poorest parts of 
Chicago, Father Mac established 
Haymarket Center because that is 
where he could find the people who 
needed his help. 

I have been there several times. He 
had a little chapel in Haymarket where 
he would hold mass on Sundays, and 
many people came to join him at that 
little service. As they walked around 
Haymarket Center, they understood 
that even though those were some of 
the poorest people in some of the worst 
places in our city, Father Mac always 
treated them as his brothers and sisters. 
He went out of his way to give 
them the dignity and attention they 
deserved. 

Those of us who were privileged to 
have known Father Mac will remember 
his wonderful ability to always see 
good in people and to convince those 
same people not to give up on themselves. 
He was a visionary, he was a 
leader, and he was a friend. But he was 
more. When I think back on my life, on 
those I have met who made a profound 
impression on me and who if they did 
not reach the level of sainthood were 
knocking at the door, Father Mac was 
one of those people. 

I extend my deepest condolences to 
all of those who join me in treasuring 
the fond memories of Monsignor Ignatius 
McDermott. We start the new year 
with a heavy heart but with a renewed 
commitment that each of us in some 
small way will try to continue the ministry 
of this wonderful man. 

I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
SUNUNU). The clerk will call the roll. 

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
CORNYN). Without objection, it is so ordered. 


f 

ASBESTOS LEGISLATION 
Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have 
sought recognition to discuss briefly 
the status of efforts to have asbestos 
tort reform legislation, a matter which 
has been before the Congress of the 
United States for more than two decades. 
I had my first contact with the issue 
back in 1984 when then-Senator Gary 
Hart of Colorado brought in a constituent 
to talk about asbestos. It has 
been an issue which we have labored 
with long and hard, and in the last 
Congress, Senator HATCH, Chairman of 
the Judiciary Committee, advanced 
legislation with the concept of a trust 
and a schedule of payments to avoid 
the costs and risks of litigation and to 

treat asbestos injuries very much like 
workers’ compensation. 

A bill was passed out of the Judiciary 
Committee last July, pretty much on a 
party-line vote, as the distinguished 
Presiding Officer, Senator CORNYN of 
Texas, knows because he was and is on 
the Judiciary Committee and did a prodigious 
amount of work on this issue. 
The bill was passed out with a number 
of problems. I voted for it to move it 
along. I then enlisted the assistance of 
the former Chief Judge of the Court of 
Appeals for the Third Circuit, Edward 

R. Becker, who was in senior status. 
Judge Becker convened a large group of 
so-called stakeholders in his chamber. 
For two full days in August, he met in 
his chambers with representatives of 
the manufacturers, representatives of 
the AFL–CIO, representatives of the insurance 
industry, the reinsurance industry, 
and trial lawyers to start to 
work through a large number of problems 
which appeared to be intractable. 
We have worked through many of those 
problems, but some still remain. 
There had been some talk about a 
draft bill being offered, but it is not appropriate 
to offer legislation until 
later this month under the procedures 
established by the majority leader, and 
the proposed draft legislation is not 
quite ready, although a great deal of 
work has been done on it. 

There have been major issues raised 
as to what the total amount of the 
trust fund should be. There have been 
issues raised as to how much money 
should be in the startup fund; how long 
the trust fund ought to function before 
giving the claimants the right to revert 
to the judicial system because the 
legislation necessarily takes away 
their right to jury trial in consideration 
of a certain amount of money to 
be paid under the trust fund; and the 
problems that many victims are having 
where they are unable to collect from 
anyone—people with mesothelioma, a 
deadly disease, with cancer, with many 
ailments from the exposure to asbestos. 


This would be the offset to giving up 
the right to a jury trial. 

We have adopted an approach of reverting 
back to the right to jury trial 
if the elaborate system does not work. 
I think the system is realistically calculated 
to be successful. 

Following the meetings in Judge 
Becker’s chambers last August, there 
have been some 32 sessions held in my 
conference room, presided over by 
Judge Becker with myself in attendance 
for most of those meetings. 

To repeat, a lot of progress has been 
made. It is my hope to be able to circulate 
a draft bill as a vehicle for discussion. 
I call it a discussion draft bill. 
My hope is that it could be circulated 
before the end of the week, but it is not 
possible to make any firm commitments 
because candidly every time we 
come upon a sequence of negotiations, 
other problems arise. If there is any 
way to reconcile them and to have a 
consensus before going into print, we 
are trying to do that. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S13 

It had been my hope last year, as we 
worked through the process, to have a 
bill by consensus. Senator FRIST and 
the then-Democratic leader, Senator 
DASCHLE, did a great deal of work and 
exchanged letters. At one point we 
thought we were on the verge of a consensus, 
but it did not work out. 

In order to pass a bill, as we all 
know, in the last stages of a legislative 
session, it has to be by consensus because 
any single Senator can hold up a 
bill in its final stages. That consensus 
was not possible, and although we were 
very close on many issues, there are 
some issues where there is still some 
difference of opinion. The differences 
have been narrowed, and we have come 
a long way. 

It is my hope to circulate a draft discussion 
bill, and there likely will still 
be some blanks. We will fill in as many 
of the blanks as we can, and then 
Judge Becker and I will be available to 
meet with the stakeholders in my conference 
room on Monday to talk about 
the areas where there has been agreement, 
to talk about the specifics on a 
draft discussion bill, and to talk about 
the areas where there are still differences 
as to how we might bridge 
that gap. 

I have worked with Senator LEAHY. I 
commend him for his work with Chairman 
HATCH on this matter. We have 
talked about having a hearing next 
Tuesday on January 11. I am not unaware 
of the fact that it is not a convenient 
time, but Senator LEAHY will 
be present and I think there will be 
some other Senators present. We have 
given several weeks notice. We are 
aware it is a difficult time, but there 
are many hearings held in the Senate 
with just a few Senators, the chairman, 
and the ranking member present. I 
think it is important to move ahead. 

At that time, it is the expectation 
that we will hear testimony from 
Judge Becker to lay out the draft discussion 
bill and then to hear testimony 
from the stakeholders identifying the 
parts of the bill which they choose to 
comment about where there are agreements 
or where there are disagreements. 
We know from experience that 
the early part of a legislative session is 
necessarily slow, but that early on in 
February, certainly in March, sometimes 
by mid-February, we begin to 
move ahead and the calendar begins to 
be crowded. 

There are many items which the 
President has identified as legislative 
priorities. We will have confirmation 
hearings starting with White House 
Counsel Gonzales on Thursday and 
there will be other confirmation hearings. 
So it is my hope to be able to 
present a bill through markup at a 
very early date. Whether that can be 
done in late January or early February, 
frankly, remains to be seen. 

When we marked up this bill the last 
Thursday of July of 2003, it was a very 
long markup. It lasted more than 12 
hours, as the distinguished Presiding 
Officer will recollect. In a sense, we 

had the longest markup in the history 
of the Senate with the sessions in 
Judge Becker’s chambers and the 32 
sessions in my conference room. I 
thought it would be useful to briefly 
describe where we have been and in a 
sense where we are going so our colleagues 
will know what the status is as 
fully as it can be described without actually 
circulating a draft discussion of 
the bill, which will be done at the earliest 
possible time. 

I thank the Chair. I commend him for 
his lonely vigil. This was a thriving 
Chamber three hours ago with standing 
room only and suddenly the business of 
the Senate is not quite so pressing with 
only the Presiding Officer and this Senator 
present. So in the absence of any 
other Senator, I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The assistant legislative clerk proceeded 
to call the roll. 

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
CRAPO). Without objection, it is so ordered. 


Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
speak for as much time as I consume. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

f 

DELIVERING SOLUTIONS TO THE 
NATION’S PROBLEMS 

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would 
like to take a few minutes to expand 
on what I discussed at the outset of 
this session, now about 3 hours ago. I 
would like to focus not just on what we 
must do as individual Senators, but 
also on what this Senate can do and 
can achieve together, as a body. With 
the President and the House as partners, 
we can deliver meaningful solutions 
to the real problems that confront 
our Nation. We can secure freedom 
and safety and a healthier future 
for generations of Americans to come. 

We made much progress toward these 
goals in the last Congress and we did so 
in a very narrowly divided Senate. 
Even with the rough and tumble of 
election year politics, we found ways to 
work together for the common good of 
our country. We can, we must, and I believe 
we will achieve at least the same 
and hopefully even greater success in 
the Senate. 

No doubt it will be a challenge. The 
makeup of this Senate is unique. The 
margins between the majority and the 
minority may be wider, but the margins 
at the ends of the ideological spectrum 
are wider still. 

We also have our own prerogatives as 
equals, as individual Senators, as members 
of our respective caucuses. And we 
have principles, principles to which I 
hope each and every one of us will hold 
tight during the next 2 years and 
throughout our careers in public service. 
But we also have an obligation to 

this body and to the people and to the 
Nation we serve to conduct that business 
with civility and with foresight 
and a sharp focus on those meaningful 
solutions. The agenda before us is simply 
too ambitious, too urgent, and too 
important to the future of our country 
and the world to do otherwise. Every 
Member of this body can take pride in 
the accomplishments of the last Congress, 
the 108th Congress. We took on 
big issues. We took on huge challenges. 
And our actions translated into solutions. 
Together we proudly moved 
America forward. 

For years Congress talked about providing 
seniors with relief from the skyrocketing 
cost of prescription drugs 
through Medicare. Finally, in 2003, 
Congress took action and passed the 
first substantial improvement to Medicare 
since the program was created 40 
years ago. Today, more than 6 million 
seniors have prescription drug discount 
cards that are saving them 10 percent 
to 25 percent on their medicines; tens 
of thousands more are signing up every 
week; and within 12 months every senior 
on Medicare will have affordable access 
to a comprehensive prescription 
drug benefit. Challenge; action; solutions. 


Before President Bush took office, 
our economy was tilting toward recession. 
Then the Internet bubble burst, 
corporate scandals rattled investor 
confidence, and terrorist attacks devastated 
our economy. We took action. 
We cut taxes for every American who 
pays taxes and we reduced taxes on 
businesses, helping them invest and expand 
and be more competitive in the 
global economy. Since August 2003, our 
businesses have created over 2.4 million 
jobs, we reduced the unemployment 
rate from a peak of 6.3 percent last 
June to 5.4 percent today, and aftertax 
income is up by more than 10 percent 
since 2000. Challenge; action; solutions. 

On September 11, 2001, the United 
States was ruthlessly and brutally attacked 
by terrorists. More than 3,000 
innocent men, women, and children 
were murdered. America and indeed the 
world changed forever. I am proud of 
the support this body has given to our 
Commander in Chief and the brave men 
and women who risk their lives every 
day to defend our country. We provided 
$87 billion to help our military buy 
equipment and support operations in 
Afghanistan and Iraq. To date, our 
forces have killed or captured three 
quarters of al Qaida’s leadership. They 
have toppled two terrorist regimes, and 
in the process they have liberated 50 
million people and put them on the 
path to self-government. 

The Senate also adopted the most 
sweeping overhaul of our intelligence 
system since the creation of the CIA 
itself. This will bolster and better organize 
our intelligence efforts to win the 
war on terror and face those new security 
threats of the 21st century. Again: 
Challenge; action; solutions. 

These are just several of the achievements 
of the last Congress. But the 


S14 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 2005 

pattern that has been set is clear. 
America faced urgent challenges. We 
acted with solutions, and with the 
heart and drive and genius of our people 
we moved America forward. 

Earlier today we witnessed 34 Members 
take that oath of office of a U.S. 
Senator. It is a wonderful tradition 
that dates back to that first Congress 
in 1789. The oath at that time was a 
simple 14–word phrase: 

I do solemnly affirm that I will support the 
Constitution of the United States. 

Those same 14 words form the vital 
core of today’s oath, the oath that 34 
Senators took now 3 hours ago. They 
bind us and all who have served in this 
body before us, many of whom joined 
us today, to a common, a timeless, and 
a paramount cause. 

Our first responsibility above all else 
is to do our constitutional duty. Nothing 
should come before it. Nothing 
should stand between it—not party, not 
ideology, and certainly not politics. 

Yet, in the last Congress I believe the 
Senate failed to perform an essential 
constitutional duty. It failed to offer 
advice and consent to the President by 
filibustering ten judicial nominees and 
threatening to filibuster another six. 
These filibusters were unprecedented. 
Never in the history of the Senate has 
a minority filibustered a judicial nominee 
who had clear majority support. 
This was an abrupt and an unfortunate 
break in more than 200 years of Senate 
tradition, of Senate history. This tradition 
must be restored, not merely because 
we honor the traditions of the 
Senate, but because this tradition reflects 
the proper role for this body, the 
Senate, as designed by our Framers in 
the constitutional arrangement. 

Next month we will have the opportunity 
to restore Senate tradition. I 
will bring one of the President’s very 
capable, qualified, and experienced judicial 
nominees to the floor. We can debate 
that nomination. We can vote to 
support it or to oppose it. And we must 
offer the President advice and consent 
by giving this and future judicial nominees 
who are brought to the floor up-
or-down votes. 

Some, I know, have suggested that 
the filibusters of the last Congress are 
reason enough to offer a procedural 
change today, right here and right 
now, but at this moment I do not 
choose that path. 

Democratic colleagues have new 
leadership. And in the spirit of bipartisanship, 
I want to extend my hand 
across the aisle. 

I have a sincere hope that we can 
move forward past difficulties—beyond 
the past difficulties we saw in the last 
Congress—and look forward to a future 
of cooperation. 

I seek cooperation, not confrontation. 
Cooperation does not require support 
for the nominees. Cooperation 
simply means voting judicial nominees 
brought to the floor up or down. 

So let me say this: If my Democratic 
colleagues exercise self-restraint and 
do not filibuster judicial nominees, 

Senate traditions will be restored. It 
will then be unnecessary to change 
Senate procedures. Self-restraint on 
the use of the filibuster for nominations—
the very same self-restraint 
that Senate minorities exercised for 
more than two centuries—will alleviate 
the need for any action. But if my 
Democratic colleagues continue to filibuster 
judicial nominees, the Senate 
will face this choice: Fail to do its constitutional 
duty or reform itself and restore 
its traditions, and do what the 
Framers intended. 

Right now, we cannot be certain judicial 
filibusters will cease. So I reserve 
the right to propose changes to Senate 
rule XXII, and do not acquiesce to carrying 
over all the rules from the last 
Congress. 

As a public servant who has twice 
taken an oath to support and defend 
the Constitution, I cannot stand idly 
by, nor should any of us, if the Senate 
fails to do its constitutional duty. We, 
as Senators, have our constitutional 
duty to offer the President advice and 
consent. 

Although our constitutional duties 
are paramount, we also have a legislative 
responsibility to the people we 
serve and to the Nation. This is our opportunity 
to take on the challenges 
that each of us sought public office to 
pursue. After all, we are here not just 
to occupy our offices but to lead, to be 
bold, to take action, and to get things 
done. 

First, there is work left undone from 
the last Congress, and we need to act 
on it. 

America is long overdue for an energy 
policy. We need a plan in place to 
reduce our dependence on foreign oil 
and bolster conservation efforts. Last 
Congress, the Senate passed an energy 
bill that would have done just that. I 
am hopeful we will be able to do the 
same this year and work with House 
leaders and the President to finish the 
job. 

We also need to eliminate frivolous 
lawsuits by reforming asbestos liability, 
medical liability, and our class action 
system. Frivolous lawsuits cost 
our economy more than $250 billion per 
year. That is more than 2 percent of 
our gross domestic product—the equivalent 
of over $800 on every American. 
To keep our economy growing and 
competitive, we need to act now. 

I will bring class action reform to the 
floor early next month. I am confident 
we will pass this bill and take a big 
first step to restoring sanity and fairness 
to our legal system. 

Second, in the last Congress, we led 
on the most urgent issues facing America. 
And we still need to keep our focus 
on issues such as protecting our homeland 
from biological threats. But we 
must also lead today on tomorrow’s 
challenges. We need to look to the horizon 
and ask ourselves: What will be 
the cost in the future if we fail to act 
now? 

The President has put Social Security 
reform among his top priorities for 

his second term. He has laid out wise 
and essential principles: protecting the 
benefits of today’s seniors, not raising 
payroll taxes, and giving younger 
Americans the opportunity to save, 
own, and invest a portion of their own 
Social Security dollars. But in the end, 
the details on how to accomplish Social 
Security reform will fall to Congress. 
This will require a tremendous 
amount of work, especially from our 
skilled committee chairmen. It will 
also require us to work together across 
the aisle—both parties in both Houses. 
If we do so, I believe we will be able to 
achieve the goal of putting a bill that 
addresses the short-term and long-term 
gaps in Social Security on the President’s 
desk. 

As we consider Social Security reform, 
we cannot turn a blind eye to 
other entitlements. Gathering on the 
horizon is a Medicare perfect storm: 
skyrocketing health care costs that are 
affecting every family and an increasing 
number of seniors—a doubling in 
the number of seniors—over the next 30 
years, and fewer and fewer workers 
paying into the program. 

Keeping the promise of Medicare to 
seniors will place an untenable burden 
on younger Americans and their children 
and their grandchildren. In fact, 
the total unfunded liability in the 
Medicare Program far exceeds Social 
Security’s unfunded liability. We have 
a moral responsibility to begin to have 
a conversation about the long-term 
challenges facing Medicare. 

In the short term, we can work to reduce 
health care costs in general. The 
fact is, our health care system—it is 
not even really a system. Our health 
care sector is fantastically inefficient. 
We can make it much more productive. 

Just think about it for a minute. We 
can access our bank accounts from 
nearly anywhere in the world with our 
ATM cards, but we can’t transfer our 
CAT scan results digitally from one 
hospital to another hospital across the 
street for a second opinion. We can pay 
bills on line, we can order groceries on 
line, and we can even apply for a mortgage 
on line—all in a matter of minutes. 
But if we happen to be in a car accident, 
if we are knocked unconscious 
with our lives at stake, paramedics and 
emergency room doctors cannot quickly 
check for blood type or allergies to 
our medicines. 

It doesn’t make sense. We can fix it 
by encouraging the use of information 
technology. By reforming our broken 
medical liability system, by expanding 
portable tax-free accounts, among 
other things, we can begin to hold that 
line on health care costs and improve 
our system. 

I am pleased the President is firmly 
committed to working with Congress 
to make health care more affordable 
and accessible. 

He is also committed, as I am, to protecting 
the values that serve as the 
foundation of a healthy society: Marriage, 
family, and a culture of life that 
protects human dignity at every stage 
of development. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S15 

Finally, we need to elevate global 
issues of moral consequence. 

This is becoming increasingly apparent 
in the past week. During the last 9 
days, we have all been deeply saddened 
by the unfolding tragedy in Southern 
Asia. Estimates now put the death toll 
at more than 150,000, more than a third 
of which are children. And the statistics 
don’t capture the sorrow, the sadness, 
that sense of loss, the psychological 
impact that will leave longstanding 
scars. 

When we resume our business later 
this month and the President requests 
our assistance, we will set aside what 
we are working on to provide funding 
quickly and cleanly. 

Later tonight I will be leaving with 
several of our colleagues to travel to 
the devastated areas. We will report 
back about what America can do to aid 
relief and recovery efforts. 

America is the most generous Nation 
in the world. We will step up with all 
the resources, all the compassion, all 
the hope that we can muster in these 
next few weeks and beyond. We have 
done so as a nation. We have done so as 
a people many times before. 

Last Congress we stepped up in the 
fight against global HIV/AIDS. We 
stepped up with an unprecedented $15 
billion commitment. We will keep that 
commitment strong. We need to work 
hard to bring peace, stability, and humanitarian 
support to war-torn nations 
such as Sudan. 

Americans are a compassionate people. 
We, as Senators, can help capture 
that and channel it for the good of the 
world. It is our responsibility. We will 
do just that. 

In his most recent news conference, 
President Bush said this about his second-
term agenda: 

All of these goals require the energy and 
dedication of members of both political parties. 
Working in a spirit of bipartisanship, 
we will build the foundation of a stronger, 
more prosperous country. 

The President is exactly right. The 
challenges before this Congress are so 
vital to the future of our country. We 
must work together to address them. 
Through our history, America has been 
served best by leaders who treat each 
other and their offices with respect and 
civility and decency. 

I think of George Washington who, at 
the age of just 16, copied out by hand a 
list of 110 Rules of Civility and Decent 
Behavior in Company and Conversation. 
This act shaped the early character 
of Washington and in turn the indelible 
character of our Nation. 

In recent history, Ronald Reagan and 
Tip O’Neill come to mind. Although 
they stood on opposite sides of the ideological 
spectrum, they enjoyed a wonderful 
relationship, a fruitful friendship. 
On the Speaker’s 70th birthday, 
President Reagan invited him to the 
White House for a celebratory lunch. 
At the end of the meal, the President 
raised a glass of champagne and toasted 
the Speaker: 

Tip, if I had a ticket to heaven and you 
didn’t have one, too, I’d sell mine and go to 
hell with you. 

Many have enjoyed friendships just 
like that in the Senate. I know I do, 
and so do many of our spouses. The 
Senate, as I have often said and referred 
to in my remarks earlier today, 
is a family. The sense of family does 
not come across on the television 
screen and certainly doesn’t come 
across in the newspapers. What the 
American people too often see and 
what I don’t believe they like is an extreme 
partisanship, a partisan bickering 
and a lack of cooperation. Some 
of that is just the nature of the news. 
Conflict, as we all know, sells advertising 
and catches people’s attention, 
but it is also the nature of Washington 
today with all of the competing special 
interests. 

There is still something else at work. 
Somehow, we have become more defined 
by the forces that divide us than 
the common cause that unites us. The 
civility that once was the hallmark of 
this body has eroded over time. I recognize, 
we all recognize, it will take time 
to regain it. But we must begin. We 
must begin now and we will begin. 

I applaud the orientation for new 
Members that Senators CARPER and 
ALEXANDER and others helped organize 
just this November. Our nine newly 
elected Senators worked with veterans 
of this body to learn, as my colleague 
from Tennessee said, what it takes for 
the Senate to function as an institution 
and fulfill its constitutional role. 
We need more efforts just like this, 
such as in Senate policy forums, bipartisan 
leadership meetings, all of which 
would be a good start. 

These are issues I have discussed 
with the Democratic leader. I ask our 
colleagues to come to Senator REID 
and me with other suggestions they 
may have over the next several weeks. 
Leaders on both sides of the aisle need 
to set an example, but the whole body 
needs to share in this effort. We all 
need to commit to restoring civility in 
the Senate. If we do, with time, I believe, 
the Senate again can become 
what it was in the so-called golden age, 
what the great statesman and Senator, 
Daniel Webster, called in his last major 
address: 

. . . A body not yet moved from its propriety, 
not lost to a just sense of its own dignity 
and own responsibilities, and a body to 
which the country looks, with confidence, 
for wise, moderate, patriotic and healing 
counsels. 

I close by expressing a concept that 
is by no means new but is essential to 
our deliberations and, in the end, to 
the future for America. It is the concept 
that this body, the Senate, act as 
one. 

During my decade of service in this 
body, I have seen extraordinary acts of 
courage. I have seen men and women 
endure overwhelming currents of political 
pressure. Sometimes they have 
done this standing alone and independent; 
sometimes they have crossed 
the aisle and cast a deciding vote with 
the opposing party. Every time, however, 
it has been for one simple reason: 

to do what their hearts told them was 
right for the people they represent and 
for the Nation. 

Where leaders perform such acts of 
courage, they subjugate their own political 
interests to the higher purpose 
of the whole. Although they may pay a 
political price, they are rewarded with 
honor and with pride and with respect. 

In the end, those rewards are priceless. 
Those rewards last—not only in 
the hearts of public servants but in the 
hearts of the people they represent. 

The Senate’s longest serving majority 
leader, the late Mike Mansfield, 
said of this body: 

In the end, it is not the Senators as individuals 
who are a fundamental importance. 
In the end, it is the institution of this Senate. 
It is the Senate itself as one of the foundations 
of the Constitution. It is the Senate 
as one of the rocks of the Republic. 

Let us do the duty of U.S. Senators, 
our constitutional duty and our duty 
to our people and our Nation. Let us do 
so with respect and civility and decency 
for this body and for each other. 
As we do, let us secure for every American 
a freer, safer, and healthier future. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MARTINEZ). 
The Senator from Oregon.

HEALTH CARE 

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he 
leaves the Chamber, I commend the 
majority leader for his interest in 
health care, in particular. I have always 
thought it is far away the most 
important issue at home. I have come 
to the Senate to talk about some of the 
opportunities in this session to work in 
a bipartisan way on these critical 
issues. In fact, I was going to mention 
that the Senator and I have pursued 
legislation to tackle the problem of 
child obesity. I appreciate the majority 
leader’s interest in health care and 
look forward to working with him in 
this session. 

Mr. President, colleagues, I have believed 
health care is the most important 
issue at home since my days as director 
of the Oregon Gray Panthers. I 
have thought health care was the most 
important issue because, in a sense, if 
our folks do not have their health, it is 
not possible to work, to learn, to raise 
children, or do much of anything the 
American people value. 

For me, this is the big priority at 
home. When we look at what is happening 
today with medical costs gobbling 
up everything in sight, the demographic 
revolution with so many more 
older people, the tremendous lifesaving 
technologies we have today which, of 
course, carry a big price tag, all of 
these forces come together to present 
an issue that just cannot be ducked 
any longer. To put it in perspective, 
David Walker, the Comptroller General 
of the Government Accountability Office, 
put it pretty well, saying that the 
Medicare problem is about seven times 
greater than the Social Security problem 
and it has gotten much worse. It is 


S16 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 2005 

much bigger. It is more immediate. It 
is going to be much more difficult to 
effectively address. 

That is the view of the Comptroller 
General. He is talking about Medicare. 
But in my view, the concerns that 
David Walker talks about with respect 
to Medicare extend to the health care 
system as a whole. 

This afternoon for a few minutes I 
will chart a course as it relates to 
health care: first, a number of steps 
that could be taken right now that 
would significantly help the American 
people as we deal with this health care 
challenge. Then I will discuss, for the 
longer term, another bipartisan effort I 
have had a chance to team up with 
Senator HATCH on that will be implemented 
over the next few weeks. 

But if I might, I would like to start 
with Medicare. I think Senator FRIST 
is right; these Medicare costs are soaring. 
For the prescription drug legislation 
alone, it is clear now the price tag 
will be in the vicinity of $100 billion 
more than Congress originally calculated. 
That is the current estimate. 
Many have said it will be much greater. 
I think it is critically important 
that steps be taken to contain costs, 
particularly as relates to this fast-
growing area that we will be faced 
with, that is prescription drugs. 

We all hear about it from our constituents. 
Every time we are home, 
folks tell us about how skyrocketing 
prescription drug costs are such a hardship 
on them. They want to know what 
Congress is going to do to respond to 
it. 

One of the things I think has been so 
exacerbating about this issue of cost 
containment as it relates to prescription 
drugs is that the Medicare program 
is not even employing the kind of 
cost containment tools you see in the 
private sector. If you are talking, for 
example, about a big timber company, 
the Presiding Officer (the Senator from 
Idaho) and I know big timber firms and 
other natural resources firms use their 
bargaining power in order to try to 
hold down the cost of medicine and 
other essentials. The Medicare program 
is not doing that. The Medicare 
program is not using the kind of bargaining 
power that exists in the private 
sector today. 

In fact, if you are an older person, 
and you go off and purchase your medicine, 
either now or even in the future, 
under many of the plans that will be 
offered under the new program, you 
have no bargaining power, and in effect 
you are subsidizing those big private-
sector buyers, whether they are steel 
firms, timber firms, auto companies, or 
various other kinds of concerns. I do 
not think that is right. 

(Mr. TALENT assumed the chair.) 

Mr. WYDEN. I am very pleased I have 
had a chance over the last few years to 
team up with Senator SNOWE of Maine 
on a bipartisan effort to contain those 
prescription drug costs, using essentially 
the model of more bargaining 
power the way private sector firms 
have. 

Part of the Medicare prescription 
drug bill that I think is very unfortunate 
is a statutory ban on Medicare 
using its bargaining power to hold 
down the cost of medicine the way big 
private-sector buyers would use their 
bargaining power. So Senator SNOWE 
and I would like to change that. We 
would like to lift that bargaining 
power restriction so Medicare would be 
in a position to use marketplace forces 
to hold down the cost of prescription 
drugs. 

A few weeks ago, we got a big boost 
for our bipartisan legislation when the 
outgoing Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, Secretary Tommy 
Thompson, said he wished he had had 
the power the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden 
legislation would provide. Secretary 
Thompson gave a press conference, I 
believe on the day he announced his 
resignation, and specifically said he 
wished he had had the tools that the 
bipartisan legislation the Senator from 
Maine and I have authored would provide 
at the time of his service because 
he could have made those scarce Medicare 
dollars stretch further. 

So I think Secretary Thompson gave 
a pretty ringing bipartisan endorsement 
for the legislation Senator SNOWE 
and I will be reintroducing very shortly. 
It seems to me to make sure that 
seniors get the best value in the marketplace, 
that taxpayers get their money’s 
worth under the Medicare program, 
a program that is, of course, 
soaring in costs, we ought to make 
sure we use the kinds of tools the private 
sector uses. 

In the bipartisan legislation I have 
written with Senator SNOWE—it is 
called the MEND bill, the Medicare Enhancement 
for Needed Drugs legislation—
we would have a chance, in my 
view, to significantly rein in these 
costs using the power of the marketplace. 
But I bring this up first by way 
of saying this is just the beginning of 
what I think we could do in this session 
of Congress. 

I want to move now to the issue of 
catastrophic illness. The Senator from 
Missouri and I represent a lot of small 
businesses. We enjoyed our service on 
the Small Business Committee when 
we were in the House. I think we and 
our colleagues all understand if you 
have a small business, say a hardware 
store with six people, and one or two of 
them get particularly sick, that essentially 
blows the whole health care system 
for that small hardware store or 
furniture shop or what have you. In effect, 
if one or two of the people get sick 
at the small business, the premiums go 
through the roof for everybody, and 
they essentially can go so high that it 
is not possible for the firm to offer coverage 
at all. 

I was struck in the campaign by Senator 
KERRY’s proposal because I 
thought it was a very innovative way 
to help those small businesses rein in 
their costs. In effect, he was going to 
use the concept of reinsurance for very 
large bills that would be faced by a 

small business. If you have the Government 
picking up the very large bills for 
the one or two people at the hardware 
store in Missouri who have these illnesses, 
that can stabilize the rate system 
for everybody. 

I thought the Kerry proposal was a 
good idea. I come to the floor to bring 
it up because I think if you compare 
the Kerry proposal to some of the ideas 
offered by the distinguished majority 
leader, Senator FRIST, who was just on 
the floor, his Healthy Mae proposal, 
while different than the Kerry proposal, 
certainly in a number of respects 
both of them are looking at the same 
core concept, which is to use this idea 
of reinsurance to pick up the very large 
bills that would be faced by some of 
our small businesses. 

I think when you look at the Kerry 
proposal, when you look at the Frist 
proposal, there is a lot of common 
ground there to tackle a health care 
issue of enormous concern to millions 
of families. All across this country we 
have citizens who face the prospect of 
going to bed at night knowing that if 
the medical bills soar through the roof, 
they could lose everything. They could 
lose their home, the capacity to educate 
their kids. They could lose virtually 
everything. 

So I think it is important we enact a 
catastrophic illness program. This 
idea, by the way, has percolated around 
for decades. Democratic Presidents 
have talked about it. Republican Presidents 
have talked about it. Senator 
KERRY has authored an innovative proposal. 
Senator FRIST has come up with 
ideas that I happen to think are attractive. 
What we ought to be doing as a 
body is looking for common ground and 
the opportunity to work together. As 
Senator SNOWE and I have done with 
prescription drug cost containment, I 
would hope the Senate could come together 
for a bipartisan catastrophic illness 
proposal that I think would make 
a very meaningful dent in these huge 
expenses we so often face for catastrophic 
illness. 

There are other areas that lend 
themselves to immediate action as 
well. In this regard, I particularly commend 
the distinguished senior Senator 
from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI, and 
the senior Senator from Massachusetts, 
Mr. KENNEDY, for their outstanding 
work on mental health. We 
have been working for some time to try 
to ensure that there would be mental 
health parity. Having had my late 
brother, Jeff, suffer from schizophrenia, 
I have watched these families 
jostled around in the health care system 
for years. I know colleagues of 
both political parties have as well. 
There is no reason why we cannot get 
a bipartisan mental health parity effort, 
a Domenici-Kennedy bill, working 
with the other body, get that enacted 
into law, and get it sent to the President—
again, a chance for immediate 
action. 

Finally, I mentioned briefly the issue 
of childhood obesity. It is obvious that 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S17 

we now have literally an epidemic of 
childhood obesity problems occurring 
early on in life that produce other 
deadly and costly illnesses such as diabetes 
and heart disease. Senator FRIST 
and I, working with a group of health 
advocates for children and independent 
scientists, have put together a bipartisan 
bill. I hope we can use that legislation 
as an opportunity for the Senate 
to come together. 

Our proposal essentially involves a 
modest Government role, particularly 
at the outset of the program. Then we 
use a foundation approach to generate 
additional funds in the private sector. 
But at the end of the day, under that 
legislation, we would have a grassroots 
juggernaut all across the country focused 
on our schools, on our families, 
tackling this issue of childhood obesity. 
Again, there is no reason why we 
could not act immediately. 

On these kinds of issues—and I have 
outlined four of them now—I believe 
Congress is on the cusp of success. Bipartisan 
efforts are underway. Certainly 
they need some tweaking and 
some changes, going through the committee 
process and the negotiations 
that are essential to pass legislation, 
but for all practical purposes, in each 
of these areas—prescription drug cost 
containment, a program to deal with 
catastrophic illness, mental health parity, 
and fighting childhood obesity—we 
have legislation that is camera-ready 
to tackle these very serious health care 
concerns. We ought to have it. 

As the Congress moves on these initiatives, 
we have to also move to address 
the health care system of tomorrow. 
In this regard, Senator HATCH and 
I have worked for several years on the 
Health Care That Works for All Americans 
Act. We got it funded finally last 
year as part of the appropriations legislation. 
Now the Government Accountability 
Office is moving to set in 
place the first stage of the legislation, 
which would involve naming the 14 individuals 
who would be part of the Citizens’ 
Health Care Working Group. 

The bipartisan effort Senator HATCH 
and I have pursued for several years is 
built on the proposition that it is time 
for the country and the Congress to try 
something different and to look at this 
in a dramatically altered way. This 
may be of some interest to the Presiding 
Officer because essentially 
Harry Truman, in the 81st Congress in 
1945, tried on the health care issue 
what Bill Clinton tried back in 1993 and 
1994, and essentially all Presidents 
have tried in between the 1940s and the 
1990s. That was to write legislation in 
Washington, DC. The American people 
would find these big Federal health reform 
bills incomprehensible. The various 
powerful interest groups would attack 
each other. And essentially nothing 
would happen. It was essentially 
driven in the confines of the beltway in 
Washington. Literally for more than 
five decades in the debate about creating 
a health care system that works 
for everybody, we would essentially 
have paralysis. 

What Senator HATCH and I have 
sought to do is to try something different; 
that is, to essentially start this 
debate outside the beltway, to try to 
involve the American people in the 
most important questions, not the various 
arcane issues about what every 
single payroll tax level ought to be, but 
the big kinds of questions—I will outline 
a couple of those in a moment— 
and then use that kind of effort, where 
citizens could be involved in community 
meetings, citizens could weigh in 
online, citizens could participate in a 
variety of ways, to try to build a consensus 
for the kinds of reforms that 
would be needed to create a health care 
system that works for everyone. 

Under our legislation, after the Citizens’ 
Working Group is named by Mr. 
Walker, the head of the Government 
Accountability Office, what happens 
next is the working group essentially 
would put out for the American people, 
in simple, straightforward English, information—
it could be available on-
line, in booklets, senior centers, other 
places where folks gather—about where 
the health care dollar goes today. This 
year we are going to spend in the vicinity 
of about $1.8 trillion on health care. 
That is what we are spending on health 
care, yet it is clear that as far as the 
country is concerned, there really is no 
sense where that $1.8 trillion goes now 
and what the alternatives are for perhaps 
spending it in a different fashion. 

That would be the first task of the 
Citizens’ Working Group, to put out 
online, in booklets available throughout 
our communities, information 
about where the health care dollar goes 
today and what the various options are 
for where it might be targeted as an alternative 
so Americans would have a 
chance to say: Look, what I am interested 
in is this kind of approach. Let’s 
say a health savings account or the Associated 
Health Plan concept, the 
health plan concept the Senator from 
Missouri has advocated. 

Other citizens might say: I am interested 
in a single payer kind of system, 
perhaps in a small community. They 
think that is the approach that makes 
sense for them. The point is, until you 
tell the American people where the 
health care dollar is going now, it is 
hard to have a debate with respect to 
changes that might be necessary so the 
Congress, on a bipartisan basis, could 
in effect move forward with legislation 
that would create a system that works 
for everybody. 

When Senator HATCH and I began this 
effort, we made a systematic effort to 
make it as inclusive as we possibly 
could. The legislation early on won the 
support of the Chamber of Commerce, 
the AFL–CIO, and the American Association 
of Retired Persons—certainly a 
coalition that doesn’t agree all the 
time on health care or other kinds of 
issues. We have had many groups endorse 
the effort since. The reason they 
have is they believe it is critical that 
something new be tried. 

What happens under our legislation, 
after the Citizens’ Working Group has 

made it possible for folks to see where 
the $1.8 trillion we are spending on 
health care goes now, is that our citizens 
will have a chance to participate 
in open community meetings, online, 
and other kinds of sessions so that they 
would have a chance to be heard on the 
second stage of this very different approach 
with respect to health care reform. 


After our citizens have had a chance 
to be heard, then the Citizens’ Working 
Group in effect takes that kind of sentiment 
they have heard from all corners 
of the Nation and tries to synthesize 
it into a set of recommendations 
to the Congress. And under our 
legislation, within 60 days after the 
Citizens’ Working Group has provided 
the recommendations to the Congress 
with respect to what the American people 
have said, each committee of jurisdiction 
has to begin hearings on what 
has come from the Citizens’ Working 
Group in terms of the recommendations 
of the American people. 

I want to close by giving a few examples 
of the kind of areas where I think 
we have to have the input of the American 
people where they have never been 
asked. For example, the issue of end-of-
life care is absolutely essential in 
terms of a new focus for health care reform. 
We know that many of our 
health care dollars are spent in the last 
few months of an individual’s life. We 
are told by many medical experts—doctors, 
hospitals, and others—that in 
many of those instances there is nothing 
they can do that is medically effective, 
and there is nothing they can do 
to enhance the quality of life for the 
individual. So the question for the 
country and for courageous political 
leadership is: What should we do with 
respect to end-of-life care? 

If we are being told by our best doctors 
and hospitals that they cannot do 
anything that is medically effective, 
cannot do anything to promote a better 
quality of life for individuals, do we 
want to refocus the health care dollars 
to make sure, for example, that there 
are better hospice programs and better 
end-of-life care programs for individuals 
facing those kinds of health challenges? 
I personally think that is 
where the American people are going 
to end up. Let’s ask them, for the first 
time, how they want to deal with these 
very difficult social and ethical issues 
with respect to American health care. I 
submit that financial issues with respect 
to health care are very difficult, 
no question about that. I think the social 
and ethical issues, with respect to 
end-of-life care, where much of the 
health care dollar gets spent today, are 
even more challenging, but we have to 
act. That is the kind of question that 
would be posed by the Citizens’ Working 
Group. I think other issues are important. 


I am particularly interested in the 
issue of personal responsibility. I think 
that has been part of what has been 
driving the debate with respect to 
health savings accounts and other such 


S18 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 2005 

approaches. I have been discussing with 
my constituents in town hall meetings 
the idea that if we are to have a system 
that works for everybody in terms of 
affordable quality health care, I am 
prepared to say that an individual 
should, every time they use a medical 
service, if they are not destitute, have 
to make a payment on the spot so as to 
ensure that there is a clear requirement 
of personal responsibility. Certainly, 
that will be controversial, but 
that is the kind of issue that has to be 
discussed with respect to health reform. 


Finally, I think the question of addressing 
health care—and particularly 
Senator HATCH and I have tried to do it 
in a bipartisan way—means you have 
to get beyond the blame game. Sometimes 
when you have a discussion 
about health care, the topic comes up 
that Republicans say it is the trial lawyers’ 
fault; nail the trial lawyers and 
everything is going to be fine. Then 
you go meet with Democrats and 
Democrats say, yes, we have to have 
health reform. Go nail the insurance 
companies; do that and everything will 
be fine. I think—and Senator HATCH 
and I have talked about this—if we are 
going to have a health care program 
that works for all Americans, we are 
going to have to get beyond the blame 
game. You bet changes need to be made 
in the insurance sector, because they 
do skim the cream and take the 
healthy people, and they do send sick 
people to Government programs that 
are sicker than they are. There do need 
to be changes in those insurance practices. 
I think we also understand that 
there are frivolous cases and abuses in 
the legal sector, and changes would be 
necessary there if we are to have meaningful 
reform and a health care program 
that works for all Americans. 

It seems to me this is an issue that 
we cannot duck because come 2010, 
2011, 2012, medical costs will clearly 
consume just about everything in 
sight. I submit that the problems we 
are seeing today in terms of small business 
premium hikes, folks falling between 
the cracks—they are not old 
enough for Medicare or not poor 
enough for Medicaid; our Medicare providers 
are understandably frustrated 
by the reimbursement system—if we 
keep nibbling at the Medicare health 
care system, the problems we are seeing 
today are going to seem like small 
potatoes compared to what happens in 
2010, 2011, and 2012. On New Year’s Day 
in 2008, this demographic influx, in effect, 
of 7 million-plus retirees we will 
see over the next few years is going to 
start to retire. That happens New 
Year’s Day 2008. So the reason I have 
come to the floor this afternoon is I 
wanted to outline a number of steps— 
four, specifically—that I thought Congress 
could tackle in a bipartisan way 
that would make a meaningful difference 
right now: the legislation Senator 
SNOWE and I have authored in 
terms of prescription drug cost containment, 
using marketplace forces to 

hold down prescription drug costs; catastrophic 
illness, and looking particularly 
at ideas that Senators KERRY and 
FRIST have talked about; the question 
of mental health parity; childhood obesity. 
Again, we can build where there is 
a bipartisan foundation for congressional 
action. These are steps we ought 
to take now. Then we ought to use the 
next couple of years—as Senator HATCH 
and I have tried to do in a bipartisan 
kind of way—to build a health care system 
that works for all Americans. Our 
legislation is moving ahead. 

The Government Accountability Office 
is appointing the Citizens’ Health 
Care Working Group right now. The $3 
million appropriated for the legislation—
and I am grateful to Senators 
SPECTER and HARKIN for that particular 
work—is going to allow us, in 
our Health Care That Works For All 
Americans Act, to take a very different 
approach to break this spiral which 
dates back to 1945, tried by Harry Truman 
in the 81st Congress, and continued 
literally up through the time of 
President Clinton. Making sure the 
public has the facts is the first task of 
the Citizens’ Health Care Working 
Group established in the legislation I 
have authored with Senator HATCH. 
Second is to make sure the public gets 
a chance to weigh in. Finally, to ensure 
public accountability, the Congress is 
under a requirement to move forward 
with hearings after the Citizens’ Working 
Group has reported. 

So I think it is appropriate on this 
first day of the new session to zero in 
on the health care issue. I have been 
very closely following the discussions 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
have made with respect to the tragedy 
that has taken place overseas. I am 
very pleased to hear that Majority 
Leader FRIST is leading a trip to the 
area and will come back with ideas for 
bipartisan action on that terrible tragedy. 
I wanted to talk about what I 
think is the most pressing issue at 
home, the health care challenge, and 
particularly to outline bipartisan steps 
that could be taken now. I also look 
forward to working with my colleagues 
as the legislation I have authored with 
Senator HATCH is implemented in the 
weeks ahead. 

I yield the floor. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
CHAFEE). The Senator from Oklahoma. 

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be recognized 
for up to 45 minutes as in morning 
business. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 

Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first let 
me say to my friend, Senator WYDEN, 
he has always been a champion of that 
cause. A lot of us with different political 
philosophies rely on his judgment, 
his experience, his background, and 
those things he has accomplished in 
the field of health care. I look forward 
to working with him in this coming 
year. 

GLOBAL WARMING DEBATE 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as I said 
on the Senate floor on July 28, 2003, 
much of the debate over global warming 
is predicated on fear rather than 
science. I am the chairman of the Environment 
and Public Works Committee. 
In addition to its normal expected jurisdictions, 
the committee also has a 
lot to do with the Energy bill. We have 
probably as many provisions in the Energy 
bill as the Energy Committee 
does. It is one with which we have 
great concern. 
We recognize we have an energy crisis 
in America. The House passed a 
very good Energy bill last year. We 
should have passed it in the Senate. We 
did not. I hope we will pass it this 
time. In the meantime, we need to do 
what I committed to do when I became 
chairman of the Environment and Public 
Works Committee 2 years ago. We 
are going to encourage decisions that 
are made in Government to be made on 
sound science. 
Many times that is not the case, and 
such a case is the hoax referred to as 
‘‘global warming.’’ I called the threat 
of catastrophic global warming the 
greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the 
American people in a statement, to put 
it mildly, that was not viewed very 
kindly by the environmental extremists 
and their elitist organizations. 
I also pointed out in a lengthy committee 
report that those same environmental 
extremists exploit the issue for 
fundraising purposes, raking in millions 
of dollars, even using Federal taxpayers’ 
dollars to finance the campaigns. 
For these groups, the issue of catastrophic 
global warming is not just a 
favored fundraising tool. In truth, it is 
more fundamental than that. Put simply, 
man-induced global warming is an 
article of religious faith to the radical 
far left alarmists. Therefore, contending 
that its central tenets are 
flawed to them is heresy and of the 
most despicable kind. Furthermore, 
scientists who challenge its tenets are 
attacked sometimes personally for 
blindly ignoring the so-called scientific 
consensus. That is not all. Because of 
their skeptical views, they are contemptuous, 
dismissed for being ‘‘out of 
the mainstream.’’ 
This seems to me highly ironic. 
Aren’t scientists to be nonconforming 
and question consensus? Nevertheless, 
it is not hard to read between the lines. 
‘‘Skeptic’’ and ‘‘out of mainstream’’ 
are their thinly veiled code phrases 
meaning anyone who doubts the alarmists’ 
orthodoxy is, in short, a quack. 
I have insisted all along that the climate 
change debate should be based on 
fundamental principles and science, 
not religion. Ultimately, I hope it will 
be decided by hard facts and data and 
by serious scientists committed to the 
principles of sound science instead of 
censoring skeptical viewpoints, as my 
alarmist friends favor. 
These scientists must be heard, and I 
will do my part to make sure they are 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S19 

heard. I am sure the Presiding Officer 
from Rhode Island is very much concerned 
with the sound science with 
which we address this subject. 

Since my detailed climate change 
speech in 2003, so-called skeptics continue 
to speak out. What they are saying 
is devastating to the alarmists. 
They amassed additional scientific evidence 
convincingly refuting the alarmists’ 
most cherished assumptions and 
beliefs. New evidence has emerged that 
further undermines their conclusions, 
most notably those of the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change, IPCC, one of the major 
pillars of the authorities cited by the 
extremists and climate alarmists. 

I guess what I am saying is we are 
going to be looking at this new evidence. 
Just since we have adjourned 
and have come back in today to swear 
in our new Members, the scientists are 
almost entirely on the side that there 
is no sound science behind the idea 
that, No. 1, the climate is changing 
and, No. 2, if it is that it is the result 
of manmade gases. Evidence has come 
to light in very interesting times. 

Just last month, the 10th Conference 
of the Parties—that is called the COP– 
10—to the Framework Convention on 
Climate Change met in Buenos Aires to 
discuss Kyoto’s implementation and 
measures to pursue beyond Kyoto. 

As most of my colleagues know, 
Kyoto goes into effect on February 16. 
I think, with the exception of Russia, 
an exception I will explain later, the 
nations that ratified Kyoto and agreed 
to submit to its mandates are making 
a very serious mistake. 

I went to this meeting, the conference, 
COP–9, last year in Milan, 
Italy. It was shocking to see what was 
actually going on there. I was involved 
in a mission in west Africa. I saw a person 
I deal with on a regular basis from 
a little country in west Africa who was 
there. It happens that his title in his 
country’s government is Minister of 
the Environment. I said: What are you 
doing here? Do you really believe in 
this Kyoto stuff? 

He said: Oh, no, this is the biggest 
party of the year. 

These people are paid for by the 
United Nations and paid for by this 
country, in an inordinate amount, percentage, 
to come up with and have big 
parties for 3, 4, 5 days in some of the 
most exotic places in the world just to 
show support for Kyoto. It is outrageous. 


In addition, last month, a popular author, 
Dr. Michael Crichton, who has 
questioned the wisdom of those who 
trumpet a scientific consensus, released 
a new book called ‘‘State of 
Fear.’’ You all know who Dr. Michael 
Crichton is. He is a medical doctor as 
well as a scientist and best-selling author. 
This is all premised on the global 
warming debate. 

I am happy to report Dr. Crichton’s 
new book reached No. 3 on the New 
York Times bestseller list. I highly recommend 
this book to the Presiding Of


ficer. I will supply him with this book 
because I think it is imperative people 
see some of what is going on right now 
and how public opinion is catching on 
to this hoax that has permeated our 
country for so long. 

Dr. Crichton, as I said, is a medical 
doctor and scientist. He very cleverly 
weaved a very compelling presentation 
of the scientific facts of climate 
change—with ample footnotes and documentation 
throughout, I might add— 
into a gripping plot. From what I can 
gather Dr. Crichton’s book is designed 
to bring some sanity to the global 
warming debate. In the author’s message 
at the end of his book, he refreshingly 
states what scientists have suspected 
for years. He says: 

We are also in the midst of a natural 
warming trend that began about 1850— 

I do not know who will argue with 
that. 

—as we emerged from a 400 year cold spell 
known as the Little Ice Age. 

Dr. Crichton states that ‘‘nobody 
knows how much of the present warming 
trend might be a natural phenomenon,’’ 
and ‘‘Nobody knows how 
much of the present trend might be 
man-made.’’ 

For those who see impending disaster 
in the coming century, Dr. Crichton 
writes: 

I suspect that people of 2100 will be much 
richer than we are, consume much more energy, 
have a smaller global population, and 
enjoy more wilderness than we have today. I 
don’t think we have to worry about them. 

For those who do worry or induce 
such worries in others, ‘‘State of Fear’’ 
has a very simple message: Stop worrying 
and stop spreading fear. 
Throughout the book, fictional environmental 
organizations are more focused 
on raising money, principally by 
scaring potential contributors with 
bogus scientific claims and predictions 
of the global apocalypse, than they are 
with saving the environment. 

As the saying goes, here we have art 
imitating life. As my colleagues will 
remember from a floor speech I gave 
last year, this is part and parcel of 
what these organizations peddle to the 
general public. Their fearmongering 
knows no bounds. Just consider the debate 
over mercury emissions. President 
Bush proposed the first ever cap to reduce 
mercury emissions from power-
plants by 70 percent. True to form, 
these groups said he was allowing more 
mercury into the air. Now stop and 
think about it. Right now there is no 
cap on mercury. It is proposed by this 
President for the first time. 

As I mentioned earlier, several nations, 
including the United States, met 
in Buenos Aires in December for the 
10th round of the international climate 
change negotiations. I am happy to report 
that the U.S. delegation held firm 
both in its categorical rejection of 
Kyoto and the questionable science behind 
it. 

Paula Dobriansky, Under Secretary 
of State for Global Affairs and the 
leader of the U.S. delegation, put it 
very well when she told the conference: 

Science tells us that we cannot say with 
any certainty what constitutes a dangerous 
level of warming, and therefore what level 
must be avoided. 

Ms. Dobriansky and her team also 
rebuffed attempts by the European 
Union to drag the United States into 
discussions concerning post-Kyoto climate 
change commitments. With the 
ink barely dry on Kyoto ratification, 
not to mention what the science of climate 
change is telling us, Ms. 
Dobriansky was right in dubbing post-
2012 talks premature. 

It was clear from discussions in Buenos 
Aires that Kyoto supporters desperately 
want the United States to impose 
on itself mandatory greenhouse 
emissions controls. Moreover, there 
was considerable discussion but no apparent 
resolution over how to address 
emissions from developing countries 
such as India and especially China, 
which over the coming decades will be 
the world’s leading emitter of greenhouse 
gases. 

Developing nations, most notably 
China, remained adamant in Buenos 
Aires in opposing any mandatory 
greenhouse gas reductions now or any 
time in the future. Securing this commitment 
was a necessary component 
for the U.S. ratification of Kyoto. 

Now, some may not have been here at 
the time, but 2 years ago we passed the 
Byrd-Hagel resolution that said that if 
Kyoto treats developing nations any 
different than developed nations, we 
will not ratify it. That passed 95 to 0. 
Every Senator voted that way, and it 
was very clear. So I think one can say 
with that commitment at least in the 
United States that Kyoto is dead. 

Kyoto goes into force on February 16. 
According to the European Union Environmental 
Ministry, most EU member 
states will not meet their Kyoto targets. 
That is kind of interesting because 
the very people who are behind it 
and are so adamant that, yes, we must 
do this, are the ones who have not met 
their voluntary targets and have no 
real intention of doing so. They may do 
so only on paper due to Russia’s ratification 
of the treaty. 

Russia, of course, ratified Kyoto not 
because its government believes in catastrophic 
global warming—it does 
not—but because ratification was Russia’s 
key to joining the World Trade 
Organization. Also, under Kyoto, Russia 
can profit from selling emission 
credits to the European Union and continue 
business as usual without undertaking 
economically harmful emissions 
reductions. 

Just stop and think about this now. 
We are talking about the huge, massive 
country of Russia. I have been active in 
aviation for 48 years now, and I had occasion 
a few years ago to fly an airplane 
around the world, replicating the 
flight of Wiley Post. In doing so, I went 
all the way across Siberia. I can remember 
going not just hour after hour 
but time zone after time zone, seeing 
no signs of civilization, just great forests. 
Well, they ended up getting credits 
for all of that. When I talked to the 


S20 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 2005 

Russian people last year in Milan, 
Italy, they were very straightforward, 
saying: No, there is no science to it, 
but we stand to make millions of dollars 
if we sign on to this thing. 

That was my first indication that 
they were going to do so. 

So as the talks in Buenos Aires revealed, 
if alarmists cannot get what 
they want at the negotiating table, 
they will try other means. I was told 
by reliable sources that some delegation 
members of the European Union 
suddenly hinted that America’s rejection 
of Kyoto could be grounds for a 
challenge under WTO. I surely hope 
this was just a hypothetical suggestion 
and not something our European 
friends are actively and seriously considering. 
I predict such a move would 
be devastating to the United States 
and the United States-European Union 
relations, not to mention the WTO 
itself. 

I suspect it is not just hypothetical. 
The lawsuit is the stock and trade of 
environmental activists. We are witnessing 
a new crop of global warming 
lawsuits now being leveled at individual 
U.S. companies and at the 
United States itself. 

In Buenos Aires, Earth Justice, a San 
Francisco-based environmental group, 
and the Center for International Law 
announced plans to seek a ruling from 
the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights that the U.S., because of 
its supposed contribution to global 
warming, is causing environmental 
degradation in the Arctic and therefore 
violating the human rights of Alaska’s 
Inuits, or Eskimos. As the New York 
Times wrote: 

The commission, an investigative arm of 
the Organization of American States, has no 
enforcement powers. But a declaration that 
the United States has violated the Inuits’ 
rights could create the foundation for an 
eventual lawsuit, either against the United 
States in an international court or against 
American companies in a U.S. court, said a 
number of legal experts, including some 
aligned with industry. 

The Times did not mention that such 
lawsuits already have been filed with 
the U.S. 

Eliot Spitzer, New York’s State attorney 
general, along with eight other 
State attorneys general, mainly from 
the Northeast, last year sued five coal 
burning electric utilities in the Midwest. 
The reason: ‘‘Given that these are 
among the largest carbon dioxide polluters 
in the world,’’ Mr. Spitzer wrote, 
‘‘it is essential that the court direct 
them to reduce their emissions.’’ 

To me, this is a clear-cut sign of desperation 
by the alarmists, but I am not 
surprised. President Bush has rejected 
Kyoto. The Senate has rejected Kyoto 
95 to 0. The Senate rejected the 
McCain-Lieberman bill by 55 to 43, and 
there is little hope that Congress will 
pass mandatory greenhouse gas reduction, 
at least not in the near future. So 
resorting to the courts is their last 
hope. I hope the courts have enough 
sense in moderation to reject these 
lawsuits out of hand. 

I am interested, for one, to see how 
Mr. Spitzer quantifies with scientific 
precision just how these particular 
companies have contributed to climate 
change. How is it, one might ask, that 
emissions, specifically from American 
Electric Power, are causing rising sea 
levels, droughts, or hurricanes? Such 
efforts fly in the face of compelling 
new scientific evidence that makes a 
mockery of these lawsuits. 

By now most everyone familiar with 
the climate change debate knows about 
the hockey stick graph constructed by 
Dr. Michael Mann and his colleagues 
which shows that temperatures in the 
Northern Hemisphere remained relatively 
stable over 900 years and then 
spiked upward in the 20th century. The 
hockey stick graph was featured 
prominently in IPCC’s third assessment 
report published in 2001. The conclusion 
inferred from the hockey stick 
is that industrialization, which 
spawned widespread use of fossil fuels, 
is causing the planet to warm. 

I spent considerable time examining 
this work in my 2003 speech because 
Dr. Michael Mann effectively erased 
the well-known phenomena of the medieval 
warming period. In other words, 
he never even recognized—I wish we 
had the chart because I have a chart 
that shows this, and one can see the 
shaft of the hockey stick over 900 years 
go like this, but all of a sudden in the 
20th century it starts up like this, and 
they failed to realize that there was 
another blade in the hockey stick that 
was the medieval warming period 
where the temperatures were warmer 
than they are today. This has been 
going on since creation. I think the 
fact that he did it—I was challenged in 
a speech that I made in Italy on this 
subject. I said I believe Michael Mann 
must have intentionally left that off 
because that completely destroys the 
credibility of his findings. 

But don’t take my word for it. Just 
ask Dr. Hans Von Storch, a noted German 
climate researcher, who, along 
with colleagues, published a devastating 
finding in the Sept. 30, 2004 
issue of Science magazine. As the authors 
wrote: ‘‘We were able to show in 
a publication in Science that this 
[hockey stick] graph contains assumptions 
that are not permissible. Methodologically 
it is wrong: Rubbish.’’ 

Dr. Von Storch and colleagues discovered 
that the Mann hockey stick 
had severely underestimated past climate 
variability. In a commentary on 
Dr. von Storch’s paper, T.J. Osborn and 

K.R. Briffa, prominent paleoclimatologists 
from the University of East 
Anglia, stressed the importance of the 
findings. As they wrote, ‘‘The message 
of the study by von Storch et al. is that 
existing reconstructions of the NH 
[northern hemisphere] temperature of 
recent centuries may systematically 
underestimate the true centennial variability 
of climate’’ . . . and, ‘‘If the 
true natural variability of NH [northern 
hemisphere] temperature is indeed 
greater than is currently accepted, the 
extent to which recent warming can be 
viewed as ‘unusual’ would need to be 
reassessed.’’ In other words, in obliterating 
the Medieval Warm Period and 
the Little Ice Age, Mann’s hockey 
stick just doesn’t pass muster. 

Dr. Von Storch is one of many critics 
of Michael Mann’s hockey stick. To recount 
just one example, three geophysicists 
from the University of Utah, 
in the April 7, 2004 issue of Geophysical 
Research Letters, concluded that 
Mann’s methods used to create his 
temperature reconstruction were deeply 
flawed. In fact, their judgment is 
harsher than that. As they wrote, 
Mann’s results are ‘‘based on using end 
points in computing changes in an oscillating 
series’’ and are ‘‘just bad 
science.’’ I repeat: ‘‘just bad science.’’ 

As to the arctic climate assessment, 
these findings, alongside a spate of new 
reports, at least in the eyes of the 
media supposedly confirm the ‘‘consensus’’ 
on global warming. ‘‘The Arctic 
Climate Impact Assessment,’’ released 
last fall, perfectly fits that 
mold. ‘‘Arctic Perils Seen in Warming,’’ 
blared a headline by the New 
York Times. As the Times wrote: ‘‘The 
findings support the broad but politically 
controversial scientific consensus 
that global warming is caused mainly 
by rising atmosphere concentrations of 
heat-trapping greenhouse gases, and 
that the Arctic is the first region to 
feel its effects.’’ 

What do we really know about temperatures 
in the Arctic? Let’s take a 
closer look. As Oregon State University 
climatologist George Taylor has 
shown, Arctic temperatures are actually 
slightly cooler today than they 
were in the 1930s. As Dr. Taylor has explained, 
it’s all relative—in other 
words, it depends on the specific time 
period chosen in making temperature 
comparisons. The Arctic Climate Impact 
Assessment, Dr. Taylor wrote: 
‘‘appears to be guilty of selective use of 
data. Many of the trends described in 
the document begin in the 1960s or 
1970s—cool decades in much of the 
world—and end in the warmer 1990s or 
early 2000s. So, for example, temperatures 
have warmed in the last 40 years, 
and the implication, ‘if present trends 
continue,’ is that massive warming will 
occur in the next century.’’ 

Dr. Taylor concluded this way: ‘‘Yet 
data are readily available for the 1930s 
and early 1940s, when temperatures 
were comparable to (and probably higher 
than) those observed today. Why not 
start the trend there? Because there is 
no net warming over the last 65 years? 

This is pretty convincing stuff. But, 
one might say, this is only one scientist, 
while nearly 300 scientists in 
several countries, including the United 
States, signed onto the Arctic report. I 
want to submit for the record a list of 
scientists, compiled by the Center For 
Science and Public Policy, from several 
countries, including the United 
States, whose published work shows 
current Arctic temperature is no higher 
than temperatures in 1930s and 1940s. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S21 

For example, according to a group of 7 
scientists in a 2003 issue of the Journal 
of Climate: ‘‘In contrast to the global 
and hemispheric temperature, the maritime 
Arctic temperature was higher in 
the late 1930s through the early 1940s 
than in the 1990s.’’ Or how about this 
excerpt from the 2000 International 
Journal of Climatology, by Dr. 
Rajmund Przybylak, of Nicholas Copernicus 
University, in Torun, Poland: 
‘‘The highest temperatures since the 
beginning of instrumental observation 
occcured clearly in the 1930s and can be 
attributed to changes in atmospheric 
circulation.’’ 

I ask unanimous consent the list of 
scientists be printed in the RECORD at 
the conclusion of my remarks. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 

objection, it is so ordered. 

[See exhibit 1.] 

Mr. INHOFE. Despite this evidence, 
alarmism is live and well. As you can 
see behind me, the Washington Post 
today ran an editorial cartoon that, 
yes, actually blames the Sumatra tsunami 
on global warming. Are we to believe 
now that global warming is causing 
earthquakes? The tsunami, of 
course, was caused by an earthquake 
off Sumatra’s coast deep beneath the 
sea floor, completely disconnected 
from whatever the climate was doing 
at the surface. Regrettably, the tsunami-
warming connection merely confirms 
the state of fear extremists are 
so eager to create. As Terence Corcoran 
of Canada’s Financial Post 
wrote: ‘‘The urge to capitalize on the 
horror in Asia is just too great for 
some to resist if it might help their 
cause . . . Green Web sites are already 
filling up with references to tsunami 
risks associated with global warming.’’ 

There is something inhumane about 
that, that they would capitalize on the 
tragedy of a hundred thousand people 
to push a hoax like global warming. 

To address this, let’s ask some simple 
questions: Is global warming causing 
more extreme weather events of greater 
intensity, and is it causing sea levels 
to rise? The answer to all of these is 
emphatically no. Just look at this 
chart behind me. It’s titled ‘‘Climate 
Related Disasters in Asia: 1900 to 
1990s.’’ What does it show? It shows the 
number of such disasters in Asia, and 
the deaths attributed to them, declining 
fairly sharply over the last 30 
years. 

Let’s take hurricanes. Alarmists 
linked last year’s hurricanes that devastated 
parts of Florida to global 
warming. But this is patently false. 
Credible meteorologists were quick to 
dismiss such claims. Hugh Willoughby, 
senior scientist at the International 
Hurricane Research Center of Florida 
International University stated Plainly: 
‘‘This isn’t a global-warming sort of 
thing. . . It’s a natural cycle,’’ A team 
led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration’s Dr. Christopher 
Landsea concluded that the relationship 
of global temperatures to 
the number of intense land-falling hur


ricanes is either non-existent or very 
weak. In this chart you can see that 
the overall number of hurricanes and 
the number of the strongest hurricanes 
fluctuated greatly during the last century, 
with a great number in the 1940s. 
In fact, through the last decade, the intensity 
of these storms has declined 
somewhat. 

What about sea level rise? Alarmists 
have claimed for years that sea level, 
because of anthropogenic warming, is 
rising rapidly. Based on modeling, the 
IPCC estimated that sea level will rise 

1.8 millimeters annually, or about one-
fourteenth of an inch. 
But in a study published this year in 
Global and Planetary Change, Dr. Nils-
Axel Morner of Sweden found that sea 
level rise hysteria was overblown. In 
his study, which relied not only on observational 
records, but also on satellites 
he concluded that: ‘‘there is a 
total absence of any recent ‘acceleration 
in sea level rise’ as often claimed 
by IPCC and related groups.’’ Yet we 
still hear of a future world overwhelmed 
by floods due to global warming. 
Such claims are completely out of 
touch with science. As Sweden’s 
Morner puts it, ‘‘there is no fear of 
massive future flooding as claimed in 
most global warming scenarios.’’ 

What I have outlined today will not 
appear in the New York Times. Instead 
you will read much about ‘‘consensus’’ 
and Kyoto and hand wringing by its 
editorial writers that unrestricted carbon 
dioxide emissions from the United 
States are harming the planet. You 
will read nothing, of course, about how 
Kyoto-like policies harm Americans, 
especially the poor and minorities, 
causing higher energy prices, reduced 
economic growth, and fewer jobs. After 
all, that is the real purpose behind 
Kyoto, as Morgot Wallstrom, the EU’s 
environment minister, said in a moment 
of candor. To her, Kyoto is about 
‘‘leveling the playing field’’ for businesses 
worldwide—in other words, we 
can’t compete, so let’s use a feel-good 
treaty, based on shoddy science, fear, 
and alarmism, which will have no perceptible 
impact on the environment, to 
restrict America’s economic growth 
and prosperity. Unfortunately for Ms. 
Wallstrom and Kyoto’s staunchest advocates, 
America was wise to the 
scheme, and it has rejected Kyoto and 
similar policies convincingly. Whatever 
Kyoto is about—to some, such as 
French President Jacques Chirac, it’s 
about forming ‘‘an authentic global 
governance’’—it’s the wrong policy and 
it won’t work, as many participants in 
Buenos Aires conceded. 

I recommend—and I will include at 
the end of my remarks—the economic 
study which was done by the Wharton 
School of Economics talking about 
what would happen to America and the 
cost of global warming. If we should 
sign on to Kyoto, what would it cost? 
They go into detail. They talk about 
doubling the price of energy. They talk 
about the price of fuel more than doubling. 


Keep in mind this is the economic 
survey. They talk about the cost to the 
average family of four in America 
being $2,715 a year by 2010. 

People have to understand that the 
economic destruction of our country is 
something that would inure to the benefit 
of the European Union and many 
others who are in competition with us. 
We have to understand that there is an 
economic motive behind it which one 
would have to seriously consider. 

Despite the bias, omissions, and distortions 
by the media and extremist 
groups, the real story about global 
warming is being told and, judging by 
the success of Michael Crichton’s 
‘‘State of Fear,’’ much to the dismay of 
certain groups, it is now being told to 
the American public. 

I think one thing which we all have 
to understand in this body is we have 
to recognize the fact that we have an 
energy crisis in America today. Right 
now, there are a few people around the 
country who are now catching on that 
it is true. We need all forms of energy 
to run this great machine called America. 
Our forms of energy can be nuclear, 
they can be renewable, they can 
be fossil fuel, coal, oil, gas, all of the 
above. It is what we will have to have 
in order to be competitive. 

Chairing the committee and being 
active in the upcoming energy bill, we 
anticipate being realistic in thinking 
about not just ourselves today—not 
just my four kids or my 12 grandchildren 
and future generations—but 
you are going to have to run this most 
successful, highly industrialized machine 
ever conceived in the history of 
the world. And you can’t do it sitting 
around closing the door on all opportunities 
that we have for energy. Certainly 
one is coal. 

Certainly we need to look at this 
whole issue of global warming and 
what the real motives are of these people 
who are behind this. 

I gave a speech on this floor the last 
session and talked about the amount of 
money—I am also going to insert that 
for the RECORD—being paid to elect 
people, money that is being filtered 
through a lot of these organizations. 
There is a lot of money made out there 
by causing people to be fearful, by 
making people afraid, by making people 
feel that the world is coming to an 
end. It is not.

Temporal and spatial variance of surface 
air temperature over the period of instrumental 
observations in the Arctic, International 
Journal of Climatology, 20, 587–614, 
2000. 

KEY QUOTE OR SYNOPSIS 

‘‘A detailed analysis of the spatial and 
temporal changes in mean seasonal and annual 
surface air temperatures over the period 
of instrumental observations in the Arctic 
is presented . . . The presented analysis 


S22 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 2005 

shows that the observed variations in air 
temperature in the real Arctic (defined on 
the basis of climate as opposed to other criteria, 
e.g. astronomical or botanical) are in 
many aspects not consistent with the projected 
climatic changes computed by climatic 
models for the enhanced greenhouse 
effect. The highest temperatures since the 
beginning of instrumental observation occurred 
clearly in the 1930s and can be attributed 
to changes in atmospheric circulation. 
The second phase of contemporary global 
warming (after 1975) is, at most, weakly 
marked in the Arctic. For example, the mean 
rate of warming for the period 1991–1995 was 
2–3 times lower in the Arctic than the global 
average. Temperature levels observed in 
Greenland in the last 10–20 years are similar 
to those observed in the 19th century.’’

KEY QUOTE OR SYNOPSIS 
The researchers present results which show 
that average Arctic temperature undergoes 

large variations, driven by the dominance of 
different internal modes. The most recent 
temperature rise is shown to be related to 
atmospheric circulation factors in the North 
Atlantic Ocean while an early 20th century 
warming of nearly equal magnitude was possibly 
related to long-term sea ice variations. 

TOPIC: RECENT CLIMATE CHANGE IN ALASKA 
As a U.S. Senator, you were rightly concerned 
about the state of the conditions in 
Alaska, and on repeated instances you asked 
for specifics about observed climate changes 
there. On each and every occasion, you only 
received a partial collection of facts about 
historical temperature and temperature 
trends that would lead an interested listener 
to believe that anthropogenic global warming 
was responsible for the large change in 
Alaskan temperatures observed over the past 
30 to 40 years. In fact, a natural climate shift 
in the Pacific Ocean that occurred in 1976 is 
responsible for the observed climate changes 
in Alaska. Below is a list of researchers, 
many from the Alaska Climate Research 
Center at the University of Alaska, who 
could have supplied you with these facts that 
were missing from your hearing:

Temperature Change in Alaska, 1949–2003, 
http://climate.gi.Aaska.edu/ClimTrends/ 
Change/4903Change.html 

KEY QUOTE OR SYNOPSIS 

‘‘The topic of climate change has attracted 
widespread attention in recent years and is 
an issue that numerous scientists study on 
various time and space scales. One thing for 
sure is that the earth’s climate has and will 
continue to change as a result of various 
natural and anthropogenic forcing mechanisms. 


‘‘This page features the trends in mean annual 
and seasonal temperatures for Alaska’s 
first-order observing stations since 1949 (Fig. 
1), the time period for which reliable meteorological 
data are available. The temperature 
change varies from one climatic zone to 
another as well as for different seasons. If a 
linear trend is taken through mean annual 
temperatures, the average change over the 
last 5 decades is about 3.0 °F. However, when 
analyzing the trends for the four seasons, it 
can be seen that most of the change has occurred 
in winter and spring, with less of a 
change in summer and even slight cooling in 
autumn (see Table below). 

‘‘Considering just a linear trend can mask 
some important variability characteristics 
in the time series. Figure 2 shows clearly 
that this trend is non-linear: a linear trend 
might have been expected from the fairly 
steady observed increase of CO2 during this 
time period. The figure shows the temperature 
departure from the long-term mean 
(1949–2003) for the average of all stations. It 
can be seen that there are large variations 
from year to year and the 5-year moving average 
demonstrates cyclical behavior. The 
period 1949 to 1975 was substantially colder 
than the period from 1977 to 2003, however 
since 1977 no additional warming has occurred 
in Alaska with the exception of Barrow 
and a few other locations. In 1976, a 
stepwise shift appears in the temperature 
data, which corresponds to a phase shift of 
the Pacific Decadal Oscillation from a negative 
phase to a positive phase. Synoptic con


ditions with the positive phase tend to consist 
of increased southerly flow and warm air 
advection into Alaska during the winter, resulting 
in positive temperature anomalies.

change after the 1976 shift, and for other 
time periods.’’

shift of 1976 within Alaskan climatology. 
Seventh Conference on Polar Meteorology

on High-Latitude Climate Variations. 
May 12–16, 2003. 

KEY QUOTE OR SYNOPSIS 

‘‘During the year of 1976, the index of the 
PDO [Pacific Decadal Oscillation] underwent 
a shift from one of strongly negative phase 
to one of strongly positive phase. The general 
circulation and temperature differences 
witnessed during each of the phases is generally 
well known, but a fine scale study to 
understand specific climatological effects 
within Alaska, including the differing regional 
effects and responses to the abrupt 
change, has not been conducted. The present 
study is an effort to clearly discern the specific 
manner in which the regime shift was 
experienced throughout Alaska.’’ 

‘‘The magnitude and sudden nature of the 
shift in the PDO Index is paralleled by 
strong local temperature increases in Alaska, 
suggesting that significant local changes 
in other meteorological variables should be 
seen as well . . . 

‘‘[Atmospheric circulation patterns associated 
with the 1976 PDO regime shift] explain 
the immense warming of 10 °C observed in 
January from one decade to the next in the 
Interior, a value far beyond that which can 
be explained by increased CO2 and other

PAPER 

On the significance of the 1976 Pacific climate 
shift in the climatology of Alaska, 
Journal of Climate, under review. 

KEY QUOTE OR SYNOPSIS 

‘‘The 1976 Pacific climate shift is examined 
and its manifestations and significance in 
Alaskan climatology during the last half-
century are demonstrated. The regime shift 
is quantified by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
Index shift in 1976 from dominantly negative 
values for the 25-year time period 1951– 
1975 to dominantly positive values for the period 
1977–2001. 

‘‘Mean annual and seasonal temperatures 
for the positive phase were up to 3.1 °C higher 
than for the negative phase. Likewise, 
mean cloudiness, wind speeds, and precipitation 
amounts increased while mean sea level 
pressure and geopotential heights decreased. 
The pressure decrease resulted in a deepening 
of the Aleutian Low in winter and 
spring. The intensification of the Aleutian 
Low increased the advection of relatively 
warm and moist air to Alaska and storminess 
over the state. 

‘‘The regime shift is also examined for its 
effect on the long-term temperature trends 
throughout the state. The trends that have 
shown climatic warming are strongly biased 
by the sudden shift from the cooler regime to 
a warmer regime in 1976. When analyzing the

total time period from 1951 to 2001, warming 
is observed, however the 25-year period trend 
analyses before 1976 (1951–1975) and thereafter 
(1977–2001) both display cooling. In this paper 
we emphasize the importance of taking into 
account the sudden changes that result from 
abrupt climatic shifts, persistent regimes 
and the possibility of cyclic oscillations, 
such as the PDO, in the analysis of long-
term climate change in Alaska.’’

During your Senate Committee hearing, 
you also heard testimony about the observed

decades and how that in some climate 
model prognostications, summer sea ice totally 
disappears from the northern oceans by 
the end of the 21st century. However, no one 
told you that a large portion of the observed 
sea ice declines is related to natural variability, 
or that in some regions it does not appear 
that current conditions are any more or 
less unusual than sea ice condition during 
the 19th century. Had you invited the scientists 
below to testify, you would have been 
made aware of these opinions.

Response of Sea Ice to the Arctic Oscillation, 
Journal of Climate, 15, 2648–2663, 2002. 

KEY QUOTE OR SYNOPSIS 

‘‘Increased advection of the ice away from 
the coast during winter during high-index 
conditions of the AO [Arctic Oscillation] enhanced 
the production of thin ice in the flaw 
leads of the East Siberian and Laptev Seas. 
The cyclonic SIM [sea ice motion] anomaly 
also enhances the production of thin ice during 
winter because of the increase in divergence 
over the eastern Arctic. Both of these 
processes contribute to thinning of sea ice. 
These changes in SIM have contributed to 
the observed trends in sea ice, such as the 
decreases in ice area and extent, and the 
thinning of sea ice. 

‘‘The changes in SIM also appear to be at 
least partially responsible for the trends in 
SAT [surface air temperature] reported by 
Rigor et al. (2000); that is, the increased latent 
heat released during the formation of 
new ice in the diverging leads, and the increased 
heat flux through thinner ice have 
contributed to the pronounced warming that 
has been observed in the East Siberian and 
Laptev portions of the warm anomaly. Intuitively, 
one might have expected the warming 
trends in SAT to cause the thinning of 
sea ice, but the results presented in this 
study imply the inverse causality; that is, 
the thinning ice has warmed SAT by increasing 
the heat flux from the ocean.’’

‘‘Reports based on submarine sonar data 
have suggested Arctic sea ice has thinned 
nearly by half in recent decades. Such rapid 
thinning is a concern for detection of global 
change and for Arctic regional impacts. Including 
atmospheric time series, ocean currents 
and river runoff into an ocean-ice-snow 
model show that the inferred rapid thinning 
was unlikely. The problem stems from 
undersampling. Varying winds that readily 
redistribute Arctic ice create a recurring 
pattern whereby ice shifts between the central 
Arctic and peripheral regions, especially 
in the Canadian sector. Timing and tracks of 
the submarine surveys missed this dominant 
mode of variability.’’

PAPER 

Arctic Sea Ice Thickness Remained Constant 
during the 1990s. Geophysical Research 
Letters, 28, 1039–1041, 2001. 

KEY QUOTE OR SYNOPSIS 

‘‘The ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is considered 
to be a sensitive indicator of global 
climate change. Recent research, using submarine-
based observations, suggests that the 

Arctic ice cover was thinner in the 1990s 
compared to an earlier period (1958–1979), and 
that it continued to decrease in thickness in 
the 1990s. Here I analyze subsurface ice 
thickness (draft) of Arctic sea ice from six 
submarine cruises from 1991 to 1997. This extensive 
data set shows that there was no 
trend towards a thinning ice cover during 
the 1990s. Data from the North Pole shows a 
slight increase in mean ice thickness, whereas 
the Beaufort Sea shows a small decrease, 
none of which are significant. Transects between 
the two areas from 76 N to 90 N also 
show near constant ice thicknesses, with a 
general spatial decrease from the Pole towards 
the Beaufort Sea. Combining the 
present results with those of an earlier 
study, I conclude that the mean ice thickness 
has remained on a near-constant level 
around the North Pole from 1986 to 1997.’’

KEY QUOTE OR SYNOPSIS 

Vinje constructed a 135-yr time series of 
sea ice extent in the Nordic Seas and found 
that while April sea ice extend has declined 
by about 33 percent during this period, more 
than half of the decline occurred before 1900. 
Vinje concluded that ‘‘the time series indicates 
that we are in a state of continued recovery 
from the cooling effects of the Little 
Ice Age, during which a maximum sea-ice expansion 
was observed around 1800, both in 
the Iceland Sea and the Barents Sea.’’

Arctic decadal and interdecadal variability, 
Geophysical Research Letters, 27,

KEY QUOTE OR SYNOPSIS: 
‘‘The rapid reduction of arctic ice thickness 
in the 1990s may be one manifestation of 
the intense atmosphere and ice cyclonic circulation 
regime due to the synchronous actions 
of the AO [Arctic Oscillation] and LFO 
[low-frequency oscillation]. Our results suggest 
that the decadal AO and multi-decadal 
LFO drive large amplitude natural variability 
in the Arctic making a detection of 
possible long-term trends induced by greenhouse 
gas warming most difficult.’’ 

TOPIC: GREENLAND MELTING 
Another topic one which you heard testimony 
was the rapid melting of Greenland ice 
sheets and their potential contribution to 
rapid global sea level rise. However, none of 
the panelists told you that there has been an 
overall decline in Greenland temperatures 
during the past 60s years, and that despite 
the warming trend in Greenland during the 
last decade or so, temperatures still have not 
reached levels as high there as they were 
during the 1930s and 1940s.

S24 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 2005 

KEY QUOTE OR SYNOPSIS 

‘‘The Greenland surface air temperature 
trends over the past 50 years do not show 
persistent warming, in contrast to global average 
surface air temperatures. The Greenland 
coastal stations temperature trends 
over the second half of the past century generally 
exhibit a cooling tendency with superimposed 
decadal scale oscillations related to 
the NAO. At the Greenland ice sheet summit, 
the temperature record shows a decrease 
in the summer average temperature 
at the rate of about 2.2° C/decade, suggesting 
that the Greenland ice sheet at high elevations 
does not follow the global warming 
trend either. 

‘‘A significant and rapid temperature increase 
was observed at all Greenland stations 
between 1920 and 1930. The average annual 
temperature rose between 2 and 4 °C in 
less than ten years. Since the change in anthropogenic 
production of greenhouses gases 
at that time was considerably lower than 
today, this rapid temperature increase suggests 
a large natural variability of the regional 
climate. 

‘‘High anticorrelations (r = ¥0.84 to ¥0.93) 
between the NAO index and the Greenland 
temperature records suggest a physical link 
between these processes. The recent negative 
shift of the NAO correlates with 1990s warming 
in Greenland. The NAO may play a crucial 
role in determining local Greenland climate 
during the 21st century; resulting in a 
local climate that may defy the global climate 
change. This possibility should be considered 
in models of ice sheet melt and future 
sea level rise. Forecasting changes in 
the NAO may be a primary factor in predicting 
the future Greenland ice sheet mass 
balance.’’

Recent cooling in coastal southern Greenland

KEY QUOTE OR SYNOPSIS 
‘‘Analysis of new data for eight stations in

a significant cooling (trend-line change -1.29 
°C for the 44 years), as do sea-surface temperatures

Sea, in contrast to global warming 
(+0.53 °C over the same period). The land and 
sea temperature series follow similar patterns 
and are strongly correlated but with no 
obvious lead/lag either way. This cooling is 
significantly inversely correlated with an increased 
phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation 
(NAO) over the past few decades (r = 
-0.76), and will probably have significantly 
affected the mass balance of the Greenland

ASIAN TSUNAMI 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
world’s thoughts and prayers continue 

to be focused on the victims of the 
Asian tsunami. The international community, 
including governments, private 
businesses, and ordinary citizens, 
is providing financial aid and material 
assistance to affected countries in that 
region. President Bush and other world 
leaders deserve praise for quickly providing 
substantial assistance and resources 
to disaster response efforts 
across that region. They have brought 
hope and relief in the midst of despair. 

I want to recognize in particular Japan’s 
substantial pledge to ongoing relief 
efforts. As chairman of the Foreign 
Operations Subcommittee, I intend to 
continue to work closely with the administration 
in the days and weeks to 
come to assess damage and provide targeted 
relief. 

Let me close with an observation on 
Burma. Predictably, information on 
the extent of damage in Burma is unknown—
this is the way the Burmese 
junta operates—with the official casualty 
tally placed by the illegitimate 
State Peace and Development Council 
at 59 people. Do international donors, 
regional governments, or humanitarian 
NGOs trust this figure? The simple answer, 
as articulated by Secretary Powell 
earlier today, is we don’t. We don’t 
trust the figure. We don’t have any 
idea how many people either died or 
are suffering in Burma. 

The lack of action or interest in the 
welfare of the people of Burma, by the 
military junta, should not be lost on 
all of the ASEAN members and their 
dialog partners ahead of the SPDC’s 
chairmanship of that organization in 
2006. 

I thank everybody on the ground— 
from personnel at the State Department, 
USAID, and the Department of 
Defense to the dedicated staff of humanitarian 
organizations—for working 
around the clock with respective governments 
in those hard-hit countries. 
Their efforts have not gone unnoticed 
in the Senate. As we move forward 
with this relief effort in the near future, 
our prayers are for those efforts 
that are being made to ease the incalculable 
suffering of the people affected 
by the tsunami. 

I suggest the absence of a quorum. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 

The assistant legislative clerk proceeded 
to call the roll. 

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

TRIBUTE TO DAVID ARMAND 
DEKEYSER 

Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a great American, 
Armand DeKeyser, my chief of 
staff for 8 years, who is going out into 
the commercial world. This is a big 
event for me. It is painful, indeed, to 
lose one with whom I have been so 
closely associated for so long. I have 

known him and worked with him for 
more than 25 years. We met as we 
served together for nearly 10 years in 
the U.S. Army Reserve in Mobile, AL, 
the 1184th Transportation Terminal 
Unit. We went to annual training together 
and became good friends. Armand 
and his wife Beverly had returned 
to Mobile after he completed 
his Active-Duty service with the U.S. 
Army in Germany. He first, after he returned, 
worked in the seafood business, 
Star Fish and Oyster Company, that 
had been in his family for over 80 
years. After another business experience, 
I hired him as a law enforcement 
coordinator when I became U.S. attorney 
for the Southern District of Alabama. 


Perhaps his most important contribution 
there was his leadership for 
the Weed and Seed Program that revitalized 
the Martin Luther King neighborhood 
in Mobile, AL. He helped get 
the citizens of the community together 
and drew up a plan for a neighborhood 
redevelopment program. The city, the 
county, and the Federal Government 
all worked together. He did a superb 
job. 

It was a great success. Today that 
neighborhood is an entirely different 
community than it was in the early 
1990s. I later told him, when they put 
you in the ground, this is one achievement 
you know made the world better. 

In 1994, I was elected attorney general 
of Alabama, and the office was in 
the midst of a funding crisis—and I 
mean crisis; I do not mean a 1, 2, or 3-
percent shortfall. Spending was on 
track to exceed the funds available to 
the office by $5 million, and the budget 
was a $10 million budget. 

I chose Armand to be our administrative 
officer, and his performance was 
superb. Automobiles were sold, all of 
them—virtually all of them. Offsite offices 
were closed. Nonmerit system employees 
were let go. One-third of the office, 
virtually all nonmerit employees, 
had to be terminated—one-third of the 
Office of the Attorney General. The 
workload had to be completely reorganized 
as a result, and Armand’s work 
during that time was nothing short of 
heroic. 

Then in 1996, I was elected to the 
Senate, and I asked him to serve as my 
chief of staff. What a great decision 
that was. He and Beverly agreed to 
come to Washington—after he and I 
lived together and shared an apartment 
together here for a while, a three-story 
walkup—to take on the task of helping 
this new and inexperienced Senator get 
started. 

He worked harder and longer during 
his 8 years than any other employee on 
our staff. He knows people all over our 
State, and they like and trust him. He 
managed so ably we were able to return 
to the U.S. Treasury each year a substantial 
portion of the funds given to 
our office by the Senate. 

Most of all, he helped me and others 
on our staff achieve our best. He subordinated 
himself to serve the office with 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S25 

fidelity, diligence, and integrity. Chief 
of staff is not an easy job, but his gifts 
and graces were a perfect fit. Whether 
he was encouraging young staffers, 
dealing with Governors, generals, administration 
officials, or the many 
constituents who call on us for help, he 
performed superbly. 

His military service, including Active 
Duty and the Army Reserve, was a 
very valuable asset in his service to 
me. In fact, the 1184th, after I got out 
of it, was activated, and he spent almost 
a year in Kuwait as part of Desert 
Storm. He retired after 28 years of 
service with the military at the rank of 
lieutenant colonel. 

The key to Armand’s success and his 
value to our office, I believe, was his 
deep commitment to an America where 
the right thing is done and where there 
is an efficient and lawful process for 
doing the people’s work. He never forgot 
that the money we spend here has 
been extracted from some decent 
American who would otherwise find 
good use for it. Armand believes we 
must be good stewards of that money, 
and that programs and spending are 
only worthwhile if they produce a valuable 
return. He feels passionately 
about this, and our shared values in 
this regard made us a good team, I 
think. 

He has been a superb public servant, 
and by thousands of individual acts of 
accountability, frugality, and integrity—
mostly unnoticed by the press or 
anyone else particularly—he has saved 
the dutiful taxpayers of America tens 
of millions of dollars. When he came to 
Washington, I told him that because of 
my poor abilities, I needed to have the 
best staff we could put together. As a 
result of his leadership, I believe we 
created and have maintained a magnificent 
team, without whose help I 
could not have been successful. 

In addition to his wife Beverly, whom 
I admire so much and with whom he attended 
Murphy High School in Mobile, 
where my daughter attended, and Auburn 
University, he has two fine sons: 
Phillip, a graduate of Georgia Tech and 
now a consulting engineer, and David, 
who commenced as a student at Boston 
College. He is and has every right to be 
extremely proud of them. 

He and Beverly have opened their 
lives and home to my staff throughout 
the years. Serving as a ‘‘home away 
from home’’ for many Alabamians in 
the area and staff people, Armand’s 
house has been the site of holiday and 
office gatherings on numerous occasions. 


Over the years, his ability to make 
the staff feel more like a family has 
earned him the friendship and affection 
of many. Many of our staff, as well as 
their parents, appreciate that. 

I and all our team truly appreciate 
the open-door policy he has had with 
staff and recognize all the work he has 
done to keep things running smoothly 
in the office. 

He has served extraordinarily well 
and faithfully, and it is now appro


priate and just that Armand undertake 
new opportunities. 

While I am sad to see him leave, I 
know he is about to embark on a great 
new career as executive director of the 
Government Relations Group at Kilpatrick 
Stockton, LLP, one of America’s 
finest law firms. I am confident he 
will meet the challenge of the new job 
with the same professionalism and 
dedication he has shown for the past 8 
years as my chief of staff. His years of 
public service may be over for now, but 
his commitment to the Nation and the 
principles on which it was founded will 
never waiver. 

I wish him all the best. I close with 
one final remark close to Armand’s Auburn 
heart: War eagle.

HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES 

LANCE CORPORAL AARON HOLLAND 

Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to 
express my sympathy over the loss of 
Aaron Holland of Columbus, NE, a 
lance corporal in the U.S. Marine 
Corps. Lance Corporal Holland was 
killed in a car accident on December 
17, 2004 near Richfield, UT, while returning 
home to Columbus from his 
second tour of duty in Iraq. He was 21 
years old. 

Lance Corporal Holland graduated 
from Columbus High School and is survived 
by his mother Becky and stepfather 
Paul Knopick; two stepbrothers, 
Silas and Paul Knopick; grandparents, 
Lois and Edmund Mueller; and uncle, 
Mark Mueller; all of Columbus. Our 
thoughts and prayers are with them at 
this difficult time. The United States 
of America is proud of Aaron Holland’s 
service and mourns his loss. 

The 9/11 terrorist attacks on the U.S. 
fostered Holland’s interest in a military 
career and after graduating in 
2002, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine 
Corps. After completing his training, 
he served with the 3rd Marine Aircraft 
Wing stationed at Marine Corps Air 
Station Miramar in San Diego, CA. 
Holland served two tours in Iraq, from 
February to July 2003 and from February 
to August 2004. Lance Corporal 
Holland will be remembered as a loyal 
marine who had a strong sense of duty, 
honor, and love of country. Thousands 
of brave Americans like Lance Corporal 
Holland are currently serving in 
Iraq. 

For his service, bravery and sacrifice, 
I ask my colleagues to join me and all 
Americans in honoring LCpl Aaron 
Holland. 

PRIVATE FIRST CLASS JOSHUA A. RAMSEY 

Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise 
today with a heavy heart and deep 
sense of gratitude to honor the life of a 
brave young man who lived in Marion, 
IN as a child. PFC Joshua Ramsey, 19 
years old, died on December 12 when he 
was shot while carrying out his duties 
in Iraq. With his entire life before him, 
Joshua risked everything to fight for 
the values Americans hold close to our 
hearts, in a land halfway around the 
world. 

After attending Oak Hill Junior High 
School for the eighth grade, Joshua 
moved to Defiance, OH where his father 
and stepmother live. Joshua, a 2003 
graduate of the Four County Career 
Center, left a strong impression not 
only on his classmates but his teachers 
as well. One of his high school teachers, 
Tonya Fisher, shared some memories 
of her former student with the 
Marion Chronicle Tribune saying, ‘‘He 
was a good student and a good classmate. 
He worked really hard in class 
and was really dedicated. He knew he 
wanted to go to the military...He’s 
very family-oriented. He struggled 
with leaving his family, but he really 
believed in what he was fighting for.’’ 
Joshua’s mother, Joy, recalled her 
son’s bravery during a conversation she 
had with him not long ago. He told her, 
‘‘Mom, I have one of the most dangerous 
jobs in the Army, but I wouldn’t 
have it any other way.’’ 

Joshua was the 42nd Hoosier soldier 
to be killed while serving his country 
in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was assigned 
to the 95th Military Police Battalion, 
Mannheim, Germany. This 
brave young soldier leaves behind his 
mother, Joy; his father, Bruce; and his 
stepmother, LeAnn. 

Today, I join Joshua’s family, his 
friends and the entire Hoosier community 
in mourning his death. While we 
struggle to bear our sorrow over this 
loss, we can also take pride in the example 
he set, bravely fighting to make 
the world a safer place. It is his courage 
and strength of character that people 
will remember when they think of 
Joshua, a memory that will burn 
brightly during these continuing days 
of conflict and grief. 

Joshua was known for his dedication 
to others and his love of family and 
country. When looking back on Joshua’s 
life, his grandmother, Margaret, 
told the Marion Chronicle Tribune that 
he had loved golf, was on the wrestling 
team and ran track. Today and always, 
Joshua will be remembered by family 
members, friends and fellow Hoosiers 
as a true American hero and we honor 
the sacrifice he made while dutifully 
serving his country. 

As I search for words to do justice in 
honoring Joshua’s sacrifice, I am reminded 
of President Lincoln’s remarks 
as he addressed the families of the fallen 
soldiers in Gettysburg: ‘‘We cannot 
dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we 
cannot hallow this ground. The brave 
men, living and dead, who struggled 
here, have consecrated it, far above our 
poor power to add or detract. The 
world will little note nor long remember 
what we say here, but it can never 
forget what they did here.’’ This statement 
is just as true today as it was 
nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain 
that the impact of Joshua’s actions 
will live on far longer than any record 
of these words. 

It is my sad duty to enter the name 
of Joshua Ramsey in the official record 
of the United States Senate for his 


S26 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 2005 

service to this country and for his profound 
commitment to freedom, democracy 
and peace. When I think about 
this just cause in which we are engaged, 
and the unfortunate pain that 
comes with the loss of our heroes, I 
hope that families like Joshua’s can 
find comfort in the words of the prophet 
Isaiah who said, ‘‘He will swallow up 
death in victory; and the Lord God will 
wipe away tears from off all faces.’’ 

May God grant strength and peace to 
those who mourn, and may God be with 
all of you, as I know He is with Joshua.

LOSS OF FORMER CONGRESS


WOMAN SHIRLEY CHISOLM AND 

CONGRESSMAN ROBERT MATSUI 

Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, this 
week, our Nation suffered the loss of 
two of the finest Americans to grace 
the public stage in my life time. 

Congressman MATSUI and I served 
here together, and as a result of our 
passionate efforts to preserve and protect 
Social Security, and from leading 
our respective caucus’s campaign efforts 
last year, BOB and I became 
friends. 

BOB was a man of strong beliefs and 
principles and a tireless advocate for 
children, women, minorities, seniors 
and virtually every segment of society 
that too often has been left behind. I 
am saddened by his passing and my 
heart goes out to his family, friends 
and constituents. 

Those of us who knew BOB are richer 
for the experience, and the institution 
of Congress is poorer now that he is 
gone. 

Shirley Chisholm too was a woman of 
strong belief and character. I am deeply 
saddened by her death and my 
thoughts and prayers are with her family. 


When Shirley Chisholm was elected 
the first African-American woman to 
Congress in 1968 America was in the 
midst of dramatic change. Congresswoman 
Chisholm’s refusal to be labeled 
or marginalized by what she called ‘‘a 
small group of old men’’ in Washington 
challenged the status quo and changed 
America for the better. Her barrier-
breaking run for the 1972 Democratic 
Presidential nomination represented 
the best qualities of our democracy. 
Her unique friendships, bi-partisan 
style and staunch advocacy for the people 
she represented are a lesson to us 
all. She will be missed. 

f 

ROTARY CENTENNIAL 
Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we 
begin a new year and a new Congress, 
more than 1.2 million Rotarians in 166 
countries are beginning the centennial 
celebration of Rotary International. 
On February 23, 1905, the Rotary Club 
of Chicago was formed by Paul P. Harris, 
an attorney who wanted to recapture 
the friendly spirit of small-town 
America in a big-city professional club. 
The new group took its name from the 
practice of rotating club meetings 
among members’ offices. 

Rotary quickly grew, with clubs 
forming across the country and around 
the world. At the same time, the organization’s 
interests expanded from social 
and professional interests to community 
service. 

Along with public service, Rotary has 
given the world a high standard of ethics 
known as the 4-Way Test. This test 
asks the following four questions of the 
things we think, say, or do: 

1. Is it the truth? 
2. Is it fair to all concerned? 
3. Will it build goodwill and better 
friendships? 
4. Will it be beneficial to all concerned? 
During and after World War II, Rotary 
International became deeply involved 
in efforts to promote global 
peace and understanding. Rotary members 
actively supported the founding of 
the United Nations and helped to establish 
UNESCO, the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural 
Organization. 

In recent years, Rotary International 
has helped communities around the 
world to address some of the critical 
needs of our day, including disease, 
hunger, illiteracy, environmental degradation, 
and children at risk. Rotary 
has been the lead organization in 
PolioPlus, a global effort to immunize 
all the world’s children against polio. 

On the occasion of the Rotary Centennial, 
I send my sincere appreciation 
and best wishes to Rotary International 
and Rotarians everywhere.

MAD COW DISEASE 
Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in today’s 
Federal Register, the United States Department 
of Agriculture has published 
a final rule that could have significant 
adverse impacts on our domestic cattle 
industry. The regulation I am referring 
to designates Canada as a ‘‘minimal 
risk region’’ for BSE, known as mad 
cow disease, and allows Canada to export 
more beef and beef products to the 
United States. 
I understand the desire of the administration 
to work with Canada, and I 
know how frustrated Canadian cattlemen 
are with the current situation. It 
is the same frustration my Montana 
cattlemen feel, as they watch Australia 
and New Zealand expand market share 
in the Pacific Rim, while those markets 
remain closed off to the U.S. But 
this rule has some significant problems, 
and to the extent that those 
flaws could harm domestic consumer 
confidence and the reopening of international 
markets, I’m not going to support 
the administration’s decision to 
open the U.S.-Canadian border to increased 
Canadian exports. 
As I am sure everyone recalls, in May 
2003, Canada discovered a case of BSE 
in Alberta. To protect the safety of 
America’s food supply, USDA banned 
all imports of Canadian beef. In December 
of that same year, a Canadian-born 
dairy cow in Washington State with 
BSE was discovered and so we have the 

cow that stole Christmas. Important 
export markets around the world 
closed their doors to U.S. beef, the 
highest quality beef in the world. 
USDA then instituted a rapid screening 
pilot program to test random cattle 
samples for BSE. To date, the United 
States thankfully has never had a case 
of BSE in a U.S.-born cow. 

Since BSE jumped to the forefront of 
the cattle industry in 2003, USDA has 
been working with other nations, such 
as Japan and Korea, to reopen markets 
to U.S. beef. In October 2004, Japan 
agreed in principle to begin accepting 

U.S. beef and beef products from cattle 
under 20 months of age. While that 
agreement represents an important 
step forward, exports have not yet 
started because of scientific and technical 
obstacles. I remain optimistic 
that exports will begin this spring, and 
would be very concerned about any decisions 
that could jeopardize our relationship 
with Japan. 
In addition to negotiating the resumption 
of U.S. exports, USDA has 
also been working with Canada to resume 
imports of Canadian beef. USDA 
began accepting Canadian boneless beef 
from cattle under 30 months of age in 
August 2003. In October 2003, USDA 
first proposed designating Canada as a 
minimal risk region, but after the December 
2003 discovery of BSE, the rule 
was delayed. With the exception of a 
few incidents, that trade has generally 
been uneventful, and has had little impact 
on U.S. cattle prices. Most importantly, 
consumer confidence in the 
food supply remains strong. 

But today I fear USDA has gone too 
far. 

The rule published in today’s Federal 
Register, which takes effect on March 
7, will allow Canada to export to the 
United States live cattle under 30 
months of age for feeding or immediate 
slaughter; sheep and goats under 12 
months of age for feeding or immediate 
slaughter; meat from cattle, sheep, 
goats and cervids—deer, elk, caribou, 
moose and reindeer; and certain other 
products and byproducts, including bovine 
livers and tongues, gelatin, and 
tallow. Feeder cattle must be branded 
to indicate country of origin, must 
have an eartag so we can trace back to 
the premises of origin, and must be 
slaughtered before reaching 30 months 
of age. The identification requirements 
must be preserved only to the point of 
slaughter, not carried through to the 
retail level. Cattle designed for immediate 
slaughter must move as a group 
in a sealed container to the facility and 
must be slaughtered as a group. 

As I said, this regulation has some 
significant problems, most notably, 
Canada’s enforcement of its feed ban 
and the decision to allow beef and beef 
products from cattle slaughtered at 
any age. USDA needs to withdraw this 
rule now and fix these problems. 

USDA asserts that Canada has high 
levels of compliance with its feed ban, 
but fails to provide the hard data that 
supports that finding. In fact, USDA’s 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S27 

own risk assessment states that in 2002, 
8 percent of feed mills were not in compliance 
with the feed ban. This indicates 
that feed contamination is a recent 
issue, rather than a concern taken 
care of years ago. 

Even more surprisingly, the risk 
analysis states that the fact that no 
cases of BSE have been found in animals 
born after the feed ban is evidence 
that the feed ban is working. USDA 
claims that this rule is based only on 
science, but that is hardly a scientific 
assessment. It could just as likely be 
evidence that Canada is not testing 
enough samples in its rapid screening 
process. Montana ranchers are not 
going to rest easy based on these findings. 


On Dec. 17, the Vancouver Sun ran an 
article indicating that nearly 60 percent 
of Canadian feed contains 
‘‘undeclared animal parts’’, but that 
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, 
CFIA, decided not to use DNA testing 
to determine if the feed is contaminated 
with cattle materials. While the 
presence of animal parts does not necessarily 
indicate feed ban violations, 
Canada should be willing to take necessary 
steps to reassure the United 
States, as well as its own cattle producers, 
that the feed is not contaminated. 
Failing to act represents a lack 
of commitment to enforcing the feed 
ban, in contrast to the effectiveness 
that USDA is willing to presume. Industry 
sources quoted in that article 
expressed concern about conflicting 
messages from CFIA, yet USDA seems 
quite willing to rely on CFIA representations 
for its scientific assessments. 

Similarly, the decision to allow beef 
and beef products from cattle slaughtered 
at any age is troubling. These 
products are likely to contain animals 
born before Canada’s 7-year feed ban. 
While USDA seems certain that Canada 
can safeguard against contaminated 
beef, the rule provides little evidence 
to support that claim. In fact, USDA 
clearly admits that beef products could 
contain animals that have consumed 
contaminated feed, but brushes off the 
risk as ‘‘low.’’ Let me repeat—I am certain 
of the safety of the U.S. food supply. 
However, I remain concerned that 
USDA has not fully evaluated the impact 
on consumer confidence of resuming 
Canadian imports. 

In its risk assessments, USDA seems 
most focused on preventing a BSE epidemic. 
A look at the past year shows 
that just one case—even the suspicion 
of a case—can throw the cattle markets 
into a tailspin. One single, non-native 
occurrence of BSE in the United 
States resulted in dozens of export 
markets closing to U.S. cattle producers. 
The economic and psychological 
impact of BSE needs to factor 
into USDA’s analysis. Cattlemen need 
to be able to trust their markets, and 
consumers need to be able to trust 
their food. 

If exports to Japan have not resumed 
by March, then Montana ranchers will 
be in the unacceptable position of hav


ing to compete domestically against 
Canadian beef flowing through three 
Montana ports without having the option 
of exporting our products to other 
markets. In fact, given concerns already 
expressed by key export markets 
about Canadian beef, the decision to 
allow expanded Canadian imports could 
prevent those same markets from accepting 
U.S. beef. I cannot accept this 
outcome. 

I have often said that I support free 
trade, as long as it is fair trade. Right 
now, the situation facing Montana cattle 
producers is anything but fair. I 
urge USDA to reconsider some of the 
provisions of this regulation, to ensure 
that Canadian beef coming into the 

U.S. does not adversely impact the domestic 
cattle industry. There must be 
independent assessments of Canada’s 
enforcement of its food ban. The 30– 
month limitation on beef and beef 
products deserves another look. Like 
many folks back home, I am anxious 
for the Japanese market to reopen and 
do not want anything to stand in the 
way. We must do what’s right for the 
U.S. cattle industry first.

OBSTRUCTION OF BIPARTISAN 
COPYRIGHT BILLS 

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the 
waning days, weeks and months of the 
108th Congress, my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle were working hard to 
pass important bipartisan legislation 
that would have protected America’s 
innovators and artists, made more 
spectrum available for broadband services, 
enhanced 911 services, and fixed a 
technical glitch that was threatening 
the Universal Service Fund. Unfortunately, 
others were apparently working 
just as hard to obstruct these measures. 
This obstruction was intended 
only to force the Senate into passing 
legislation that everyone knew was 
doomed in the House. It was a flawed 
plan that was destined to fail. And fail 
it did, but not before it also prevented 
enactment of critically important and 
bipartisan intellectual property legislation. 


The Family Entertainment and 
Copyright Act will go down as a victim 
of this obstructionism. This was an 
uncontroversial intellectual property 
bill that would have protected the 
rights of those who lead the United 
States’ intellectual property industry. 
That industry makes the United States 
the global leader in innovation, and it 
deserves our support. Protecting these 
individuals from the theft of their 
work appeared to mean little to some 
of my colleagues. A Republican plan to 
hijack this important legislation, 
which lasted until the very last moment 
of the 108th Congress, ensured 
that it would not pass in time for the 
House to take it up and pass it. They 
succeeded in preventing the bicameral 
passage of the most important intellectual 
property legislation before the 
Congress this year. This was wrong. 

The Family Entertainment and 
Copyright Act of 2004 contained impor


tant and uncontroversial measures. 
The ART Act, a bill that passed the Judiciary 
Committee and then the full 
Senate by unanimous consent, would 
have provided new tools in the fight 
against bootleg copies of movies 
snatched from the big screen by 
camcorders smuggled into theaters. 
And it would have adopted a creative 
solution developed by the Copyright 
Office to address the growing problem 
of piracy of pre-release works. The 
Film Preservation Act would have 
helped ensure that the Library of Congress 
is able to continue its important 
work in archiving our nation’s fading 
film heritage. Some of America’s oldest 
films—works that document who 
we were as a people in the beginning of 
the 20th Century—are literally disintegrating 
faster than they can be saved. 
The Preservation of Orphan Works bill 
would have allowed greater access to 
certain works in the last years of their 
copyright term. The Fraudulent Online 
Identity Sanctions Act would have protected 
against online trademark infringement 
by prohibiting the use of 
fraudulent Internet addresses to commit 
such infringement. Finally, FECA 
would have clarified that services allowing 
home viewers of prerecorded 
movies to skip objectionable content 
does not violate the copyright laws. 
Obstructionism from certain Republicans 
has ensured that all of these 
problems are left unresolved by the 
108th Congress. 

Thankfully, two provisions of this 
bill were able to pass as stand alone 
bills. Thanks to the hard work of Senator 
BIDEN, the House version of critical 
anti-counterfeiting legislation 
passed. Unfortunately, additional language 
on which Senator BIDEN worked 
tirelessly was passed too late for House 
action. Again, the Republican obstruction 
was at work and to blame. The Cooperative 
Research and Technology Enhancement 
Act also passed both 
houses, largely because a Senate 
version had passed earlier in the year, 
and the Republican obstructionists in 
the Senate could not subvert that bill. 

There is other legislation that has 
fallen to this ill-conceived plan to hijack 
popular legislation. The bipartisan 
Junk Fax bill would have protected 
both consumers and many industries, 
by placing reasonable limits 
on senders of unsolicited faxes. That 
bill, too, was passed too late for House 
action on account of the Republican 
roadblock. 

Thankfully, at the last minute, another 
important and bipartisan piece of 
legislation was allowed through the 
roadblock. The telecommunications 
package contained critically important 
provisions that will enhance 911 service, 
allow spectrum reallocation, and 
preserve the ability of the Universal 
Service Fund to do its important work. 
These are not controversial or partisan 
provisions. E911 will ensure that first 
responders can provide an essential 
public service. The spectrum reallocation 
trust fund will free more space for 


S28 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 2005 

wireless broadband services. This will 
help the American economy by promoting 
jobs and education. The Universal 
Service Fund provision will fix 
an accounting glitch that if left unattended 
will seriously impede the USF 
as it goes about its critical work. 
Again, these uncontroversial provisions 
were held up and almost failed 
because of this obstructionism. 

All of these bills were hijacked and 
sidetracked, in order to coerce the passage 
of a bill that everyone knew would 
not pass the House. I am thankful that 
the telecommunications legislation 
was eventually able to pass, but what 
does it mean that the telecommunications 
bill became law, while the intellectual 
property bill is left unfinished? 
It seems those responsible for 
this obstruction do not take the needs 
of America’s innovative leaders very 
seriously. That attitude will undermine 
the American economy, and 
threaten America’s leadership in the 
creative industries. So, because of this 
Republican roadblock, America’s 
innovators and artists will have to 
struggle through more uncertainty, 
without the tools they need to defend 
their rights. That is a shame.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 

HONORING THE NORTHERN STATE 

MARCHING WOLVES 
S Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I publicly 
congratulate the Northern State 
University Marching Wolves on being 
selected to march in the Presidential 
Inaugural Parade on January 20, 2005. 
Northern State University has been an 
integral part of Aberdeen, SD, for the 
past century. The Marching Wolves 
were founded by Harvey Moen in 1941 
and have represented Northern State 
University well for the past six decades. 
Today they are led by Dr. Alan 
LaFave, the Director of Bands at 
Northern State University, and Mr. 
Boyd Perkins, the Director of the 
Marching Wolves. 

The tradition of the Inaugural Parade 
is as old as the office of the President; 
as George Washington traveled 
from Mount Vernon to New York for 
his swearing in, militia members began 
to walk behind him, joined by government 
officials and Members of Congress 
once he arrived in New York on 
April 30, 1789. In 1801 Thomas Jefferson 
was the first President to be Inaugurated 
in Washington, DC, and Members 
of Congress and citizens walked with 
him from the Capitol to the White 
House to music played by the Marine 
Band. The Marine Band has played in 
the Inaugural Parade every year since. 

Though this will be the first time the 
Marching Wolves will participate in 
the Inaugural Parade, they have performed 
previously at professional football 
games and regional marching band 
competitions. The band is comprised of 
125–130 students, making it one of the 
largest student groups at Northern 

State University. They rehearse daily 
during football season, and their members 
show great dedication to this remarkable 
organization. The band rehearses 
5 days a week for an hour and 
a half during the fall semester. In order 
to prepare for the parade, they will be 
practicing an additional 3 days and 2 
nights before the spring semester begins. 
The Marching Wolves have a 
great tradition of leadership within 
their band which has served them well. 

It is an honor to be chosen to perform 
in the Presidential Inaugural Parade, 
and I am proud to have the 
Northern State University Marching 
Wolves representing South Dakota. It 
is no surprise that an organization 
with the passion and dedication of the 
Marching Wolves was chosen for this 
privilege. It is with great honor that I 
share this impressive accomplishment 
with my colleagues.S

RECOGNITION OF COLORADO’S 

PROFESSORS OF THE YEAR 
S Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish 
to congratulate Robert von Dassanowsky 
and Carl Wieman for being selected 
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement 
of Teaching and the Council 
for Advancement of Support Education 
as this year’s U.S. Professors of the 
Year. 

Robert von Dassanowsky, Ph.D., is 
associate professor and chair of Languages 
and Cultures and director of 
Film Studies at the University of Colorado, 
Colorado Springs. A widely published 
literary and film historian, Dr. 
Dassanowsky is founding VP of the 
Austrian American Film Association, 
which promotes scholarly and production 
activities between the two nations. 


Carl Wieman, Ph.D., is a physicist at 
the University of Colorado at Boulder. 
In 2001, Dr. Wieman was honored with 
the Nobel Prize in Physics. He gives approximately 
60 talks a year on the 
topic of physics research and science 
education. 

This recognition represents the culmination 
of a great deal of hard work 
and determined effort. It acknowledges 
their dedication to teaching and commitment 
to students. They should be 
very proud of this honor. 

Now more than ever, our Nation 
needs the skills and talents of college 
professors like Robert von 
Dassanowsky and Carl Wieman. They 
understand the importance of a well-
rounded college education for students 
if we are to produce the next generation 
of leaders. We are very grateful for 
all they do to make a difference. Their 
effort is greatly appreciated. 

Congratulations again to two of Colorado’s 
outstanding citizens.S

Mr. THUNE, Mr. VITTER, Mr. VOINOVICH, 
Mr. WARNER, and Mr. WYDEN) submitted 
the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 

S. RES. 4 
Whereas on December 26, 2004, a tremendous 
earthquake, registered at 9.0 on the 
Richter scale and centered 100 miles off the 
coast of Northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered 
a deadly tsunami that swept throughout 
the Indian Ocean and beyond, devastating 
cities, towns, and communities, and 
killing or injuring persons in Southeast Asia 
and South Asia, through the island nations 
of the region, to Eastern Africa; 

Whereas, as a result of the earthquake and 
ensuing tsunami, more than 140,000 people 
have lost their lives to date, tens of thousands 
of people are injured or missing, and 
the final death toll could climb into the hundreds 
of thousands; 

Whereas the victims also include thousands 
of nationals who were visiting the region 
when the tsunami hit, including significant 
numbers from Europe and North and 
South America; 

Whereas millions of people throughout 
Southeast Asia and South Asia have been 
left without food, shelter, or clean water, 
and now face deadly diseases such as cholera, 
dengue fever, dysentery, malaria, and typhoid; 


Whereas thousands of children have been 
killed or injured by this disaster; 

Whereas, as a result of this tragedy, thousands 
of children have been separated from 
their families or orphaned and are in need of 
re-unification or adoption; 

Whereas whole coastal communities and 
cities throughout the region were obliterated; 


Whereas recovery, reconstruction, and 
clean-up of the devastated areas likely will 
take years, billions of dollars, and the concerted 
leadership of the United States working 
together with the international community; 


Whereas the people of the United States 
immediately responded and expressed their 
sympathy and concern by sending financial 
aid and other assistance currently totaling 
more than $100,000,000, through nongovernmental 
organizations and other means, to 
the victims of this disaster, and by offering 
to volunteer in the disaster rescue, recovery, 
and rebuilding; 

Whereas soon after the earthquake and 
tsunami hit the region, the United States 
Government expressed its condolences and 
invoked six disaster declarations for the nations 
hardest hit by this natural disaster, 
thus triggering the release of emergency 
funding to these countries; 

Whereas less than 24 hours after these 
tragedies became known, the United States 
announced an initial pledge of $15,000,000 for 
emergency humanitarian assistance, which 
was increased to $35,000,000 in the following 
days as the scope of the tragedy unfolded; 

Whereas President George W. Bush also 
dispatched more than 20 United States military 
cargo and patrol aircraft, redirected a 
Marine expeditionary unit and a carrier task 
force, and deployed several hundred United 
States military personnel to the region to 
assist with the disaster response, recovery, 
and delivery of relief supplies; 

Whereas, in response to an early appeal by 
the International Federation of the Red 
Cross and Red Crescent for $7,500,000, the 
United States provided $4,000,000 for the distribution 
of emergency shelter materials and 
other relief commodities, and provided more 
than 3,000 metric tons of rice to the United 
Nations World Food Program for use in the 
affected region; 

Whereas President George W. Bush has established 
a regional core group with Australia, 
Canada, India, Japan, and the Netherlands, 
with the United Nations, to help coordinate 
relief efforts, and sent a senior delegation 
of experts, led by Secretary of State 
Colin Powell and Florida Governor Jeb Bush, 
to meet with regional leaders and international 
organizations to assess what additional 
aid can be provided by the United 
States; 

Whereas on December 31, 2004, President 
Bush increased the United States pledge to 
$350,000,000 in aid and stated that the United 
States’ contributions to disaster relief and 
recovery ‘‘will continue to be revised as the 


S30 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE January 4, 2005 

full effects of this terrible tragedy become 
clearer’’; 

Whereas pledges of assistance from all 
international organizations, multilateral development 
banks, and governments, including 
the United States, now exceed 
$2,000,000,000; and 

Whereas, on January 3, 2005, the President 
appointed former Presidents George H. W. 
Bush and Bill Clinton to lead a nationwide 
charitable fund-raising effort to elicit greater 
relief and assistance to the victims of the 
powerful earthquake and devastating tsunami: 
Now, therefore, be it 

Resolved, That the Senate— 

(1) expresses its heartfelt sympathy for the 
victims of the powerful earthquake and devastating 
tsunami that struck cities, towns, 
and communities throughout Southeast 
Asia, South Asia, Eastern Africa, and the region 
on December 26, 2004; 
(2) conveys its most sincere condolences to 
the families, communities, and governments 
of the more than 140,000 people that lost 
their lives in this terrible natural disaster; 
(3) expresses its gratitude and respect for 
the courageous and committed work of all 
aid and relief personnel, including United 
States military personnel, who are saving 
lives and providing relief assistance in the 
devastated areas of the region; 
(4) supports President George W. Bush’s 
pledge of $350,000,000 in direct financial assistance, 
and tens of millions of dollars in 
additional indirect assistance through the 
dispatch of United States military aircraft, 
naval vessels, and personnel, and through 
the United States Government’s substantial 
voluntary and annual contributions to international 
organizations and bodies; 
(5) commends the ongoing international relief 
effort that includes the work of individual 
countries, numerous international organizations, 
and various relief and other 
nongovernmental entities; 
(6) reaffirms that the United States Government 
is committed to providing relief and 
assistance in the most effective and efficient 
means possible, and will continue to assess, 
anticipate, and provide further assistance as 
needed in the weeks and months ahead; 
(7) recognizes that the support of the 
United States Government will be greatly 
supplemented by private donations and assistance 
from thousands of United States 
citizens, charitable organizations, religious 
groups, and corporations that routinely provide 
generous and significant amounts of aid, 
support, and volunteers; and 

(8) fully supports the long-term commitment 
and engagement of the United States 
to provide financial aid and other forms of 
direct and indirect assistance to the countries 
and peoples of the region impacted by 
the powerful earthquake and the devastating 
tsunami.

PROGRAM 
Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on Thursday 
morning the Senate will be in 
morning business, and at 12:50 p.m. the 
Senate will proceed as a body to the 
House of Representatives for a joint 
session for the counting of electoral 
votes. Members should gather in the 
Senate Chamber at 12:40 so that we 
may leave promptly at 12:50. 
During Thursday’s session, we expect 
to act on the committee resolution. 
Members are wondering about roll-
call votes for the week. At this point, 
it is unclear, but we will notify all 
Members if a rollcall vote is possible 
before we finish our business this week. 
Following close of business on Thursday, 
the Senate will adjourn until January 
20. 
I inform my colleagues that when the 
Senate reconvenes January 20, we will 
immediately begin work on the President’s 
nominations. 
I will simply close by saying that we 
have had a remarkable day today. Six 
hours ago we began the swearing in of 
34 Senators. It is always a moving time 
to have family, friends, spouses, and 
constituents from so many different 
States coming to Washington, DC, to 
share in an occasion that we all remember—
indelibly printed on our 

minds—when we put our right hand in 
the air and took that oath to this body 
and to that Constitution. It has been a 
remarkable day for people. It has been 
a great pleasure for us in leadership to 
be able to participate really on the periphery 
as we celebrate with each and 
every one of them for their great public 
service. 

f 

ADJOURNMENT UNTIL THURSDAY, 
JANUARY 6, 2005, AT 9:30 A.M. 

Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, if there is 
no further business to come before the 
Senate, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate stand in adjournment under 
the previous order. 

There being no objection, the Senate, 
at 5:53 p.m., adjourned until Thursday, 
January 6, 2005, at 9:30 a.m.

EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS 

136TH AIRLIFT WING, TEXAS NA


TIONAL GUARD FAMILY READI


NESS TEAM 

HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor a dedicated group of individuals who 
have devoted their time and energy to supporting 
our brave soldiers—136th Airlift Wing, 
Texas National Guard Family Readiness 
Team. 

The Family Readiness Team’s mission is to 
assist units as they support the families of 
members of the 136th Airlift Wing during 
peacetime and times of training or mobilization. 
The Team provides multiple levels of 
care and assistance. They send a personal 
greeting card to any member upon request; 
establish and facilitate ongoing communication, 
involvement, support, and recognition between 
National Guard families and the National 
Guard in a partnership that promotes 
the best in both; and provide all Air Force families 
assistance and support before; during and 
after times of local or national emergencies/ 
disasters, mobilization, deployment/separation 
or evacuation. The Family Readiness Team 
has a Chaplain’s Staff available to comfort and 
encourage hope for the families of our deployed 
troops as well as those troops providing 
home station sustainment. 

My son was a member of the Texas Air National 
Guard, and I have found that working 
with the Family Readiness Team, located in 
Fort Worth, Texas, has been rewarding. There 
are opportunities for family members to assist 
their loved ones by attending meetings on 
base and promoting fellowship with other families. 
The Texas Air National Guard Family 
Readiness Team is part of a National Guard 
Family Program which works to connect people 
across America. I applaud the great work 
of the 136th Airlift Wing Family Readiness 
Team, and I look forward to continuing and 
supporting this organization in the years to 
come.

DELIVERING HIGH-QUALITY CARE 
TO VETERANS 

HON. BERNARD SANDERS 

OF VERMONT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to 
rise in praise of the White River Junction Veterans 
Administration Medical Center, which 
has received the Robert W. Carey Trophy 
Award for Organizational Excellence. This 
award, named after a former Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs, was presented to recognize the 
truly excellent care that the White River VA 
Center provides to veterans in Vermont and 
the Connecticut River Valley. This award is 

the highest quality award the Department of 
Veterans Affairs can bestow. 

In the two previous years, the White River 
VA Center was recognized for excellence for 
the quality of its care by winning back-to-back 
Carey Achievement Awards. This year it took 
the top award in the nation. 

Under the leadership of Gary De Gasta, the 
staff at the center—doctors, nurses, health 
professionals, administrative support—are 
committed to providing the very best in health 
care. They are attentive to veterans and their 
needs; they offer state-of-the art medical care; 
they honor the service of the brave men and 
women who answered, and answer, our nation’s 
call decade after decade. 

I am very proud of the excellent work done 
by those who work at the White River VA 
Center. They are deserving of this highest of 
commendations, and we in Vermont are very 
proud of them. We are equally proud that this 
high level of performance helps to deliver the 
very best in health care to our veterans.

INTRODUCING THE PARENTAL 
CONSENT ACT 

HON. RON PAUL 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce 
the Parental Consent Act. This bill forbids 
Federal funds from being used for any universal 
or mandatory mental-health screening 
of students without the express, written, voluntary, 
informed consent of their parents or 
legal guardians. This bill protects the fundamental 
right of parents to direct and control 
the upbringing and education of their children. 

The New Freedom Commission on Mental 
Health has recommended that the Federal and 
State Governments work toward the implementation 
of a comprehensive system of mental-
health screening for all Americans. The 
commission recommends that universal or 
mandatory mental-health screening first be implemented 
in public schools as a prelude to 
expanding it to the general public. However, 
neither the commission’s report nor any related 
mental-health screening proposal requires 
parental consent before a child is subjected 
to mental-health screening. Federally-
funded universal or mandatory mental health 
screening in schools without parental consent 
could lead to labeling more children as ‘‘ADD’’ 
or ‘‘hyperactive’’ and thus force more children 
to take psychotropic drugs, such as Ritalin, 
against their parents’ wishes. 

Already, too many children are suffering 
from being prescribed psychotropic drugs for 
nothing more than children’s typical rambunctious 
behavior. According to the Journal of the 
American Medical Association, there was a 
300-percent increase in psychotropic drug use 
in two- to four-year-old children from 1991 to 
1995. 

Many children have suffered harmful side 
effects from using psychotropic drugs. Some 

of the possible side effects include mania, violence, 
dependence, and weight gain. Yet, parents 
are already being threatened with child 
abuse charges if they resist efforts to drug 
their children. 

Imagine how much easier it will be to drug 
children against their parents’ wishes if a fed-
erally-funded mental-health screener makes 
the recommendation. 

Universal or mandatory mental-health 
screening could also provide a justification for 
stigmatizing children from families that support 
traditional values. Even the authors of mental-
health diagnosis manuals admit that mental-
health diagnoses are subjective and based on 
social constructions. Therefore, it is all too 
easy for a psychiatrist to label a person’s disagreement 
with the psychiatrist’s political beliefs 
a mental disorder. For example, a federally-
funded school violence prevention program 
lists ‘‘intolerance’’ as a mental problem 
that may lead to school violence. Because ‘‘intolerance’’ 
is often a code word for believing in 
traditional values, children who share their 
parents’ values could be labeled as having 
mental problems and a risk of causing violence. 
If the mandatory mental-health screening 
program applies to adults, everyone who 
believes in traditional values could have his or 
her beliefs stigmatized as a sign of a mental 
disorder. Taxpayer dollars should not support 
programs that may label those who adhere to 
traditional values as having a ‘‘mental disorder.’’ 


Mr. Speaker, universal or mandatory mental-
health screening threatens to undermine 
parents’ right to raise their children as the parents 
see fit. Forced mental-health screening 
could also endanger the health of children by 
leading to more children being improperly 
placed on psychotropic drugs, such as Ritalin, 
or stigmatized as ‘‘mentally ill’’ or a risk of 
causing violence because they adhere to traditional 
values. Congress has a responsibility to 
the nation’s parents and children to stop this 
from happening. I, therefore, urge my colleagues 
to cosponsor the Parental Consent 
Act.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘‘PRO USE 
ACT’’ 

HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to announce the introduction of the ‘‘PRO USE 
Act.’’ As we all know, copyrighted works not 
only provide entertainment and provide a positive 
trade balance for our country’s economy 
but also are a window to this country’s cultural 
heritage. In recognition of this, our copyright 
laws are designed to encourage the production, 
distribution, and preservation of copyrighted 
content. This legislation, which I am introducing 
with Representative HOWARD L. BERMAN, 
makes two important changes to the

E2 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 2005 

copyright law to make it easier to preserve 
these artifacts. 

Title I is the ‘‘Preservation of Orphan Works 
Act.’’ This important provision corrects an 
oversight in the copyright law that allows libraries 
and archives to reproduce and distribute 
up to three copies of musical works, 
movies, etc.—not sound recordings—of a copy 
they have to replace stolen/deteriorated copies 
or for preservation/security purposes. They 
also can make unlimited copies of other copyrighted 
works—items except musical works, 
movies, etc.—during the last 20 years of the 
copyright term. This bill would amend the law 
to say they can make unlimited copies of musical 
works, movies, etc. during the last 20 
years of the term of the music or movies. 

Title II is the ‘‘National Film Preservation Act 
of 2005.’’ It reauthorizes the National Film 
Preservation Act of 1996. We all know that 
motion pictures are amongst this nation’s cultural 
treasures, going beyond entertainment to 
represent American ideals and values to people 
across the world. Unfortunately, the films 
on which many motion pictures are created 
are easily susceptible to physical deterioration; 
in fact, over 50 percent of movies made before 
1950 have deteriorated and over 90 percent 
of movies from before 1929 have disintegrated. 


The 1996 Act was designed to ensure that 
we could protect the treasures we still have. It 
created the National Film Preservation Board 
and the National Film Preservation Foundation. 
The NFPB generates public awareness of 
a national film registry and reviews initiatives 
to ensure the preservation valued films. The 
NFPF issues grants to libraries and other institutions 
that can save films from degradation. 

The program has received accolades from 
organizations such as the Directors Guild of 
America and the Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts and Sciences. Noted filmmakers Martin 
Scorsese and Ken Burns also have praised 
the NFPB and the NFPF. 

Unfortunately, the program officially expired 
October 11, 2003, and was not reauthorized. 
The legislation being introduced today would 
remedy that oversight by reauthorizing both 
the NFPB and the NFPF. I hope my colleagues 
will join me in supporting this valuable 
effort as we move it through the House.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF OFFICER PETER LAVERY 

HON. JOHN B. LARSON 

OF CONNECTICUT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and service of Officer 
Peter Lavery of the Newington Police Department 
in Connecticut, who was tragically 
shot and killed in the line of duty on December 
30, 2004, as he responded to an emergency 
call. 

It was a terrible day for the people of Connecticut 
as one of our finest public servants 
was cut down in the prime of his life. Officer 
Lavery was a dedicated 17-year veteran of the 
Newington Police Department, and had served 
his Nation proudly as a member of the Connecticut 
National Guard. He was known for his 
‘‘big golden heart’’ and sense of humor, and 
so many of my constituents will never forget 

the important role he played in their lives or in 
the communities he served. He leaves behind 
his wife, Pamela, and two children, Raymond 
and Samantha, to whom our hearts go out 
during this difficult time. 

We struggle to understand why such a horrific 
act of violence was visited upon such a 
good and decent man who loved his family 
and served his community. In the end, there 
are no answers. 

Today, as thousands of his neighbors and 
fellow officers gather in Newington to honor 
the life and service of Officer Lavery, we must 
remind ourselves of the thousands of brave, 
dedicated men and women that put their lives 
in danger each day to protect us and our families. 
Officer Lavery made the ultimate sacrifice 
in the name of this cause. He will not be forgotten. 


May God bless him, his family and the 
United States of America.

IN HONOR OF MR. AND MRS. 
JAMES ‘‘CLYDE’’ SHAHAN 

HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to a couple, like so many others in 
our nation, which was truly American: Mr. and 
Mrs. James ‘‘Clyde’’ Shahan. 

Mr. Shahan, known to his friends as Clyde, 
and his four brothers, all from Denton, Texas, 
served in the United States Army during World 
War II. Clyde served honorably in New Guinea 
and Luzon, receiving numerous citations and 
decorations including the Asiatic Pacific Campaign 
Medal with 2 Bronze Stars, Philippine 
Liberation Ribbon with 1 Bronze Star, Good 
Conduct Medal, Victory Ribbon, 1 Service 
Stripe and 4 Overseas Service Bars. 

After his discharge, Mr. Shahan returned to 
the Denton area where he, along with his 
Aural, became active members at Lake Cities 
United Methodist Church in Lake Dallas, 
Texas. Aural and Clyde worked side by side at 
several school districts and serving their community. 


Mr. and Mrs. Shahan had a son, Bobby Joe, 
who died as a three year old in a flu epidemic, 
but neither of them lost their faith or their commitment 
to education and their country. Remembered 
as a happy and funny man, Clyde 
often attended church in his finest Western 
suit and was always a joy at church functions. 

Almost two years to the day of his wife’s 
death, Clyde passed away in 2004. Today, I 
honor the memory of these two individuals 
who impacted a community with hope. I am 
pleased that their memories will not be lost as 
a special memorial is being established at 
Lake Cities United Methodist Church in their 
honor. Truly, Clyde and Aural were members 
of the ‘‘greatest generation’’ and will be remembered 
always for their commitment to 
Christ and America. 

TEN YEARS OF STELLAR SERVICE 

HON. BERNARD SANDERS 

OF VERMONT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. Speaker, ten years ago 
the Howard Center for Human Services was 
established. It is a remarkable organization, 
one which provides essential services to the 
citizens of four counties in northern Vermont. 
Although its origins are in the nineteenth century, 
its earliest forebearer was a ladies’ aid 
and relief society in 1873. Its willingness to 
join together several different NGOs in 1994, 
overriding several smaller portfolios in the interest 
of providing a broad umbrella of services 
to the community, is testimony to its commitment 
to serving the needs of Vermont. 

The focus of its staff and programs is on developmental 
disabilities, those with mental 
problems, and on children, youth and families 
who face difficulties of many sorts. It serves 
those in crisis and those with ongoing problems. 
Altogether, the Howard Center serves 
over 15,000 Vermont residents each year 
through Howard Community Services, the 
Baird Center, and Adult Behavioral Health 
Services. It does so efficiently, dedicating almost 
90 percent of its budget directly to programs 
and outreach for those thousands of 
Vermonters in need of the services it provides. 

The Howard Center provides accredited 
services in the areas of mental health, alcohol 
and other drug addictions programs, family 
services, and employment services. Its many 
programs range from crisis intervention and 
stabilization to outpatient treatment, case management 
services coordination, community 
housing, residential treatment, job development 
and supports, and criminal justice service 
case management. In addition to a dedicated 
staff and hundreds of contracted workers 
supporting individuals and families in their 
homes and in the community, 500 volunteers 
help the Howard Center meet the needs of our 
friends and neighbors in northern Vermont. 

I could go on at length about the individual 
programs of the Howard Center, but in the interest 
of time I will mention just one, one that 
is representative of the remarkable commitment 
and innovation that the Howard Center 
brings to providing human services to northern 
Vermont. The Streetwork program provides 
daily assistance and support to people with 
psychiatric disabilities, and to those dealing 
with substance abuse, homelessness and 
other unmet social service needs; it provides 
those services on the main streets of downtown 
Burlington, by going out to people rather 
than waiting for them to come into offices or 
clinics. 

In these difficult times, when the middle 
class is under siege and shrinking and low income 
families see the social safety net in 
shreds, when fringe benefits for many jobs 
axe disappearing and more people are medically 
uninsured, when low and moderate income 
housing is often unavailable, the Howard 
Center provides a bulwark and a refuge to 
those who are in need of social services. I 
congratulate them on the past ten years, and 
look forward to a new decade in which they 
continue to sustain tens of thousands of 
Vermonters. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E3 

INTRODUCING THE IDENTITY 
THEFT PREVENTION ACT 

HON. RON PAUL 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, today I introduce 
the Identity Theft Prevention Act. This act protects 
the American people from government-
mandated uniform identifiers that facilitate private 
crime as well as the abuse of liberty. The 
major provision of the Identity Theft Prevention 
Act halts the practice of using the Social Security 
number as an identifier by requiring the 
Social Security Administration to issue all 
Americans new Social Security numbers within 
5 years after the enactment of the bill. These 
new numbers will be the sole legal property of 
the recipient, and the Social Security administration 
shall be forbidden to divulge the numbers 
for any purposes not related to Social 
Security administration. Social Security numbers 
issued before implementation of this bill 
shall no longer be considered valid Federal 
identifiers. Of course, the Social Security Administration 
shall be able to use an individual’s 
original Social Security number to ensure efficient 
administration of the Social Security system. 


Mr. Speaker, Congress has a moral responsibility 
to address this problem because it was 
Congress that transformed the Social Security 
number into a national identifier. Thanks to 
Congress, today no American can get a job, 
open a bank account, get a professional license, 
or even get a driver’s license without 
presenting his Social Security number. So 
widespread has the use of the Social Security 
number become that a member of my staff 
had to produce a Social Security number in 
order to get a fishing license. 

One of the most disturbing abuses of the 
Social Security number is the congressionally 
authorized rule forcing parents to get a Social 
Security number for their newborn children in 
order to claim the children as dependents. 
Forcing parents to register their children with 
the State is more like something out of the 
nightmares of George Orwell than the dreams 
of a free republic that inspired this Nation’s 
Founders. 

Congressionally mandated use of the Social 
Security number as an identifier facilitates the 
horrendous crime of identity theft. Thanks to 
Congress, an unscrupulous person may simply 
obtain someone’s Social Security number 
in order to access that person’s bank accounts, 
credit cards, and other financial assets. 
Many Americans have lost their life savings 
and had their credit destroyed as a result 
of identity theft. Yet the Federal Government 
continues to encourage such crimes by mandating 
use of the Social Security number as a 
uniform ID. 

This act also forbids the Federal Government 
from creating national ID cards or establishing 
any identifiers for the purpose of investigating, 
monitoring, overseeing, or regulating 
private transactions among American citizens. 
At the very end of the 108th Congress, this 
body established a de facto national ID card 
with a provision buried in the ‘‘intelligence’’ reform 
bill mandating Federal standards for drivers’ 
licenses, and mandating that Federal 
agents only accept a license that conforms to 
these standards as a valid ID. 

Nationalizing standards for drivers’ licenses 
and birth certificates creates a national ID system 
pure and simple. Proponents of the national 
ID understand that the public remains 
wary of the scheme, so proponents attempt to 
claim they are merely creating new standards 
for existing State IDs. However, the ‘‘intelligence’’ 
reform legislation imposed Federal 
standards in a Federal bill, thus creating a federalized 
ID regardless of whether the ID itself 
is still stamped with the name of your State. 
It is just a matter of time until those who 
refuse to carry the new licenses will be denied 
the ability to drive or board an airplane. Domestic 
travel restrictions are the hallmark of 
authoritarian States, not free republics. 

The national ID will be used to track the 
movements of American citizens, not just terrorists. 
Subjecting every citizen to surveillance 
diverts resources away from tracking and apprehending 
terrorists in favor of needless 
snooping on innocent Americans. This is what 
happened with ‘‘suspicious activity reports’’ required 
by the Bank Secrecy Act. Thanks to 
BSA mandates, Federal officials are forced to 
waste countless hours snooping through the 
private financial transactions of innocent 
Americans merely because those transactions 
exceeded $10,000. 

The Identity Theft Prevention Act repeals 
those sections of Federal law creating the national 
ID, as well as those sections of the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act of 1996 that require the Department of 
Health and Human Services to establish a uniform 
standard health identifier—an identifier 
which could be used to create a national database 
containing the medical history of all 
Americans. As an OB/GYN with more than 30 
years in private practice, I know the importance 
of preserving the sanctity of the physician-
patient relationship. Oftentimes, effective 
treatment depends on a patient’s ability to 
place absolute trust in his or her doctor. What 
will happen to that trust when patients know 
that any and all information given to their doctors 
will be placed in a government accessible 
database? 

By putting an end to government-mandated 
uniform IDs, the Identity Theft Prevention Act 
will prevent millions of Americans from having 
their liberty, property, and privacy violated by 
private and public sector criminals. 

In addition to forbidding the Federal Government 
from creating national identifiers, this 
legislation forbids the Federal Government 
from blackmailing States into adopting uniform 
standard identifiers by withholding Federal 
funds. One of the most onerous practices of 
Congress is the use of Federal funds illegitimately 
taken from the American people to 
bribe States into obeying Federal dictates. 

Some Members of Congress will claim that 
the Federal Government needs the power to 
monitor Americans in order to allow the government 
to operate more efficiently. I would 
remind my colleagues that, in a constitutional 
republic, the people are never asked to sacrifice 
their liberties to make the jobs of government 
officials easier. We are here to protect 
the freedom of the American people, not to 
make privacy invasion more efficient. 

Mr. Speaker, while I do not question the sincerity 
of those Members who suggest that 
Congress can ensure that citizens’ rights are 
protected through legislation restricting access 
to personal information, the only effective privacy 
protection is to forbid the Federal Gov


ernment from mandating national identifiers. 
Legislative ‘‘privacy protections’’ are inadequate 
to protect the liberty of Americans for 
a couple of reasons. 

First, it is simply common sense that repealing 
those Federal laws that promote identity 
theft is more effective in protecting the public 
than expanding the power of the Federal police 
force. Federal punishment of identity 
thieves provides cold comfort to those who 
have suffered financial losses and the destruction 
of their good reputations as a result of 
identity theft. 

Federal laws are not only ineffective in stopping 
private criminals, but these laws have not 
even stopped unscrupulous government officials 
from accessing personal information. 
After all, laws purporting to restrict the use of 
personal information did not stop the well-publicized 
violations of privacy by IRS officials or 
the FBI abuses of the Clinton and Nixon administrations. 


In one of the most infamous cases of identity 
theft, thousands of active-duty soldiers and 
veterans had their personal information stolen, 
putting them at risk of identity theft. Imagine 
the dangers if thieves are able to obtain the 
universal identifier, and other personal information, 
of millions of Americans simply by 
breaking, or hacking, into one government facility 
or one government database? 

Second, the Federal Government has been 
creating proprietary interests in private information 
for certain State-favored special interests. 
Perhaps the most outrageous example of 
phony privacy protection is the ‘‘medical privacy’’’ 
regulation, that allows medical researchers, 
certain business interests, and law 
enforcement officials access to health care information, 
in complete disregard of the Fifth 
Amendment and the wishes of individual patients! 
Obviously, ‘‘privacy protection’’ laws 
have proven greatly inadequate to protect personal 
information when the government is the 
one seeking the information. 

Any action short of repealing laws authorizing 
privacy violations is insufficient primarily 
because the Federal Government lacks constitutional 
authority to force citizens to adopt a 
universal identifier for health care, employment, 
or any other reason. Any Federal action 
that oversteps constitutional limitations violates 
liberty because it ratifies the principle that the 
Federal Government, not the Constitution, is 
the ultimate judge of its own jurisdiction over 
the people. The only effective protection of the 
rights of citizens is for Congress to follow 
Thomas Jefferson’s advice and ‘‘bind (the 
Federal Government) down with the chains of 
the Constitution.’’ 

Mr. Speaker, those members who are not 
persuaded by the moral and constitutional reasons 
for embracing the Identity Theft Prevention 
Act should consider the American people’s 
opposition to national identifiers. The numerous 
complaints over the ever-growing uses 
of the Social Security number show that Americans 
want Congress to stop invading their privacy. 
Furthermore, according to a survey by 
the Gallup company, 91 percent of the American 
people oppose forcing Americans to obtain 
a universal health ID. 

In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I once again call 
on my colleagues to join me in putting an end 
to the Federal Government’s unconstitutional 
use of national identifiers to monitor the actions 
of private citizens. National identifiers 
threaten all Americans by exposing them to 


E4 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 2005 

the threat of identity theft by private criminals 
and abuse of their liberties by public criminals, 
while diverting valuable law enforcement resources 
away from addressing real threats to 
public safety. In addition, national identifiers 
are incompatible with a limited, constitutional 
government. I, therefore, hope my colleagues 
will join my efforts to protect the freedom of 
their constituents by supporting the Identity 
Theft Prevention Act.

INTRODUCTION OF AN AMENDMENT 
TO THE CONSTITUTION 
PROVIDING THAT FOREIGN-BORN 
CITIZENS OF 20 YEARS ARE ELIGIBLE 
FOR THE OFFICE OF 
PRESIDENT 

HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing 
a proposed amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States that will enable 
all citizens of this country to be eligible to hold 
the Office of President. No citizen should be 
denied the opportunity to seek the Nation’s 
highest office. The proposal that I am introducing 
will allow foreign-born individuals who 
have been citizens of this country for at least 
20 years to be eligible for this office. 

As you know, Article II of the Constitution of 
the United States provides that only natural-
born citizens are entitled to hold the Office of 
President. I believe that this limitation contradicts 
the principles for which this country 
stands. This Nation prides itself on its diversity 
of culture, experience, and opinion. This quality 
is achieved only by welcoming immigrants 
to this country, allowing them to become citizens, 
and enabling them make full contributions 
to society. 

For the most part, the United States treats 
its citizens, those natural-born and foreign-
born, the same. However, when determining 
who is eligible for the Offices of President, this 
country unfairly distinguishes between the two. 
Allowing the United States to be a better 
country because of the contributions that for-
eign-born citizens make, and then not allowing 
them to fully participate in all aspects of society, 
is un-American. 

As you may also know, some of our country’s 
foreign-born citizens are our country’s 
greatest public servants. There are also 700 
foreign-born citizens who have received the 
Medal of Honor. It is unjust to deny citizens 
that have risked their lives for this country the 
chance to become President of the United 
States as well. A 2002 Pentagon study reports 
that more than 30,000 foreign-born citizens 
are currently serving in the U.S. military. 

I realize that constitutional amendments are 
rare and that those proposed should be subject 
to great scrutiny. I truly respect one of the 
documents on which our country was founded, 
the Constitution of the United States. Therefore, 
it is after great consideration and with the 
utmost gravity, that I introduce this proposal 
today. I am hopeful that my fellow colleagues 
in Congress will properly consider the proposed 
amendment and realize that every citizen 
of the United States should be entitled to 
dream of becoming President. 

HONORING THE LIFE OF PATRICIA 

RITTER 

HON. JOHN B. LARSON 

OF CONNECTICUT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Patricia Ritter, who 
passed away on December 10, 2004. Mrs. Ritter 
was one of Connecticut’s most influential 
civil rights leaders and she leaves a legacy 
that will not soon be forgotten. Her passion for 
social justice was only matched by her passion 
for her family. She leaves behind her 
husband and five children, two of whom 
served in the Connecticut General Assembly. 
While I served as State Senate President Pro 
Tempore I had the privilege of working with 
her son Tom, who served as Speaker of the 
House. My deepest condolences go out to 
Tom and his family during this time. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in remembering and honoring the life of Patricia 
Ritter. I would also like to submit for the 
RECORD this editorial from the Hartford Courant 
which captures the essence of what made 
Mrs. Ritter such a special person. 

[From the Hartford Courant, Dec. 14, 2004] 
THE REMARKABLE PAT RITTER 
She stood for something. She acted on her 
beliefs. She changed things. 
Patricia Ritter, who died last week at the 
age of 84, was an activist, civil rights pioneer, 
internationalist and teacher as well as 
the wife and mother of three state legislators. 
A woman of grace, good cheer and quiet intensity, 
Mrs. Ritter was exposed to, and appalled 
by, a segregated restaurant when she 
was a 16-year-old freshman at the University 
of Iowa. She organized a protest and then 
headed South with the first of the Freedom 
Riders—traveling in the odious ‘‘Colored 
Only’’ train cars, and refusing to move. 
After marrying and moving to Connecticut, 
she was named to the state’s Commission 
on Human Rights in 1950, the first 
woman so honored. Facing the problem of 
segregated housing, she and her husband 
George co-founded the Connecticut Housing 
Investment Fund, Inc. in 1968 to finance integrated 
and affordable housing and neighborhood 
revitalization projects throughout Connecticut. 
This allowed racial minorities to buy 
homes in the suburbs, which sometimes 
brought threats of violence and, on at least 
one occasion, actual violence to Mrs. Ritter. 
To date, CHIF has provided more than $108 
million to help individuals and organizations 
purchase, rehabilitate or build homes for 
low- and moderate-income families. 
The wall between city and suburb was not 
the only one she helped tear down. After 
China opened its doors to the West in the 
1970s, Mrs. Ritter founded China in Connecticut, 
one of the first educational links 
between this country and China. 
A college teacher, she spent a decade 
teaching English at Chinese universities, and 
sponsored many of her Chinese students to 
study at U.S. colleges. Several of Mrs. Ritter’s 
children followed her example and 
taught in China as well. The results of such 
work are incalculable. Mrs. Ritter’s five children 
carried on her beliefs; as artists, writers, 
teachers, businessmen and legislators. 
Her husband and sons Thomas and John 
served in the General Assembly; Thomas was 
speaker of the House for three terms. 
‘‘Her integrity, her character, her work, 
her children—she was just a marvelous per


son,’’ said Judge Robert Satter, a longtime 
family friend. Mrs. Ritter’s life affirms the 
proposition that, yes, one person can make a 
difference.

CONGRATULATIONS TO NOLAN 

CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL, STATE 

FOOTBALL CHAMPIONS 

HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the superior performance of the 
Nolan Catholic High School football team, The 
Vikings, on their State Championship for 
Texas Association of Private and Parochial 
Schools Division 1 6A. 

The Vikings shut out Houston St. Pius X 
high school for the championship with a 14–0 
score at Floyd Casey Stadium, Baylor University, 
in Waco, TX, on Saturday November 27, 
2004. The championship victory marked the 
8th time this season the Vikings shut out their 
opponent. This is the first trip to the state final 
in nine years for the Vikings, who have never 
won a State crown. 

I extend my sincere congratulations to 
Brother Richard Thompson, S.M., principal of 
Nolan Catholic High School, the coaches and 
especially to the team for their talent and dedication 
to excellence.

VERMONT FOODBANK FIGHTS 
HUNGER 

HON. BERNARD SANDERS 

OF VERMONT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. Speaker, even though 
this is the richest and most productive nation 
in the history of the world, hunger is still a 
major problem in the United States. In my 
State of Vermont alone, 55,000 households 
are living in poverty. In Vermont, many of 
these people find that the existence of food 
shelves provides the final protection to keep 
them from sinking into malnutrition and even 
starvation. Of those who go to food shelves, 
almost one out of four is elderly and over half 
are families with children. Most of these are 
working families. It is a terrible fact that 21,000 
children under the age of 12 either go hungry 
or are at risk of hunger in Vermont. The situation 
is so severe that nationwide, over 29 percent 
of households that received emergency 
food last year literally had to choose between 
paying for food or paying for medical care. 

Clearly our Nation’s governmental policies 
are entirely wrong, placing as they do tax 
breaks for the wealthy and corporate welfare 
as high priorities, and ignoring the need to 
feed the hungry, guarantee health care to all, 
support the construction of affordable housing, 
and make college available to those who wish 
to attend. We need to change our skewed priorities 
which, rather than to making life better 
and more secure for the vast majority of 
Americans, lead to the increasing gap between 
rich and poor, and to ever-increasing 
economic pressures faced by the middle 
class. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E5 

But while we struggle to change the United 
States, to make it into a more just and equitable 
society, we also need to make sure that 
no American goes hungry. 

I want to commend, today, the Vermont 
Foodbank for its years of exemplary service to 
fighting hunger. The Vermont Foodbank 
serves food shelves, community kitchens, 
homeless shelters, domestic abuse programs 
and programs which provide services for the 
elderly and children. Well over 100,000 people 
are served through Foodbank’s network of 295 
agencies each year. From its building in Barre, 
the Foodbank supplies agencies and NGOs all 
over Vermont with food for those who are hungry. 
It is greatly assisted in its work by hundreds 
of volunteers, who contributed over 
23,000 hours—over 11 years of work weeks— 
in just the past year alone. 

The Vermont Foodbank helps assure that 
none among us go hungry, that every community 
group and agency that seeks to combat 
hunger has a resource upon which it can call. 
It, together with our many community food 
banks, the Vermont Campaign to End Childhood 
Hunger, the work of shelters, the Salvation 
Army, churches, and countless other 
groups, is doing essential, life-sustaining work 
in throughout our State.

INTRODUCING THE SOCIAL SECURITY 
BENEFICIARY TAX REDUCTION 
ACT AND THE SENIOR CITIZENS’ 
TAX ELIMINATION ACT 

HON. RON PAUL 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased 
to introduce two pieces of legislation to reduce 
taxes on senior citizens. The first bill, the Social 
Security Beneficiary Tax Reduction Act, 
repeals the 1993 tax increase on Social Security 
benefits. Repealing this increase on Social 
Security benefits is a good first step toward reducing 
the burden imposed by the federal government 
on senior citizens. However, imposing 
any tax on Social Security benefits is unfair 
and illogical. This is why I am also introducing 
the Senior Citizens’ Tax Elimination Act, which 
repeals all taxes on Social Security benefits. 

Since Social Security benefits are financed 
with tax dollars, taxing these benefits is yet 
another example of double taxation. Furthermore, 
‘‘taxing’’ benefits paid by the government 
is merely an accounting trick, a shell 
game which allows members of Congress to 
reduce benefits by subterfuge. This allows 
Congress to continue using the Social Security 
trust fund as a means of financing other government 
programs, and masks the true size of 
the federal deficit. 

Instead of imposing ridiculous taxes on senior 
citizens, Congress should ensure the integrity 
of the Social Security trust fund by ending 
the practice of using trust fund monies for 
other programs. In order to accomplish this 
goal I introduced the Social Security Preservation 
Act (H.R. 219), which ensures that all 
money in the Social Security trust fund is 
spent solely on Social Security. At a time 
when Congress’ inability to control spending is 
once again threatening the Social Security 
trust fund, the need for this legislation has 
never been greater. When the government 

taxes Americans to fund Social Security, it 
promises the American people that the money 
will be there for them when they retire. Congress 
has a moral obligation to keep that 
promise. 

In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues 
to help free senior citizens from oppressive 
taxation by supporting my Senior Citizens’ 
Tax Elimination Act and my Social Security 
Beneficiary Tax Reduction Act. I also urge 
my colleagues to ensure that moneys from the 
Social Security trust fund are used solely for 
Social Security benefits and not wasted on 
frivolous government programs.

REINTRODUCTION OF H.R. 40, COMMISSION 
TO STUDY REPARATIONS 
PROPOSALS FOR AFRICAN-
AMERICANS ACT 

HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to re-introduce H.R. 40, the Commission to 
Study Reparation Proposals for African-Americans 
Act, along with 22 original cosponsors. 
Since I first introduced H.R. 40 in 1989, we 
have made substantial progress in elevating 
this issue in the national consciousness. 
Through legislation, state and local resolutions, 
and litigation, we are moving closer to a 
full dialogue on the role of slavery in building 
this country. 

Across the nation, three state legislatures: 
Louisiana, California and Florida, have passed 
resolutions supporting H.R. 40. Another three 
states: New Jersey, New York and Texas, 
have legislation pending. At the local level, the 
legislation has gained similar support, with 12 
major cities having passed similar supporting 
resolutions. 

However, despite this progress, the legacy 
of slavery lingers heavily in this nation. While 
we have focused on the social effects of slavery 
and segregation, its continuing economic 
implications have been largely ignored by 
mainstream analysis. These economic issues 
are the root cause of many critical issues in 
the African-American community today, such 
as education, healthcare, and crime. The call 
for reparations represents a commitment to 
entering a constructive dialogue on the role of 
slavery and racism in shaping present-day 
conditions in our community and American society. 


H.R. 40 is designed to create a formal dialogue 
on the issue of reparations through the 
establishment of a national commission to examine 
the institution of slavery. The commission 
will study the impact of slavery and continuing 
discrimination against African-Americans, 
resulting directly and indirectly from 
slavery, during the apartheid of reconstruction, 
desegregation, and the present day. The commission 
would also make recommendations 
concerning any form of apology and compensation 
to begin the long delayed process 
of atonement. 
The issue of reparations remains sensitive 
in many communities because of the basic 
question of money. Statements dismissing 
reparations on the grounds of payment issues, 
however, are completely premature, especially 
when we have not yet had a national dialogue 

or study of the area. Economists have told us 
that the value of slave labor to the American 
economy and potential damages are greater 
that $7 trillion. Such a staggering sum indicates 
that the discussion of reparations must 
be about something other than money. 

However, I must stress that the reparations 
issue is not about a check to individuals. The 
call for reparations represents a commitment 
to entering a constructive dialogue on the role 
of slavery and racism in shaping American society. 
Everyone profited from the labor of the 
slaves, even later immigrants, because slave 
labor and the taxes from those enterprises 
built the infrastructure of this nation. The debt 
we talk about is not centuries old, but dates 
back only a few decades and is within our lifetimes 
because of Jim Crow. 

This nation must make a commitment to understanding 
how the legacy of slavery and its 
vestiges contribute to present day societal and 
economic inequality. That is why I re-introduce 

H.R. 40 at the opening of every Congress and 
sponsor a forum on reparations during every 
Congressional Black Caucus legislative conference. 
We must be diligent in our efforts to 
educate this nation about its history. I hope 
that in this 109th Congress, we can schedule 
formal hearings on this legislation to begin the 
process of having our nation finally acknowledge 
its debt.

DENTON RANKS 1ST AMONG MOST-
TECHNOLOGY-ADVANCED CITIES 

HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, it is my great 
honor to recognize Denton, Texas for being 
acknowledged as the No. 1 most technology-
advanced city with a population of 75,000 to 
124,999, by the Center for Digital Government. 
The ranking was based on the 2004 
Digital Cities Survey that examines how city 
governments are using digital technology to 
become more efficient and communicate with 
residents. 

The survey and ranking determined by the 
Center asked more than 600 mayors, managers 
and chief information officers to participate 
asking 24 questions focusing on implementation, 
adoption of online service delivery, 
planning and governance, and the network 
that allows cities to make the move to digital 
government. 

A life-long resident of Denton County, I offer 
my congratulations to the city of Denton and 
to Mayor Euline Brock.

COMPANY THAT DOES IT RIGHT 

HON. BERNARD SANDERS 

OF VERMONT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. Speaker, I want to bring 
to your attention a remarkable company, located 
in my home state of Vermont, that can 
and should serve as a model for corporate responsibility 
in this era so unfortunately marked 
by greed of CEO’s, who last year paid themselves 
301 times as much as the average 
worker in their companies. 


E6 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 2005 

The company I speak of is Chroma Technology 
Corporation of Rockingham, Vermont. 
It is completely employee owned. The firm has 
a flat pay scale, where no employee makes 
less than $37,500 and no one more than 
$75,000. Thus no top-level specialist makes 
more than twice what anyone on the shop 
floor earns. 

Yet Chroma competes in the global marketplace, 
taking the risks that other corporations 
do. It is a global, high-tech manufacturer of 
optical filters for microscopes used by the 
world’s top biologists. It is the major supplier 
to three of the four major microscope manufacturers 
in the world (Zeiss and Leica from 
Germany and Nikon from Japan). Chroma is 
also the second source for Olympus of Japan 
and was recently chosen as primary supplier 
to Motic, an emerging Chinese microscope 
company. Chroma is today a premier manufacturer 
of high-tech products, and expects 
sales of $16 million in 2004. 

While other companies practice outsourcing, 
Chroma remains locally rooted, with virtually 
all 68 employees living within a 50–mile radius 
of its facility in Rockingham. 

So amazing is its story—and so important is 
its lesson to how American companies can not 
only survive but thrive in the international marketplace—
that I want to tell that story to the 
American nation. 

When it began, Chroma had a policy of paying 
everyone the same wage, a wage pegged 
to the local living wage. By the time the firm 
grew to 17 employees in the early 1990s, everyone 
was making an identical $30,000 per 
year. ‘‘If we would have changed our wage 
structure at that point, we would have had a 
revolution,’’ says Chroma’s CEO, Paul Mill-
man. 

In 1996, Chroma instituted the policy that 
tenure would determine pay. ‘‘The criterion is 
longevity, rather than job description,’’ Mr. Mill-
man explains. Today the maximum salary of 
$75,000 is the same for everyone, though new 
employees can start higher than the minimum 
of $37,500. 

The disadvantage of this flat pay structure, 
according to Mr. Millman, is that some people 
with graduate degrees or business experience 
won’t work there, because they’ll be paid the 
same as someone in production. The advantage, 
he counters, is the cooperative atmosphere, 
the self-direction, and the lack of a 
managerial class. 

Chroma practices not just worker ownership, 
but worker democracy. At one time the company 
made decisions through a Quaker meeting 
format where consensus ruled, though 
that’s being revisited now that there are more 
employees. Still, there are no designated managers 
at Chroma, and employees occupy all 
seats on the board of directors. More than 95 
percent of company decisions are made on 
the shop floor. ‘‘We call it full exposure management,’’ 
says Gabe Capy, a member of 
Chroma’s shipping department who has been 
with the company eight years. ‘‘It is peer pressure 
that then encourages people to perform.’’ 

Nor does Chroma cut corners on environmental 
issues to cut costs. Chroma recently 
invested $130,000 to make its new 28,000-
square-foot factory energy-efficient. The company 
will recover those costs in less than two 
years through savings in electricity and propane 
costs. ‘‘They have gone far beyond the 

efficiency measures associated with standard 
building practices,’’ says Gabe Arnold, technical 
coordinator for Efficiency Vermont, a 
statewide energy efficiency utility. While most 
companies focus on lowering costs, he says, 
Chroma showed an innovative willingness to 
invest heavily up-front in efficiency. 

Because employee-owners intend to pass 
this company on to future generations, it is virtually 
impossible for Chroma to be sold. After 
the founders leave, no single employee will 
own more than 5 percent; a super-majority is 
needed to sell the company. 

Employee ownership, worker democracy, 
environmental stewardship—and an all-American 
work force: instead of being liabilities, 
these practices help Chroma compete in its 
global, high-tech markets. The structures of 
employee ownership and involvement contribute 
significantly to the high quality products 
that are Chroma’s trademark. ‘‘Other companies 
can build these filters quicker and cheaper,’’ 
Mr. Millman concedes, but because 
Chroma has educated the biologists who actually 
use the microscopes about its optics, it 
has developed strong customer loyalty. ‘‘That 
adds to the romance of our product,’’ he says. 
‘‘We now have three Ph.D. biologists on our 
staff, and that is no happy accident. No other 
optical filter company can say that.’’ 

While competing internationally, Chroma defines 
itself by a different economics than that 
touted by most business schools. ‘‘I prefer the 
term ‘sustainable economy,’ or an economy 
that keeps us living. That’s what Chroma is all 
about,’’ says Mr. Millman, CEO of what has 
been the fastest growing technology company 
in Vermont for the past five years. He credits 
the business environment in Vermont for nurturing 
Chroma’s value structure. ‘‘Vermont is 
the prototypical state for the creative economy,’’ 
he said. ‘‘This was the first state to 
abolish slavery. Outcasts from the ’60s and 
’70s came here and created communes. This 
is where Ben & Jerry’s started.’’ 

Vermont, I should mention with pride, along 
with Ohio, boasts the greatest concentration of 
employee-owned companies. 

At Chroma Technology, where committed 
employees lead naturally to loyal customers, 
being local goes hand-in-hand with being global. 
Chroma Technology shows us all that it’s 
possible to make a mark in the global economy 
and do it in a way that is sustainable and 
humane.

INTRODUCTION OF THE SOCIAL 

SECURITY PRESERVATION ACT 

HON. RON PAUL 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to protect the 
integrity of the Social Security trust fund by introducing 
the Social Security Preservation Act. 
The Social Security Preservation Act is a rather 
simple bill which states that all monies 
raised by the Social Security trust fund will be 
spent in payments to beneficiaries, with excess 
receipts invested in interest-bearing certificates 
of deposit. This will help keep Social 
Security trust fund monies from being diverted 

to other programs, as well as allow the fund 
to grow by providing for investment in interest-
bearing instruments. 

The Social Security Preservation Act ensures 
that the government will keep its promises 
to America’s seniors that taxes collected 
for Social Security will be used for Social Security. 
When the government taxes Americans 
to fund Social Security, it promises the American 
people that the money will be there for 
them when they retire. Congress has a moral 
obligation to keep that promise. 

With federal deficits reaching historic levels 
the pressure from special interests for massive 
new raids on the trust fund is greater than 
ever. Thus it is vital that Congress act now to 
protect the trust fund from big spending, pork-
barrel politics. Social Security reform will be 
one of the major issues discussed in this Congress 
and many of my colleagues have different 
ideas regarding how to best preserve 
the long-term solvency of the program. However, 
as a medical doctor, I know the first step 
in treatment is to stop the bleeding, and the 
Social Security Preservation Act stops the 
bleeding of the Social Security trust fund. I 
therefore call upon all my colleagues, regardless 
of which proposal for long-term Social Security 
reform they support, to stand up for 
America’s seniors by cosponsoring the Social 
Security Preservation Act.

ORGANIC FARMING IS ALIVE AND 

THRIVING IN VERMONT 

HON. BERNARD SANDERS 

OF VERMONT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. Speaker, I want to bring 
to the attention of this body, and the Nation, 
the wonderful work that has been done by the 
Northeast Organic Farming Association 
(NOFA), and in particular the wonderful work 
its affiliate does in Vermont. 

In a time when the family farm is under 
great destructive pressures, in a time when 
agribusiness blindly ignores the potential for 
damage that accompanies chemical pesticides 
and GMOs, in a time when corporate agriculture 
ignores the need to sustain and replenish 
the soil that sustains life, there are those 
who fight to maintain a good, healthy, ongoing 
source of food for all of us. 

NOFA Vermont has been fighting, and continues 
to fight, for family farms, for responsible 
husbandry of the soil, for a secure and healthful 
food supply. 

NOFA Vermont has been in existence for 
over 30 years, and is one of the oldest organic 
farming associations in the entire United 
States. The Vermont chapter, one of seven 
state chapters in the northeastern region of 
the United States, currently has over 1,000 
members. It has been a sustaining force for 
the 333 certified organic growers and producers 
in our New England state. They sell 
their produce and products in 52 farmers markets 
in Vermont, to local groceries and food 
stores, to grocery chains operating in 
Vermont, and indeed to distributors nationwide. 
In an especially noteworthy development, 
they have forged new relations with 
local buyers, and new distribution networks, 
through the formation of 42 Community Supported 
Agriculture (CSA) farms which provide 
food directly to consumers on an ongoing and 
regular basis. 

NOFA Vermont’s dual commitment is to 
local agriculture and to organic agriculture. It 
strives to be a steward of the soil, a preserver 
of the ongoing vitality of the environment, a 
proponent for healthy and nutritious foods. 
Through education, organic certification and 
technical assistance it strengthens the agricultural 
community in Vermont. Through its efforts 
to sustain community food security, and 
to promote both the marketing of organic products 
and the development of new markets, like 
the farmers markets and CSAs I mentioned a 
few minutes ago, it builds a stronger presence 
for healthful foods in Vermont. 

It is important that we take time to recognize 
the individuals and organizations which not 
only nourish—in every way—our present, but 
look forward with vision to creating a strong 
and sustainable world for our grandchildren 
and great-grandchildren. NOFA Vermont, and 
its hundreds of members, nourish us and 
show us the shape of a vital, vibrant and 
human-centered future. 

HONORING PACIFIC NORTHWEST 
NATIONAL LABORATORY 

HON. DOC HASTINGS 

OF WASHINGTON 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, 
on January 4, 1965, Battelle was selected 
by the federal government to manage and operate 
what was then called the Hanford Laboratories, 
and is now called the Pacific Northwest 
National Laboratory. I congratulate PNNL 
as it celebrates its 40th anniversary. PNNL is 
a unique asset to my congressional district, to 
Washington State, to the Pacific Northwest 
and to the entire nation. 

In 1965, Battelle committed to create a robust 
research operation in the State of Washington. 
It has absolutely delivered on its commitment. 
In the last 40 years, the number of 
staff at the lab has tripled, and business has 
increased from $20 million in 1965 to more 
than $600 million in 2004. As a leader in innovation, 
PNNL is an enduring asset in the Tri-
Cities with many spinoff companies and technologies. 
As such, the laboratory continues to 
build collaborations with the region’s colleges 
and universities and other scientific enterprises. 


With major contributions to national science 
and technology programs, especially in recent 
years on homeland and national security, the 
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is a valuable 
national asset and a vital part of regional 
efforts to create better jobs and 
strengthen our economy. 

Since 1965, Battelle has contributed more 
than $13 million to not-for-profit organizations 
in the region. Battelle has also invested more 
than $125 million in facilities and equipment at 
its campus in Richland. And as testimony to 
its excellent stewardship of the lab, PNNL 
continues to receive ‘‘Outstanding’’ ratings for 
management of the lab by the Department of 
Energy. It recently received its seventh consecutive 
Outstanding rating. 

As we look back on this exceptional record, 
we can also look forward with anticipation to 
Battelle’s continued leadership at PNNL. With 
the world class staff and resources at the lab, 
and Battelle’s excellent management, there is 
no limit to what can be done. 

Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by sharing 
the strong feelings that all of us have in the 
Tri-Cities and the State of Washington— 
Battelle is a great employer, a great corporate 
citizen, and we look forward to many more 
years of its presence and commitment to a 
better Washington, a prosperous Pacific 
Northwest, and a safer world.

JUSTICE AND EQUITY FOR MEM


BERS OF THE UNITED STATES 

MERCHANT MARINE 

HON. BOB FILNER 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker and colleagues, I 
rise today to correct an injustice that has been 
inflicted upon a group of World War II veterans, 
the World War II United States Merchant 
Mariners. 

World War II Merchant Mariners suffered 
the highest casualty rate of any of the 
branches of service while they delivered 
troops, tanks, food, airplanes, fuel and other 
needed supplies to every theater of the war. 

Compared to the large number of men and 
women serving in World War II, the numbers 
of the Merchant Mariners were small, but their 
chance of dying during service was extremely 
high. Enemy forces sank over 800 ships between 
1941 and 1944 alone. 

Unfortunately, this group of brave men were 
denied their rights under the G.I. Bill of Rights 
that Congress enacted in 1945. All those who 
served in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air 
Force or Coast Guard were recipients of benefits 
under the G.I. Bill. The United States Merchant 
Marine was not included. 

The Merchant Marine became the forgotten 
service. For four decades, no effort was made 
to recognize the contribution made by this 
branch of the Armed Services. The fact that 
Merchant Seamen had borne arms during 
wartime in the defense of their country 
seemed not to matter. 

No legislation to benefit merchant seamen 
was passed by Congress until 1988 when the 
Seaman Acts of 1988 finally granted them the 
a ‘‘watered down’’ G.I. Bill of Rights. Some 
portions of the G.I. Bill have never been made 
available to veterans of the Merchant Marine. 

In addition, they still have not received proper 
recognition as veterans for Social Security 
purposes. If they had the ‘‘veteran’’ designation, 
their Social Security would be calculated 
as if they had earned $160 more a month than 
they did earn during their time in service in the 
Merchant Marines. Of course, what this means 
is a smaller Social Security check, now that 
they are retired. 

While it is impossible to make up for over 
40 years of unpaid benefits, I propose a bill 
that will acknowledge the service of the veterans 
of the Merchant Marine and offer compensation 
for years and years of lost benefits. 

H.R. 23, the ‘‘Belated Thank You to the Merchant 
Mariners of World War II Act of 2004’’, 
will pay each eligible veteran a monthly benefit 
of $1000, and that payment would also go to 
their surviving spouses. It will also give them 
the Social Security that they are due by providing 
them with the status of ‘‘veteran’’ under 
the Social Security Act. 

E8 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 2005 

The average age of Merchant Marine veterans 
is now 81. Many have outlived their savings. 
An increase in their Social Security and 
a monthly benefit to compensate for the loss 
of nearly a lifetime of ineligibility for the GI Bill 
would be of comfort and would provide some 
measure of security for veterans of the Merchant 
Marine. 

I owe a debt of gratitude to Ian Allison of 
Santa Rosa, California and Henry Van Gemert 
of Palmetto, Florida who are Co-Chairs of the 
Just Compensation Committee of the U.S. 
Merchant Marine Combat Veterans, and to 
Ted Metula of Lemon Grove, California for 
bringing this issue to my attention. 

I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting 
and cosponsoring this legislation. We 
can fix the injustices endured by our Nation’s 
Merchant Marines by passing H.R. 23 as 
quickly as possible!

HONORING RAY STRONG ON HIS 
100TH BIRTHDAY 

HON. LOIS CAPPS 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to 
pay tribute to the artistic contributions of Ray 
Strong, on the occasion of his 100th Birthday. 

Ray Strong has contributed to the Santa 
Barbara community not only through his art, 
but also through his passion and commitment 
to education and his dedication to the preservation 
of our environment. His generosity has 
touched many, including those young artists 
fortunate enough to paint with Ray as part of 
the Oak Group. Ray Strong has assisted in 
raising money for a number of environmental 
causes and has brought awareness to many 
conservation issues through his work. 

In addition to exhibiting throughout the 
United States, Ray Strong’s work is held in the 
permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution. 
I am fortunate to have had some of 
Ray’s pieces grace the walls of all three of my 
Congressional district offices. Locally, Ray has 
been honored by Santa Barbara Beautiful and 
is revered by many in this community for his 
generosity, spectacular talent and his passion 
for our physical environment. 

Ray Strong’s enthusiastic dedication to recording 
the landscape around us reminds me 
just how precious our natural surroundings 
are. His commitment to environmental causes 
and his contributions to the American realist 
tradition are commendable. Ray Strong is a 
talented artist, generous teacher and role 
model to many. I am privileged to know Ray 
and I continue to be awed by his many talents.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO JOHN D.W. 
REILEY 

HON. TIM HOLDEN 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. HOLDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor John D.W. Reiley and to recognize the 
many contributions he has made to the city of 
Pottsville, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 

and the world. He knows no limits in his service 
and commitment to the people and communities 
he has touched over the years. 

John D.W. Reiley was born and raised in 
Pottsville, Pennsylvania, where he still resides 
today. He is a graduate of Pottsville Catholic 
High School and Saint Joseph’s University, 
Philadelphia. 

After serving with the United States Army in 
the U.S. and Germany, he was associated 
with Reiley’s Stores, Inc. in Pottsville. In May 
1976, he was named Secretary of the Pennsylvania 
Liquor Control Board, and he served 
in that capacity to the present time. 

As a lifelong resident of Pottsville, Mr. 
Reiley has been active in the Greater Potts-
ville Winter Carnival, serving as its first president. 
A member of the Pottsville Lions, he is 
a past President and past District Governor. 
He is currently Co-Chairman of Pottsville 
Cruise Night and is a Director of the Union 
Bank and Trust Company, UBT Realty, and 
the Schuylkill County Motor Club, the Pennsylvania 
League of Cities and Municipalities, and 
Penn Prime Insurance. 

In 1969, he was appointed to Pottsville City 
Council. He was re-elected later that year and 
again in 1973. 

He is also a member of Robert R. Wodbury 
Post #67 American Legion; Ancient Order of 
Hibernians, JFK Division (#2); Catholic War 
Veterans Post No. 1051; Knights of Columbus 
Council No. 431; Schuylkill Chapter of the National 
Football Foundation and College Hall of 
Fame; and the Yorkville Hose & Fire Company. 


Mr. Reiley is a past President of the Potts-
ville Merchants Association and past member 
of the Board of Directors of the Pennsylvania 
Retailers Association and the Pottsville Library. 


In March 2000, he was appointed Mayor of 
Pottsville, completing the term of his son Terence, 
who lost a five-year battle with leukemia 
while in office. In November 2001, John was 
re-elected to a full term. 

He is married to the former Agnes 
McGowan, and is the father of Hugh Reiley 

and the late Terry Reiley.

75TH ANNIVERSARY 
FRANCIS XAVIER 
CHURCH 
OF 
CATHST. 
OLIC 

HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 

OF INDIANA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great honor and enthusiasm that I congratulate 
St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church as 
they join together in the celebration of their 
75th anniversary. The festivities will begin on 
Saturday, January 8, 2005. The parish community 
of St. Francis will also host a variety of 
activities throughout the entire year of 2005. 

In 1882 there were two churches, Catholic 
and Methodist that existed in Lake Station, Indiana. 
The first Catholic Church was located 
at a Way Station on the Stage Line that operated 
between Michigan and Joliet. It stood on 
the identical spot which the present church 
now occupies. The Way Station was listed on 
railroad bulletins as Lake Station. The Michigan 
Central Railroad was built from Detroit to 
Chicago in 1852, and at this time the structure 

was not known as a parish church but as a 
chapel. This building was in existence before 
the railroad. The original bell from the structure 
was stored when the building was razed 
and is now still in use at the present church. 

Father Francis Xavier Guerre was the pastor 
of St. Mary of the Lake in Miller, Indiana. 
He was persuaded to start a mission parish in 
East Gary. Father Guerre founded the mission 
parish of St. Francis Xavier in 1930, and 
Bishop John F. Noll dedicated the church in 
1931. The name St. Francis Xavier was in 
honor of Father Guerre’s patron saint. The 
parish continued as a mission until 1941, 
when Bishop appointed Father Francis Quinn 
as its resident pastor. 

In 1950 Father Koors planned for the enlargement 
of the existing church and the erection 
of a Parochial School. However, Father 
Koors needed a written guarantee that nuns 
would be available to teach in the school. Six 
orders of nuns were contacted before a written 
guarantee was received from Mother Emily of 
the Poor Sisters of St. Francis of Seraph. 
Mother Emily persuaded her Council to give 
the necessary written guarantee for the Sisters 
to teach at St. Francis Xavier. On September 
5, 1956, the St. Francis Xavier School was officially 
opened for classes. The School was 
dedicated and blessed on November 11, 1956 
by Bishop Pursley. 

In 1984, Father Robert Evers became the 
Pastor of the St. Francis. Father Evers reopened 
the ‘‘Center’’ and procured the help of 
the Jesuits to service the Spanish community 
with week-end and daily masses. When the 
Jesuits left, liturgies were again celebrated in 
the main church. Father Evers retired in June 
2004 after serving the parish for 20 years. The 
proud parishioners are thankful for the spiritual 
and emotional leadership he and the previous 
pastors have provided during the years. 

The present church’s beautiful interior features 
sculptured statues of the Virgin Mary, St. 
Joseph, the Infant of Prague, and St. Theresa. 
The beautiful, dimly-lit interior is illuminated by 
sunlight through the stained-glass window and 
dozens of votive candles flicker through ruby 
and sapphire tinted globes. The present pastor, 
Reverend J. Anthony Valtierra and his 
congregation continue to serve the needs of 
the citizens of Northwest Indiana. By offering 
service and guidance to others, the members 
of St. Francis Xavier Church have proven their 
sincere dedication and motivation for assisting 
others in need. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other 
distinguished colleagues join me in honoring 
and congratulating St. Francis Xavier Church 
on their 75th anniversary. They have provided 
support and guidance for all those in the community. 
Their constant dedication and commitment 
is worthy of the highest commendation.

HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVER


SARY OF WASHINGTON HOS


PITAL’S SERVICE LEAGUE 

HON. FORTNEY PETE STARK 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. STARK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute 
to the 50th anniversary of Washington 
Hospital’s Service League. Washington Hospital, 
located in Fremont, CA, will mark the anniversary 
at a celebration on February 7, 
2005. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E9 

At 11:30 a.m., on March 6, 1955, ground 
was broken for the construction of Washington 
Hospital. During this same month, 14 civic-
minded women in the community came together 
to plan a volunteer organization that 
would work in and for the hospital. 

As a result of their commitment, the Washington 
Hospital Service League became a reality 
in 1956; the hospital opened on November 
24, 1958. The Service League’s goal 
was—and still is—to support the hospital by 
purchasing much needed equipment and to 
assist patients, visitors and staff. 

Over the years, the Service League has 
raised more than $1.79 million for equipment 
in almost every department at Washington 
Hospital, enabling community members to obtain 
state-of-the-art health care in their own 
community. Seed money donated by the Service 
League helped bring to fruition Washington 
Hospital Healthcare Foundation, Washington-
Stanford Radiation Oncology Center and the 
Community Health Resource Library. 

One of the Service League’s activities that 
has continued to change the lives of so many 
in the community was the establishment of a 
scholarship program in 1961. Since the first 
nursing scholarship in the amount of $150 was 
awarded to a nursing student at Highland Hospital, 
the volunteers have given more than 
$150,000 to students seeking a career in 
health care. 

The Service League volunteers also bring a 
human touch—freely offering a cheerful smile, 
a friendly attitude and thousands of hours of 
service to the hospital’s patients, visitors and 
staff. 

I join in congratulating all the volunteers 
who have contributed to the success of the 
Washington Hospital Service League over the 
past 50 years, and the present-day volunteers 
who continue to make a positive difference by 
giving back to the community.

A SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO THE 
ROPPE CORPORATION ON THE 
OCCASION OF ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY 


HON. PAUL E. GILLMOR 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. GILLMOR. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege 
to pay tribute to a special company in 
Ohio’s Fifth Congressional District. This year, 
the Roppe Corporation of Fostoria, OH, will 
celebrate 50 years of dedicated service. 

Mr. Speaker, the Roppe Corporation is one 
of the nation’s leading suppliers of rubber and 
vinyl flooring products and accessories. The 
Roppe Rubber Corporation was founded in 
1955, by Thony Roppe and production began 
in 1956. With only seven employees, the 
Roppe Rubber Corporation focused exclusively 
on rubber products. 

Through the expansion of its trucking fleet 
and an increased customer base, Roppe has 
grown and flourished since its beginning. Due 
to the expansion of products and services that 
Roppe Rubber offered, it officially changed its 
name, in 1990, to the Roppe Corporation. 

In 1993, the Miller family purchased the 
Roppe Corporation where Donald Miller continues 
to serve as chairman of the board, 
nearly 47 years after beginning his service at 

Roppe. With expanded facilities and dedicated 
leadership, the Roppe Corporation has become 
a premier employer in the Fifth Congressional 
District of Ohio. By maintaining its 
factory in Fostoria, OH, Roppe has become a 
permanent fixture in the community. 

Today, Roppe has become the world’s largest 
rubber wall base manufacturer. Roppe has 
over 45 distributors with 105 locations in the 
United States and exports products worldwide. 
The Roppe Corporation has grown in annual 
sales to $60,000,000 and now owns ATECO, 
Tri County Broadcasting, Seneca Millwork, 
Custom Corner, The Fostoria Focus, and 
Flexco. 

Mr. Speaker, the real success of the Roppe 
Corporation comes not only from its products, 
but from its people. The employees of the 
Roppe Corporation provide customers with the 
service and dependability that are expected of 
a first-class company. Beyond the walls of 
Roppe, its employees are model citizens by 
providing for and leading their community. In 
all but 1 of the past 20 years, Roppe employees 
were the highest per capita givers to the 
Fostoria United Way campaign. Each year, we 
can count on the employees of Roppe to give 
of their time and their means to the community 
of Fostoria, OH. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in paying special tribute to the employees and 
the legacy of the Roppe Corporation. As all 
who benefit from this fine company gather to 
celebrate its 50th anniversary of service, I am 
confident that the good people of Fostoria, 
OH, will continue the successes of the Roppe 
Corporation into the future.

HONORING DR. JIM KING OF WVXU 

IN CINCINNATI UPON HIS RE


TIREMENT 

HON. ROB PORTMAN 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Dr. Jim King, who is Director of Broadcasting 
and General Manager of WVXU, Xavier 
University’s public radio station in Cincinnati. 
He retired December 31, 2004 after 28 
years of dedicated service to our community, 
and will return to a full time Xavier faculty position. 


A native of Cheboygan, MI, Jim had an 
early interest in music. He began his interest 
in broadcasting while still a youngster with his 
own ‘‘pirate’’ radio station, and even then, he 
knew he wanted a career in radio. Later, he 
gained his first full time job in radio as a high 
school sophomore. At Western Michigan University, 
Jim earned a B.A. in English Literature 
and an M.A. in English Literature and Ancient 
History. Happily, he also met his wife of 37 
years, Kathy, there. In 1969, Jim and Kathy 
moved to Ann Arbor and in 1973, Dr. King 
earned a Ph.D in Radio, TV and Film from the 
University of Michigan. 

In 1976, Jim joined Xavier University as its 
full time professional manager of WVXU, 
which was then a small 10 watt FM station. 
Jim also serves as Professor of Communication 
Arts at Xavier. 

Over the years, WVXU has increased its 
power several times, and today, the station is 
26,000 watts. Under Jim’s visionary leader


ship, the station became a member of a regional 
network of seven stations in Ohio, Indiana, 
and Michigan. WVXU is now housed in a 
12,000 square foot broadcasting complex on 
the Xavier University campus, employs 25 
radio professionals, and has won almost every 
honor in broadcasting, including the George 
Foster Peabody Award, the industry’s most 
prestigious award. 

Simply put, Jim has improved the quality of 
life for all of us in the community by treating 
us to WVXU’s mix of vintage radio shows; 
award-winning news programs; financial information; 
and a beloved variety of music. 

All of us congratulate Jim on his retirement 
and wish him luck in the new challenges to 
come.

Mr. Hills, a social studies teacher at Lake 
Braddock Secondary School, was named Virginia’s 
2005 Teacher of the Year and will represent

came to Lake Braddock Secondary School 
where he still serves. 

He is a member of numerous education associations 
including the National Council of 
Social Studies, the Virginia Council of Social 
Studies, and is active in various Parent Teacher 
Associations. Mr. Hills has received the 
Washington Post Agnes Meyer Outstanding 
Teacher Award, as well as outstanding teacher 
awards from the University of Chicago and 
Smith College. 

Colleagues describe Mr. Hills as ‘‘the embodiment 
of a dedicated teacher who is energized 
by his students and at the same time 
energizes those in his classroom.’’ Former students 
praise Mr. Hills for making history come 
alive by telling stories and inspiring them to 
become teachers or earn graduate degrees in 
history. He is known for his use of the Socratic 
Method, spurring students to ‘‘think deeply and 
differently.’’ 

Our students are our number one resource. 
Mr. Hills has dedicated his life to ensuring that 
they are given the opportunity to achieve success. 
Over the past 44 years, he has made a 
lasting impact on thousands of students. 

I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding 
Joseph Hills and congratulating him on this 
distinguished achievement.

INTRODUCING THE SOUTHERN 

CALIFORNIA GROUNDWATER RE


MEDIATION ACT 

HON. JOE BACA 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, today, I will be reintroducing 
the Southern California Groundwater 
Remediation Act. This legislation is a 
long-term solution to help cities in Southern 
California remove perchlorate from their drinking 
water. 

Formerly H.R. 4606, this legislation passed 
the House of Representatives in September of 
2004. Today, I pick up the fight to clean up 
perchlorate groundwater contamination and 
protect the health of Southern Californians. 
Perchlorate groundwater contamination remains 
a crisis in Southern California. This includes 
my hometown of Rialto, California. 

Perchlorate is a main ingredient in rocket 
fuel. It has been found in drinking water supplies 
in 40 states, including California. It has 
been linked to thyroid damage, and may be 
especially harmful to infants and developing 
fetuses, and the 1.2 million women of childbearing 
age in San Bernardino, Riverside and 
Orange Counties. It could also be harmful to 
those with weak immune systems, such as 
seniors and AIDS patients. 

There is a legal and moral obligation to provide 
safe and healthy water. Today, these obligations 
are in jeopardy. The hardworking 
families in these areas are not at fault and 
should not have to pay for this problem. We 
must protect these consumers. 

Southern California, and particularly the Inland 
Empire, has been greatly impacted by 
perchlorate. Perchlorate has been detected in 
184 sources in the counties served by the 
Santa Ana River watershed. There is a perchlorate 
plume in the Inland Empire in California 
that is seven miles long and growing 
every day. It has affected 82 wells in San 
Bernardino County, and jeopardized the water 
supplies of 500,000 residents who rely on the 
Colorado River. 

The economic burden on these communities 
is almost as much of a concern as the potential 
health effects. The bill authorizes $50 million 
in much-needed assistance. It is modeled 
after a successful program in the San Gabriel 
Basin in Southern California that has also suffered 
from perchlorate-polluted water. And it is 
similar to H.R. 4459, a bill introduced by Richard 
Pombo in the 108th Congress that deals 
with perchlorate in Northern California, and 
passed the House last September. 

I urge my colleagues to support this urgent 
bill for Southern California, so we can tell 
these communities that help is on the way. I 
would like to thank Congresswoman GRACE 
NAPOLITANO, Congressman KEN CALVERT and 
Congressman GARY MILLER for their support of 
this crucial bill to the health of Southern Californians.

TRIBAL PARITY ACT 

HON. STEPHANIE HERSETH 

OF SOUTH DAKOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Ms. HERSETH. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to introduce the Tribal Parity Act today. This 
bill would fully compensate the Lower Brule 
Sioux Tribe and the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe 
in South Dakota for the lands that they lost in 
the last century as a result of the federal government’s 
construction of the massive dams 
on the main stem of the Missouri River. 

The 1944 Flood Control Act cost these 
tribes much in terms of lost land. It also took 
an enormous toll on the people of both tribes 
and their economies. It is critically important 
that we seek to fully reimburse these tribes for 
the lands they lost. 

The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe and the Crow 
Creek Sioux Tribe are both constituent bands 
of the Great Sioux Nation. Both border on the 
Missouri River in central South Dakota and 
are connected by the Big Bend Dam. 

Congress created a trust fund for the Crow 
Creek Sioux Tribe in 1996, and a separate 
trust fund for the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe in 
1997. These trust funds sought to compensate 

the tribes for the value of their land that is now 
permanently inundated as a result of the construction 
of the Big Bend Dam. Unfortunately, 
the formula that the General Accounting Office 
used to calculate amount of compensation for 
both tribes was substantially different than the 
formulas that it has used to calculate damages 
for many other similarly situated tribes. The result 
was unfair and inadequate compensation 
trust funds for these tribes. 

Parity for these tribes would mean an ability 
to actively work for the betterment of their 
communities. It would mean adequate roads 
and improved community facilities. It would 
mean better health care and newer schools. It 
would mean attracting commercial business 
and improving the local economy. Most importantly, 
it would mean a real chance for these 
tribes to provide future generations with the 
tools that so many of us take for granted. 

I would ask all of my distinguished colleagues 
to support the Tribal Parity Act and 
work with me to enact legislation that would 
fairly and appropriately compensate members 
of the Lower Brule and Crow Creek Sioux 
Tribes. I ask you to do it because of the tremendous 
positive difference it would make in 
the lives of those affected—and because it is 
the right and fair thing to do.

THE WORKER REEMPLOYMENT 
ACCOUNTS ACT OF 2005 

HON. JON C. PORTER 

OF NEVADA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to 
sponsor the Worker Reemployment Accounts 
Act of 2005. This important legislation will help 
thousands of unemployed Americans seeking 
to return to work by providing them with a Personal 
Reemployment Account. 

The American economy is the fastest growing 
economy of any industrialized nation in the 
world. Nationwide, more than 2.4 million jobs 
have been added since August 2003. The national 
unemployment rate has declined to 5.4 
percent, lower than the average rate during 
the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. In my own state 
of Nevada, unemployment has fallen to 3.7 
percent. Clearly, the Republican tax relief and 
growth package has helped to drive the strong 
recovery in our economy. But we still have 
more work to do. 

As the economy is adding thousands of new 
jobs and the unemployment rate is dropping 
across the country, the assistance provided by 
this bill is critical because we want to ensure 
that every job seeker has the resources they 
need to find a good job. That is what this bill 
is all about—helping Americans find careers. 

As President Bush proposed in his 2005 
budget, the Worker Reemployment Accounts 
Act permits the Secretary of Labor to use 
demonstration funding under the Workforce Investment 
Act to provide Personal Reemployment 
Accounts to those with the greatest challenges 
in returning to work quickly. 

Through competitive grants, the local One-
Stop Career Center system, where the unemployed 
already seek assistance in obtaining 
employment, will offer this important new benefit 
to unemployed workers, in addition to an 
array of employment services they already 
provide. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E11 

Under the bill, states and local workforce investment 
areas will be able to offer unemployed 
individuals who are most in need of 
help a reemployment account of up to $3,000. 
With these accounts, unemployed workers 
may purchase a variety of different services to 
help them find a good job, including job training, 
child care, transportation, housing assistance, 
short-term classes to upgrade skills, and 
employment counseling. 

One of the important features of the bill is 
that it provides individuals with significant new 
flexibility to design a package of services tailored 
to meet their needs. By taking into accounts 
the needs of the unemployed on an individual 
basis, our local, State, and federal 
governments will better equip these individuals 
with the tools they require to secure long-term, 
meaningful employment. 

In addition, recipients will be able to keep 
the balance of the account as a cash reemployment 
bonus if they become reemployed 
within 13 weeks and stay employed for six 
months. 

These new Personal Reemployment Accounts 
and the current job training services already 
administered under the Workforce Investment 
Act are both essential in helping displaced 
workers in areas of the country facing 
skill shortages and enhancing the workforce 
for our increasingly knowledge-based economy. 


The Secretary of Labor already has begun 
the process of testing the PRA concept 
through a very limited pilot program. However, 
the authority of this bill would allow the Secretary 
to test the concept in more areas, either 
within the seven states already participating or 
in additional states. The lessons learned 
through this demonstration program will help 
inform Congress regarding the best way to 
serve the unemployed and ultimately will result 
in better reemployment and training services 
for all workers. 

Over the past two years, Republicans have 
taken numerous steps to help unemployed 
workers. I am also proud to join 21’’ Century 
Competitiveness Subcommittee Chairman 
MCKEON and Chairman BOEHNER of the Education 
and the Workforce Committee in introducing 
the Job Training Improvement Act of 
2005. This bill will reauthorize and enhance 
the services provided through the Workforce 
Investment Act and the nation’s one-stop deliver 
system for workforce development. I am 
pleased that the provisions of the Worker Reemployment 
Accounts Act are included in this 
broader reauthorization package. 

I look forward to working with my colleagues 
to improve job training opportunities for all 
Americans and offer this new innovative option 
to help workers as quickly as possible. The 
choice and flexibility available through a Personal 
Reemployment Account is the additional 
assistance American families need to get back 
into high-wage, steady employment. By providing 
this enhanced assistance, we can ensure 
that Americans are able to meet the challenges 
of the ever-changing economy that 
they face. 

I was proud to see similar legislation pass in 
the House of Representatives in the 108th 
Congress, and am excited to see it become 
law in the 109th Congress. I urge my colleagues 
to support this critical legislation. 

THE REINTRODUCTION OF THE 

21ST CENTURY WATER COMMIS


SION ACT 

HON. JOHN LINDER 

OF GEORGIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. LINDER. Mr. Speaker, today I reintroduced 
my proposal, the ‘‘21st Century Water 
Commission Act.’’ This proposal, which was 
approved by the House on November 21, 
2003, but unfortunately not considered by the 
other body before the 108th Congress adjourned, 
will bring together our nation’s premier 
water experts to recommend strategies 
for meeting our water challenges in the 21st 
century. 

Some highlights of my 21st Century Water 
Commission legislation are as follows: 

The commission will look for ways to ensure 
fresh water for U.S. citizens for the next 50 
years; 

The commission will be composed of nine 
members appointed by the President, and key 
leaders in the House and Senate; 

The commission will look for ways to eliminate 
duplication and conflict among federal 
governmental agencies; 

The commission will consider all available 
technologies and other methods to optimize 
water supply reliability, availability, and quality, 
while safeguarding the environment; 

The commission will hold hearings in distinct 
geographical regions of the United States, and 
in Washington, D.C., to seek a diversity of 
views, comments, and input; and 

A final report will be due within three years 
of the commission’s inception. The report will 
include a detailed statement of the findings 
and conclusions of the commission, as well as 
recommendations for legislation and other 
policies. 

I want to be clear that this bill does not give 
the federal government more direct authority 
or control over water. Rather, this commission 
will make recommendations on how we can 
coordinate water management efforts on all 
levels so that localities, states, and the Federal 
government can work together to enact a 
comprehensive water policy to avoid future 
water shortages. 

As Benjamin Franklin noted in 1746, ‘‘When 
the well’s dry, we know the worth of water.’’ 
Nothing could be truer, and many states 
across the country that are currently facing a 
water crisis, or have in the last few years, understand 
the wisdom of these words. 

I look forward to working with my colleagues 
in the House in moving this bill forward 
promptly. The U.S. cannot afford to reevaluate 
its water policies every time a crisis hits. Now 
is the time to get ahead of this issue, and I 
believe that the 21st Century Water Commission 
can serve as a channel for sharing the 
successful strategies and ideas that will allow 
us to do so.

TRIBUTE TO JACK HALPERN 

´ 

HON. JOSE E. SERRANO 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to Mr. Jack Halpern, a highly ac


complished Jewish American who will be honored 
on January 27, 2005, at the Annual 
Northeast Regional Tribute of the American 
Israel Public Affairs Committee. 

Jack, a resident of Manhattan, lives with his 
wife Lieba and their two wonderful children. 
He is a managing member of Atlantic Realty, 
which develops residential and commercial 
real estate in New Jersey, New York and 
Israel. 

In addition to his duties with Atlantic Realty, 
Jack somehow finds the time to work as an 
activist. Following in the footsteps of his father 
Sam, who founded the family business after 
surviving the Holocaust, Jack has become an 
active supporter of numerous Jewish causes. 
As a member of AIPAC’s National Executive 
Committee, Jack has been a leader in 
strengthening ties between the U.S. and Israel 
for many years. 

In 2002, Jack founded the Energy Independence 
Task Force at the American Jewish 
Congress, where he currently serves on the 
Governing Council and Executive Committee. 
This important task force continues to work for 
fuel efficiency standards in trucks and SUVs. 
In addition they have met with many key Congressional 
and Administration officials in order 
to deliver the message that a long-term national 
energy policy focusing on reducing the 
United States’ dependency on Middle East oil 
is a national security imperative. 

Jack’s long-time associations also include 
State of Israel Bonds, the Jewish Community 
Center of Manhattan, the Holocaust Resource 
Foundation, the Technion Institute and the 
Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. 

Mr. Speaker, Jack Halpern is a model 
American citizen worthy of the award which 
will be bestowed upon him. His efforts have 
not only helped to strengthen the two countries 
he cares most deeply for (America and 
Israel) but have also helped to strengthen their 
special relationship. 

For his continued service on AIPAC’s Executive 
Committee and his work on improving 
U.S.-Israeli relations, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in paying tribute to Mr. Jack Halpern.

INTRODUCING THE NATIONAL OCE


ANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMIN


ISTRATION ACT 

HON. VERNON J. EHLERS 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, today I am 
pleased to introduce the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration Act. Better known 
as NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration was created by Executive 
Order in 1970. It is the nation’s lead civilian 
agency for oceans and atmosphere, yet 
Congress has never passed an overarching 
organic act describing the mission and functions 
of the agency. Instead, over the past 34 
years Congress has defined the mission of the 
agency in a piecemeal manner with legislation 
focused on specific issues. The bill I am introducing 
today, which passed the Environment, 
Technology and Standards Subcommittee in 
the 108th Congress, is a first step toward 
Congressional passage of comprehensive legislation 
for NOAA. 

Last year, the U.S. Commission on Ocean 
Policy released its long awaited report with 


E12 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 2005 

recommendations for a coordinated national 
ocean policy. One of its key recommendations 
is that Congress should pass an organic act 
for NOAA. In his response to the Ocean Commission 
report, President Bush supported this 
recommendation. The time is right for Congress 
to consider, and pass, this organic act 
for NOAA. 

My bill establishes the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) within the 
Department of Commerce. It defines the mission 
of NOAA as ‘‘to understand and predict 
changes in the Earth’s oceans and atmosphere 
and the effects of such changes on the 
land environment, to conserve and manage 
coastal, ocean, and Great Lakes ecosystems, 
and to educate the public about these topics.’’ 
The recent Indian Ocean tsunami is just the 
latest evidence of the need for NOAA’s research 
and services. My bill maintains the current 
leadership structure at NOAA, but adds a 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Science and 
Technology to serve as the point person for 
the agency to coordinate the research and 
science activities of NOAA across the agency. 

This bill also describes the functions of 
NOAA, which are divided into three broad 
groups to improve cooperation among NOAA’s 
programs, as recommended by the U.S. Commission 
on Ocean Policy. First is the National 
Weather Service, which provides weather, 
water and climate forecasts and warnings to 
the nation. The second group is operations 
and services, which includes all of NOAA’s 
satellites services and its mapping and charting 
services. The third category of functions is 
research and education. 

The bill focuses on pieces of NOAA under 
Science Committee jurisdiction, and does not 
currently include any references to NOAA’s 
fisheries or resource management, which are 
under the jurisdiction of the Resources Committee 
here in the House. I am hopeful that we 
can work with other committees in the House 
and our colleagues in the Senate to pass a 
truly comprehensive organic act for NOAA, but 
for now we must start with this legislation. 

I believe it is critical for NOAA’s mission to 
be clearly defined so it can better fulfill its role 
in observing, managing, and protecting our nation’s 
coastal, ocean and Great Lakes resources. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
in a bipartisan fashion to pass this bill 
into law this year. This will not be an easy 
task, but it is so important to our environment, 
our economy, and our children’s and grandchildren’s 
future, that we must succeed.

INTRODUCING THE CONYERS-

SHERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL 

AMENDMENT 

HON. BRAD SHERMAN 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to join my colleague, Congressman JOHN 
CONYERS, the ranking member of the Judiciary 
Committee, in introducing the Conyers-Sherman 
Presidential Eligibility Constitutional 
Amendment. This Amendment will allow any 
foreign-born person who has been a United 
States citizen for 20 years or longer to qualify 
to run for President of the United States. Once 
enacted and ratified, this amendment will allow 

millions of well qualified Americans to aspire 
to our nation’s highest office. 

This bill is not about the election prospects 
of any one man or woman. It is about the 
dreams of all Americans. Every year I visit 
high schools in the San Fernando Valley. I tell 
those students that America is a great country, 
a land of opportunity. I want to tell them that 
it is also a country where any child can grow 
up to be President of the United States. Unfortunately, 
for many high school students in my 
district, the fact that they were born in another 
country is a complete and unequivocal bar to 
the Presidency. 

All American children regardless of where 
they are born should have all the rights and 
responsibilities of native born Americans. All 
American children should be able to aspire to 
rise as far as their talent, energy and ability 
allow them, including our nation’s highest office. 
There is no good reason to exclude 
Americans who will grow up to attend our colleges 
and universities, who will protect America 
in our armed forces, or who will work hard 
and pay their taxes, from our nation’s highest 
office. When this Constitutional Amendment is 
passed and ratified each of them will have that 
opportunity. 

The exact reasons for including the natural 
born citizen language in the Constitution are 
lost to history. The meticulous record of the 
Constitutional Convention, kept by James 
Madison, hardly gives it a mention. Regardless 
of that lost reasoning, America is now a 
nation of immigrants. We are a nation that 
should encourage those who come here to aspire 
to their highest goals and loftiest dreams. 
Mr. Speaker, the Constitutional Amendment 
Mr. CONYERS and I introduce today will make 
some of those dreams a possible reality for 
the first time in our history.

RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF HILLIARD LYONS 

HON. ANNE M. NORTHUP 

OF KENTUCKY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mrs. NORTHUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Hilliard Lyons’ 150th anniversary. 
During 2004 this respected investment firm 
completed its 150th year of doing business in 
Louisville, Kentucky. 

The Hilliard Lyons story began in 1854 with 
the creation of the firm Quigley and Lyons. 
The Civil War split the partnership but Henry 

J. Lyons continued the business. The business 
grew and Lyons bought a seat on the 
New York Stock Exchange in 1878. During the 
same time period, John James Byron Hilliard 
entered the banking business under the name 
J.J.B. Hilliard & Son. 
As Louisville and Kentucky grew, so did Hilliard 
Lyons. When Kentucky sought to link 
itself to important markets, Hilliard Lyons 
helped finance the first bridge across the Ohio 
River at Louisville. Furthermore, as technology 
changed, Hilliard Lyons was on the cutting 
edge of business innovation. Moving from ticker 
tape to keypunch machines in its early 
days, the firm has been eager to embrace 
technology. In fact, Hilliard Lyons was the first 
brokerage firm outside New York to automate 
the processing of stock trades. 

In 1972, the firm replaced its partnership 
business model with a corporation. Further 

changes came in 1998 when PNC Financial 
Services Group purchased Hilliard Lyons. 

Hilliard Lyons is a proud resident of downtown 
Louisville. The firm’s headquarters are 
located in the former Stewart’s Dry Goods department 
store on Muhammad Ali Boulevard in 
downtown Louisville. Hilliard Lyons has occupied 
this location since 1986. 

Today, Hilliard Lyons is a full-service investment 
operating 80 branch offices in 13 states. 
Hilliard Lyons employs 1,300 people who 
serve 250,000 customers. 

Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Hilliard 
Lyons after 150 years of service to Kentucky 
and the Nation. The citizens of Louisville are 
proud of Hilliard Lyons and we congratulate 
them on this historic milestone.

HONORING FIRE CHIEF ROB 
DAHLMAN 

HON. THADDEUS G. McCOTTER 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. MCCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of a great public servant upon his retirement 
from his noble profession. 

Fire Chief Rob Dahlman served the citizens 
of Wayne Michigan since he began his career 
with the Wayne Fire Department in May 1976 
and continued his employment with the city for 
the next twenty-nine years. Rob was first promoted 
to Lieutenant in January 1990. Four 
years later, he was promoted to Deputy Fire 
Chief and Fire Marshal. Finally, he was promoted 
to Fire Chief in 1999. 

His education includes a degree in Fire 
Science Technology from Henry Ford Community 
College cumulating with a State of Michigan 
certified specialist license, the first City of 
Wayne Fire Chief to achieve this status. 

Fire Chief Dahlman’s past affiliations and titles 
are vast and varied. He is a Certified Fire 
Inspector with the Michigan State Fire Marshal 
Office, and active member of the International 
Association of Arson Investigators, Metropolitan 
Detroit Fire Inspectors and the Michigan 
Fire Inspectors Society. Rob has been the 
Emergency Program Manager of the City of 
Wayne and was instrumental in instituting and 
effective emergency operations plan. 

Under Fire Chief Dahlman’s administration, 
the Wayne Fire Department achieved its goal 
of building a state-of-the-art fire department. In 
2003, the force moved into a new facility 
which has set a high standard for neighboring 
fire departments to follow. He has also expanded 
the services the department provides 
by adding two new rescue units and helped 
secure funding to provide several other life 
saving pieces of equipment. 

Fire Chief Dahlman once said, ‘‘I am not a 
hero, but I am an individual who is constantly 
concerned about the well being of others.’’ 
Rob’s career has echoed this sentiment, which 
can be attested to by his long list of accomplishments 
and praise he has constantly received 
throughout his professional life as a 
firefighter. 

His wife Robin, sons Ryan and Randy, 
daughter-in-law Kelly, and grandson Brandon 
should be extremely proud of the undeniable 
mark he has left on the community. We at 
home will remember and always benefit from 
his dedication and leadership. 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E13 

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of us all, I extend 
my sincere appreciation to Fire Chief Rob 
Dahlman for his fine service to our community 
and our country.

IN HONOR OF DICK BARELLI 

HON. SAM FARR 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Dean Richard (Dick) Barelli, 
a dedicated public servant who passed away 
on October 1st, 2004. He was a valuable 
member of the Monterey Bay community and 
will be sorely missed by all who had the pleasure 
of knowing him. 

Dick Barelli was born in Hammond, Indiana 
on February 25, 1937 to Dean and Anne 
Barelli. After graduating from Notre Dame University, 
Dick served as a 1st Lieutenant in the 
United States Army at Monterey County’s own 
Fort Ord. Dick then earned his law degree 
from the University of California, Hastings College 
of Law, and in 1970 moved to Monterey 
to become one of the first Monterey County 
Assistant Public Defenders. He went into private 
practice, and was a founding member of 
the Monterey College of Law in 1972. Dick 
was appointed Superior Court Judge of Monterey 
County in 1977, where he served for five 
years. Although Dick retired in 1982 he has 
served as Deputy County Counsel for the past 
nine years, and was actively involved in the 
Monterey County Bar Association, where he 
served as President. 

Mr. Speaker, I applaud Dean Barelli’s many 
accomplishments, and I commend him for his 
lifelong dedication to his community and 
friends. I knew Dean Barelli during my time as 
a Monterey County supervisor, and was deeply 
saddened to hear of his passing. I join the 
Monterey Bay community, his friends and his 
family in honoring this truly admirable man for 
all of his lifelong achievements.

INTRODUCTION OF NATIONAL 
SECURITY LANGUAGE ACT 

HON. RUSH D. HOLT 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, we can no longer 
keep our nation safe if we do not commit ourselves 
to learning the languages and cultures 
of critical areas around the world. The security 
of our troops overseas and the American people 
here at home demand that we act quickly 
to eliminate the severe shortage of critical 
need language professionals in this country. 
While the last Congress has taken some 
steps, we have not done enough. 

That’s why I rise today to introduce legislation, 
the National Security Language Act, 
which would significantly expand our investment 
in foreign language education on the primary, 
secondary, and post-secondary level. 

Al Qaeda operates in over 75 countries, 
where hundreds of languages and dialects are 
spoken. However, 99 percent of American 
high school, college and university programs 
concentrate on a dozen (mostly European) 

languages. In fact, more college students currently 
study Ancient Greek (20,858) than Arabic 
(10,596), Korean (5,211), Persian (1,117), 
and Pashto (14) put together. We need to do 
more to make sure that America has the language 
professionals necessary to defend our 
national security. This cannot be done overnight. 
We are already years overdue. 

The 911 Congressional Joint Inquiry reports 
our intelligence community is at 30 percent 
readiness in languages critical to national security. 
Despite this alarming statistic, we do 
not appear to be taking the necessary aggressive 
action to address this problem. Various 
agencies are making efforts to hire more linguists. 
When I asked a panel of intelligence 
experts at a recent Intelligence hearing what 
the federal, government is doing to increase 
the pool of critical need language professionals 
from which they hire these linguists, 
they answered with silence. Two years after 
the events of September 11, we are still failing 
to address one the most fundamental security 
problems facing this nation. 

Changing our recruiting methods alone will 
not solve the problem. To meet new security 
needs, we need to create a new domestic 
pool of foreign language experts and we can 
only do that by investing in the classroom. 

The National Security Language Act would 
expand federal investment in education in foreign 
languages of critical need, such as Arabic, 
Persian, Korean, Pashto, and Chinese. 
Specifically, my bill would provide loan forgiveness 
of up to $10,000 for university students 
who major in a critical need foreign language 
and then take a job either in the federal workforce 
or as a language teacher. It would provide 
new grants to American universities to 
establish intensive in-country language study 
programs and to develop programs that encourage 
students to pursue advanced science 
and technology studies in a foreign language. 

My bill would also establish grants for foreign 
language partnerships between local 
school districts and foreign language departments 
at institutions of higher education. And 
it would authorize a national study to identify 
heritage communities here in the United 
States with native speakers of critical foreign 
languages and make them targets of a federal 
marketing campaign encouraging students to 
pursue degrees in those languages. 

Just as the National Defense Education Act 
of 1958 created a generation of scientists, engineers, 
and Russian linguists to confront the 
enemy of that time, the National Security Language 
Act will give us a generation of Americans 
able to confront the new threats we face 
today.

RECOGNIZING MR. JOE 
GOVERNALE 

HON. HILDA L. SOLIS 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay 
tribute to a great gentleman who has devoted 
a majority of his life to civil service—Joe 
Governale, who is retiring as Postmaster of 
Covina. 

Born in Chicago, Mr. Governale received a 
Masters Degree in Psychology from Cal State 
Fullerton. Married to wife Judy, and proud fa


ther of two children, Mr. Governale was first 
employed in the Postal Service in 1964. 

While on leave from the Postal Service, Mr. 
Governale was in the U.S. Navy as a Corpsman 
from 1966 to 1970. Mr. Governale served 
on the cruiser USS Canabera and then with 
the Marines during the Vietnam War. 

After returning from Vietnam to his clerk job 
at the Covina Post Office, Mr. Governale 
found a new post office had been built while 
he was gone and within it, he found a new 
home. Within two years, Mr. Governale moved 
into management and was appointed to the 
position of Director of Human Resources in 
1982. Mr. Governale was selected as the 
Postmaster of Baldwin Park in 1986, and is 
the longest serving Postmaster in the history 
of Covina. Mr. Governale also received his 
teaching credentials and has taught postal operations 
for many years to new supervisors. 

Mr. Governale is a fan of the Chicago Bears 
and the White Sox, and his hobbies include 
video poker and reading. Mr. Governale plans 
to retire in Laughlin, Nevada, so he can enjoy 
time with his family. 

Mr. Governale is a wonderful example of a 
person who dedicated his life to civil service. 
I am proud to recognize Mr. Joe Governale 
and his many years of work as a civil servant 
as he retires as Postmaster of Covina.

TRIBUTE TO THE LATE MRS. 
MABEL YAP 

HON. KENDRICK B. MEEK 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is with 
deep sorrow that I rise to pay this tribute to 
the late Mrs. Mabel Yap. She was one of 
Miami-Dade County’s matriarchs who contributed 
immense good to our community. 

Mrs. Yap’s passing on December 27, 2004 
leaves a deep void, especially for those of us 
who have known her quiet and dignified spirit 
in urging her children and grandchildren to advance 
the common good of our beloved community 
in an unselfish manner. The funeral 
Mass to celebrate her life is being held today, 
Tuesday, January 4, 2005, beginning at 2:00 

p.m. at St. Louis Catholic Church, and will be 
followed by her interment at Woodlawn Cemetery 
in South Miami. 
She was the loving and devoted wife of Mr. 
Patrick Yap and the mother of eight children, 
21 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren. 
Mrs. Yap symbolized the dutiful mother whose 
home offered sanctuary and solace to all 
those who sought her help. Her nurturing spirit 
and perseverance amidst overwhelming odds 
transformed her into a matron of love and caring 
for all those who came to her seeking her 
advice on a myriad of things. Buttressed by 
her unflinching faith and her willingness to pay 
the price, she went about doing good, especially 
on behalf of the less fortunate. 

Though a highly private individual, the late 
Mabel Yap consecrated her life to raising a 
family of achievers, and has been a resilient 
voice in articulating the need for responding to 
the plight of our community’s immigrants. In so 
doing she symbolized all that is good and 
noble about the American spirit of idealism 
and optimism, and she worked long and hard 
in hopes that our nation truly become a land 
of opportunity for all. 


E14 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 2005

to us. Indeed, I am privileged to 
have been touched by the magnificent contributions 
she has made to our community 
through her family. I now join our community 
in thanks for her grace and for her noble and 
giving presence during her time with us.

THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION EN


FORCEMENT AND SOCIAL SECU


RITY PROTECTION ACT OF 2005 

HON. DAVID DREIER 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, the past several 
months have seen an almost unprecedented 
focus in this body on the extremely important 
issue of homeland security. Just a few weeks 
ago, we passed the National Intelligence Reform 
Act, a landmark piece of legislation to 
overhaul our intelligence agencies. But, as I 
noted at that time, the bill unfortunately did not 
go far enough in addressing the major security 
vulnerability presented by the porous nature of 
our borders. 

So as we continue to address the issue of 
border security, I am proud to be an original 
co-sponsor of Chairman SENSENBRENNER’s 
legislation to complete the San Diego border 
fence, and ensure that illegal immigrants are 
unable to receive drivers’ licenses, something, 
I might add, already prohibited in my home 
state of California. 

But in addition to these important steps that 
will soon be taken, I rise to ask for the support 
of my colleagues for an illegal immigration 
control plan that I am pleased to introduce 
today. The plan is the brainchild of T.J. 
Bonner, the President of the National Border 
Patrol Council, and a 26-year veteran of the 
Border Patrol who still serves with them today. 

T.J. believes that our proposal will eliminate 
up to 98 percent of the illegal border crossings 
into the United States. 
T.J. and I share the belief that for any proposal 
to stop illegal immigration to be successful, 
it must get at the root cause of what 
attracts illegal immigrants to our country—and 
that is the lure of economic opportunity and 
the ease with which illegal workers can find 
jobs. Under the Bonner Plan, we will dramatically 
increase the enforcement of laws which 
prohibit American businesses from employing 
illegal immigrants. Regrettably, too many employers 
have been unwilling to comply with the 
law. The growing availability of counterfeit 
identity documents has also undermined the 
current system because employers are increasingly 
unable to establish the authenticity 
of documents presented by job applicants. 
Our legislation adds new features to the Social 
Security card to deter counterfeiting and 
make it easier for employers to determine 
whether a card is genuine by including a 
digitized photo of the cardholder on the card. 
The improved Social Security card will also be 
encoded with a unique electronic encryption 
code to allow employers to verify each prospective 
applicant’s work eligibility status prior 
to hiring, through either an electronic card-
reader or a toll-free telephone number. Employers 
will face stiff federal fines of $50,000 
and up to 5 years in prison if they hire an illegal 
immigrant or choose not to verify a pro


spective employee’s work eligibility. The employer 
would also be required to reimburse the 
government for the cost of deporting the illegal 
immigrant. 

With the improved Social Security card and 
national verification system, employers will 
have no excuse for hiring illegal immigrants. 
By eliminating the supply of jobs for illegal 
workers, we will end the incentive for illegal 
immigrants to enter the United States because 
they will know that they will be unable to make 
a living here. 

Legal workers will only need to update their 
Social Security card once, to have their photo 
placed on the card and for other long-overdue 
anti-fraud measures to be applied. A worker 
would only need the updated Social Security 
card when applying for a new job. I want to 
make it very, very clear that this proposal 
does not represent the creation of a national 
identification card. This bill strictly prohibits the 
use of the Social Security card as a national 
ID card, and stipulates that the card not be required 
to be routinely carried on one’s person. 
Social Security cards are often already required 
to be provided to new employers; the 
changes we are proposing to the Social Security 
card take us no further down the road of 
creating a national ID card. 

Finally, the Bonner Plan also puts teeth into 
the new enforcement procedures by calling for 
the addition of 10,000 new Homeland Security 
officers whose sole responsibility will be to enforce 
employer compliance with the law. 
These new agents will free up the rest of the 
Border Patrol to exclusively focus on border 
enforcement and terrorism prevention. 

Mr. Speaker, I do not stand here today to 
tell the rest of the world that we intend to limit 
opportunities for the American dream to be fulfilled. 
But if foreign nationals wish to come to 
the United States, they must, as Governor 
Schwarzenegger said, ‘‘play by the rules,’’ and 
we must make clear that there will be no economic 
opportunity for anyone who enters this 
country illegally. I look forward to continuing to 
work with my colleagues in this effort, and 
hope they will consider joining me as we take 
action on this vital national security priority.

ENSURING COLLEGE ACCESS FOR 
ALL AMERICANS ACT 

HON. RUSH D. HOLT 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, since 1973, the 
Pell Grant program has been the backbone of 
making higher education affordable in the 
United States, with more than five million students 
receiving nearly 13 billion dollars in aid 
this year alone. Unfortunately, President Bush 
recently made a change to student aid policy 
that will cut more than $300 million in federal 
scholarships to low- and moderate-income college 
students for the 2005–06 school year. As 
a result, 1.3 million students will have their 
Pell Grant scholarships either reduced or 
eliminated. 

Current law allows students and their families 
to deduct state and local taxes when calculating 
how much income they have available 
to pay for the cost of higher education. This 
recent Bush update changes the way families 
calculate these deductions, and as a result, 

1.3 million students will have their Pell scholarships 
reduced or eliminated. In essence, the 
change would make it appear that families 
have more money available to pay for tuition, 
decreasing the amount of Federal student aid, 
as well as other need-based aid for which 
families are eligible. 
This is why I am introducing legislation 
along with Representative TIM BISHOP to reverse 
the $300 million Pell scholarship cut. 
Specifically, our bill would prevent any student 
from having his or her federal Pell Grant eligibility 
amount reduced as a result of the recent 
changes to student aid. This would enable the 
Department of Education to fine tune the eligibility 
calculation without hurting students and 
families who rely on these scholarships to pay 
for college. 

Today, education is more important than 
ever to solving the most pressing problems of 
our communities and the country. We must do 
everything possible to help American students 
attend college.

RECOGNIZING THE ACTIVITIES OF 
MRS. RUTH WILLNER 

HON. HILDA L. SOLIS 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize 
an extremely active and dedicated 
woman, Mrs. Ruth Willner for her contributions 
to the Monterey Park Democratic Club. In addition 
to working and raising two children, Mrs. 
Willner has still found the time to be very involved 
in her community. 

Many groups in the Los Angeles area are 
fortunate to count Mrs. Willner as one of their 
members. However, the time that she has 
contributed to the Monterey Park Democratic 
Club is especially remarkable. Mrs. Willner 
has been a Monterey Park Democratic Club 
member for nearly 40 years. 

In addition to being a member she also assumed 
the role of the club’s Newsletter Editor 
and has held that position for the past 20 
years. For the past two decades, she has 
served as the newsletter’s only reporter, writer 
and editor. Her work played an integral role in 
keeping members up to date and in touch. 

In December, Mrs. Willner produced her last 
newsletter for the club and retired as the 
Newsletter Editor. Although she will relinquish 
her position, her hard work and devotion will 
not be forgotten. Her commitment and drive is 
an inspiration to us all.

Mr. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
pay tribute to a pair of heroes whose courage 
has served as an inspiration to many in South 
Florida during this past holiday season. 

Shortly after 8:00 p.m. on Tuesday, December 
22, 2004, an unattended candle sparked a 
flame that engulfed a home in the City of 
Miami Gardens, FL; fourteen-year-old Ramon

Butler who lives next door immediately responded 
to cries for help. Ramon entered the 
burning home without regard to his own personal 
safety, located and rescued a one-year-
old child and then reentered the home in an 
attempt to locate the baby’s five-month-old sister. 
Unfortunately, the roof began to collapse 
and he could not proceed any further and 
exited the home. 

At this point, City of Miami Gardens Police 
Officer Corey Jones arrived on the scene. 
Aware that the baby was still inside and told 
which room she was in, Officer Jones rushed 
back to the home, pulled hurricane shutters 
open, cranked the window open and leaped 
inside. Though the flames were intense and 
smoke filled the home, Officer Jones was successful 
in locating the infant and bringing her 
out to safety. 

The Miami-Dade County Police Department 
recently presented its highest civilian honor, 
the Silver Medal of Valor, to Ramon Butler, 
and both he and Officer Jones have been acknowledged 
by Miami Gardens Mayor Shirley 
Gibson for their acts of bravery. It is with great 
pride that I too pay tribute to the efforts of 
these two community heroes and extend my 
congratulations to each of them for a job well 
done.

THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PRO


GRAM ASSESSMENT AND RE


SULTS ACT 

HON. TODD RUSSELL PLATTS 

OF PENNSYLVANIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. PLATTS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce 
important legislation to improve the efficiency 
and effectiveness of our Federal government—
the Program Assessment and Results 
Act, or PAR Act, which establishes a 
statutory requirement that the Office of Management 
and Budget, OMB, working with 
agencies, review and assess the effectiveness 
of each federal program at least once every 
five years. As elected representatives of the 
people, we have a responsibility to use taxpayer 
dollars in the most effective way possible. 
As Congress formulates its budget each 
year, we must have the best information available 
to us on which to base our spending decisions. 


The Government Performance and Results 
Act, or GPRA, has laid a solid foundation for 
agencies working with Congress to set strategic 
goals and begin to utilize performance 
based information. Building on GPRA, we 
must take the next step toward reforming the 
way the government conducts business. 

One of the key aspects of any reform effort 
is to change the prevailing mindset. If our emphasis 
is on creating a more results-oriented 
government, then we must change our 
mindset from outputs to outcomes. It takes 
time to achieve this type of cultural shift. The 
reforms of the early 1990s—the CFO Act, 
GPRA and others—are just beginning to work 
as intended. 

Prior efforts to make the federal government 
more effective—the Hoover Commission, 
Zero-Based Budgeting, the Planning-Programming-
Budgeting System, Reinventing Govern-
ment—have come and gone with little lasting 
effect. Federal managers have learned that if 

they wait, each new administration is likely to 
attempt yet another broad based reform. From 
a management standpoint, it is difficult in that 
type of environment to make long-range plans; 
and it’s next to impossible to achieve the kind 
of cultural shift needed to reform the management 
of the federal government. 

By enacting GPRA, Congress put government 
reform in statute. Because of this statutory 
framework, federal managers now look at 
the requirements for performance plans and 
strategic plans required by GPRA and know 
they are here to stay regardless of changes in 
Congress and the Executive Branch. When 
the first agency strategic plans fell short of expectations, 
the reform effort was not 
scrapped—it was improved. Now, ten years 
after GPRA was enacted, we have strategic 
plans that are more in line with what was envisioned. 
We have seen slow, sustainable improvement. 


GPRA requires that agencies focus attention 
on program evaluation as one of six aspects 
of their strategic plans. Unfortunately, according 
to a 2004 report from the Government Accountability 
Office, program evaluation is the 
one area where departments consistently 
come up short. Not only have agencies failed 
to comply with this requirement, the valuable 
information that stands to be gained from 
these evaluations is not culled, coordinated, or 
presented in a useful way. 

We have seen great progress in meeting 
other objectives set out in GPRA. In 1997, 
only 76 percent of federal managers had developed 
performance measures. By 2003, that 
number had risen to 89 percent. It is now time 
to strengthen GPRA to address the shortfall 
we see in program evaluation. 

By creating and using the Program Assessment 
Rating Tool, or PART, this Administration 
has gone a step beyond the strategic 
plans required by GPRA and implemented a 
system for evaluating the performance and results 
of federal programs. The next logical 
step is to codify the requirement for a coordinated 
evidence-based review of programs. 

The PAR Act does not seek to codify the 
use of the PART specifically. Rather, this bill 
amends GPRA by establishing a requirement 
for program reviews. Specifically, the Office of 
Management and Budget, working with agency 
heads, would be required under the Act to 
review each program activity at least once 
every five years. By requiring OMB to coordinate 
this effort with the agencies we will take 
a great step forward in making the federal 
government more efficient and results oriented. 


Information gleaned from these program reviews 
needs to be useful across the board to 
all stakeholders. Members of Congress, taxpayers, 
federal managers and the Executive 
Branch need to know if programs are being 
managed effectively and if they are achieving 
the desired result. Further, this legislation, 
once enacted, will allow us to compare data 
among different agencies, to see how different 
programs with similar goals are achieving results. 
Members of Congress can use the information 
to make informed budget decisions 
and conduct more effective oversight. It will 
help the taxpayers see what they are getting 
for their money. Most important, federal managers 
will use the information to improve the 
way they manage programs. The results will 
be a more effective and efficient government 
for the good of all Americans. 

INTRODUCTION OF BILL TO DETER 
ADDITIONAL ABUSES OF PRISONERS 
AND DETAINEES IN THE 
GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM 

HON. RUSH D. HOLT 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, it has been my 
privilege since the terrorist attacks of September 
11th to visit our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Just a few days ago, I also traveled 
to Guantanamo Bay with my colleagues, U.S. 
Senator JON CORZINE and U.S. Representative 
ROBERT MENENDEZ, to investigate conditions 
at this key installation and visit with our soldiers 
on duty there, many of whom are members 
of the National Guard from our home 
state of New Jersey. Every visit I’ve made with 
our troops has added to the profound admiration 
and deep respect I have for the brave 
men and women who serve in our nation’s 
armed forces and who are prosecuting this 
very difficult global war on terrorism. 

At the same time, we do not honor the soldiers 
when we fail to investigate and call to 
account all of those up and down the chain of 

U.S. military command who are directly or indirectly 
responsible for abusing detainees 
under U.S. control. This grim reality is made 
all the clearer in an open letter delivered today 
to members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary 
Committee from a dozen top-ranking retired 
military officers in the U.S. armed services. 
They underscore that current U.S. detention 
and interrogation operations in Afghanistan, 
Iraq, Guantanamo Bay, and elsewhere have 
undermined our intelligence gathering efforts, 
and added to the risks facing our troops serving 
around the world. 
Last year, three reports that were compiled 
by U.S. Army officers and the bipartisan investigative 
commission appointed by U.S. Defense 
Secretary Rumsfeld documented in horrifying 
detail the egregious human rights 
abuses that occurred at Abu Ghraib Prison 
and other detention facilities under U.S. military 
control. Yet, the Congress failed to do our 
job, doggedly investigate how and why these 
abuses occurred, and put in place new safeguards 
for interrogations in U.S. military detention 
facilities and unfettered, independent investigations 
of prisoner treatment. As a result, 
more abuses have occurred. 

In recent weeks, more credible disclosures 
of prisoner abuses at Guantanamo and other 
sites where detainees are being held have 
come to light because of reports from the 
International Committee of the Red Cross, the 
American Civil Liberties Union, and the NYU 
Center for Human Rights and Global Justice 
and the Association of the American Bar of 
the City of New York. It is increasingly difficult 
for anybody to argue that the abusive behavior 
came from a few aberrant soldiers. Broader 
systemic problems need to be probed by this 
new Congress. Certainly, we all must concede 
that the on-going stream of new disclosures 
continues to hurt American standing in the 
global community of nations and the costs of 
these recurring, self-inflicted wounds and related 
risks to the safety of our soldiers continue 
to mount. 

That is why I am today re-introducing legislation 
I first sponsored last July H.R. 4951 in 
the 108th Congress. It is designed to help prevent 
the kinds of abuses that occurred at Abu 


E16 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 2005 

Ghraib and elsewhere at DoD-controlled pris


ons. 

My bill has three main provisions. 

First, it would require videotaping of interrogations 
and other pertinent interactions between 
U.S. personnel and/or contractors, and 
detainees arrested and held in Iraq, Afghanistan, 
Guantanamo Bay, and elsewhere, pursuant 
to the war on terrorism, as recommended 
by the Army Inspector General. The tapes 
would be kept at the appropriate level of classification. 


Second, it would ensure unfettered access 
to prisoners and detainees by representatives 
of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent, 
the UN High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, and the UN Special Rapporteur on 
Torture for independent monitoring of detainee 
conditions and treatment. 

Third, it would require the Judge Advocate 
General, pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice, to develop guidelines designed to 
ensure that the required videotaping is sufficiently 
expansive to prevent abuses of the fundamental 
human rights of detainees and prisoners 
and violations of the U.S. Constitution, 
the Geneva Conventions of 1949, and other 
bedrock U.S. and international laws. 

I am gratified that my bill has already been 
enthusiastically endorsed by Amnesty International 
Human Rights Watch, Human Rights 
First, and the American Civil Liberties Union. 
Their self explanatory letters of support follow 
this statement. I am also encouraged that the 

U.S. Army Inspector General has expressed 
support for videotaping prisoner interrogations, 
in principle, in order to better protect the fundamental 
human rights of detainees and U.S. 
soldiers from false charges at the same time. 
The abuses that occurred at Abu Ghraib 
and elsewhere never should have happened. 
They have indelibly stained the honor of our 
country and the overwhelming majority of U.S. 
troops who are defending our freedom with 
courage and personal responsibility. To whatever 
extent they continue, they aid and abet 
our enemies in the war on terrorism. I intend 
to press hard for enactment of this legislation 
during the 109th Congress.

ON ITS 5TH ANNIVERSARY 


HON. HILDA L. SOLIS 

OF CALIFORNIA

Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the San Gabriel and Lower Los 
Angeles Rivers and Mountains Conservancy 
on its 5th Anniversary and the completion of 
its first major acquisition along the San Gabriel 
River. 

I have had the privilege of working with the 
Rivers and Mountains Conservancy since I authored 
the legislation that created the Rivers 
and Mountains Conservancy during my tenure 
in the California State Senate. The Conservancy 
has brought opportunities for preservation 
of open space and habitat, low-impact 
recreation, education and watershed improvements 
to our very urban community. In the last 
five years diverse groups have come together 

for a common goal—improving the urban environment 
and providing safe recreational 
places for our families and children. 

I would also like to congratulate the Rivers 
and Mountains Conservancy for completion of 
its first major acquisition along the San Gabriel 
River. This 57 acre property fronting two miles 
of the San Gabriel River was a duck farm for 
nearly 51 years. Now, the community will be 
able to enjoy conservation, water quality 
projects, and recreation—including a local 
trailhead connecting a bike and equestrian 
path from the Angeles National Forest to the 
Pacific Ocean. 

I wish to offer the Rivers and Mountains 
Conservancy my sincerest congratulations on 
its five year anniversary and the dedication of 
the Duck Farm. I am looking forward to many 
more projects in the future so the children and 
families in the San Gabriel Valley can have 
safe places to play and enjoy the outdoors.

POSTHUMOUS TRIBUTE TO MS. 
SAMAKI VARIETY 

HON. KENDRICK B. MEEK 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
pay tribute to one of Miami’s unsung heroines, 
the late Ms. Samaki Variety, who we recently 
lost at the very young age of 47. Her passing 
on Sunday, December 19, 2004 leaves a deep 
void in our community. 

Throughout her life, Samaki raised a brave 
voice to the struggles of the poor and the 
homeless, especially those afflicted with the 
deadly virus of HIV–AIDS across our community 
and beyond. She also portrayed the unjust 
and inhumane treatment of newly arrived immigrants, 
particularly the Haitians, against the 
backdrop of policies and regulations that continue 
to negatively impact their lives to this 
very day. Samaki worked as a Community 
Outreach Coordinator to my mother, former 
Congresswoman Carrie P. Meek, where she 
was noted and loved for her dedication, effectiveness, 
positive attitude and happy spirit. I 
reserve to her the highest respect and admiration 
for her insatiable quest for simple justice 
and fairness for the less fortunate among us, 
particularly the children and the youth. 

Ms. Samaki Variety symbolized the resilient 
and unyielding voice for those who were 
disenfranchised and who bore the brunt of inequality 
of opportunity. She was a loving 
mother, an indefatigable community-builder 
and a catalyst par excellence who was completely 
unselfish in her endeavors. The authenticity 
of her stewardship on our behalf was 
defined by her utmost consecration to her calling 
as God’s faithful servant, bringing laughter, 
hope and optimism to hundreds of ordinary 
folks and countless teenagers whose lives she 
deeply touched, never holding anyone at 
arm’s length. 

This remarkable lady was our community’s 
friend and confidante. She will be an indelible 
reminder of the noble commitment and awesome 
power of community service on behalf of 
the less fortunate. Her faith was deep and 
genuine, and her love for us was real and unforgettable. 
No one who knew Samaki—and 
having been struck by her sunny disposition 
and unfailing optimism—went away un


changed. She was truly a caring and passionate 
person who brightened the lives of all 
who knew her. 

We will truly miss her, and we will never forget 
her. 

I ask that the following article from the 
Miami Herald be included in the RECORD:

FORMER OUTREACH CHIEF RAISED AIDS 

AWARENESS; SAMAKI VARIETY 

(By Monica Hatcher) 

Samaki Variety, admired for her work 
within South Florida’s HIV/AIDS community, 
died Sunday in Atlanta of pneumonia. 
She was 47. 

Variety, the former community outreach 
director for Miami Mayor Manny Diaz, 
spearheaded several city-sponsored AIDS 
events, including the Tree Lighting Ceremony 
commemorating World AIDS Day and 
the Youth March for Life, which brought 
thousands of school-age children marching 
through downtown last year to raise AIDS 
awareness. 

‘‘Her passion for HIV education may have 
had a great deal to do with the amount of 
HIV we see in the black community here,’’ 
said Alex Paulmer, who worked with Variety 
on AIDS-related projects. Variety was born 
in San Francisco and studied psychology and 
social science at Fort Valley State University. 
After college, she met Lee Variety. The 
couple married and moved to Miami in the 
mid-1970s. The couple worked as entertainers 
and owned Boo-key Productions, which 
booked and promoted acts. 

‘‘She had a gift for singing, dancing and 
acting, but God also gave her a gift for helping 
people,’’ recalled her mother, Annie 
Lacy. In the late 1980s, Variety used her talents 
and her own money to host a Saturday 
radio youth talk show on 1490 WMBM called 
‘‘What’s on Your Mind.’’ The call-in program, 
aimed at teenagers, tackled such 
issues as pregnancy and child abuse. Samaki 
and Lee Variety had two children together, 
Leronce and Dom’Unique. The couple later 
divorced. 

‘‘She had a high spirit and was a positive 
thinker,’’ said Dom’Unique, 14. ‘‘She was 
dedicated to her job and loved to help people 
and she pushed people to be the best they 
can be.’’ 

Variety worked in the public sector as an 
aide to Congresswoman Carrie Meek for five 
years. ‘‘She was a rare combination of talent, 
intelligence and ability,’’ said U.S. Rep. 
Kendrick Meek, who knew Samaki when she 
worked with his mother. Variety worked for 
a time in the Miami-Dade County School 
System and with former County Commissioner 
Charles Dusseau. 

In 2002, she joined Diaz’s office of Faith-
Based Initiatives and Community Outreach. 
‘‘Samaki will be deeply missed by all of the 
people she encountered and the many, many 
lives she touched,’’ Diaz said in a statement. 
Variety left the mayor’s office in October to 
care for her mother in Georgia. 

In addition to her mother and children, Variety 
is surved by a grandmother, Nazaree 
Foster; brothers, Roland and Wayman 
Hindsman; and sisters Jaqueline Shire, 
Jakki Kidd and Betty Wallace, as well as 
three grandchildren.

HIGHER EDUCATION AFFORDABILITY 
AND FAIRNESS ACT 

HON. RUSH D. HOLT 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, today, education— 
and higher education in particular—is more 
important than ever to solving the most pressing 
problems of our communities and the 
country. 

Let me give you some sobering statistics: 

According to Nellie Mae, the average undergraduate 
student loan debt has increased the 
last 5 years from $11,400 to $18,900. 

Today, 70 percent of federal student aid is 
made in loans; Grants account for only 22 percent 
of aid. Thirty years ago, student loans accounted 
for about 25 percent and grants about 
70 percent of all federal student aid. 

Seventy-five percent of full-time students 
now work to help cover their college expenses. 
Twenty percent of working students 
work 35 or more hours a week while enrolled 
in school full-time. 

In 1975–76 the maximum Pell Grant award 
covered eighty-four percent of an average tuition 
at a state school; today it covers forty percent. 


The generation often referred to as the 
‘‘baby boom echo’’ will soon enter American 
institutions of higher education, resulting in 
record enrollments that will further strain the 
ability of colleges and universities to deliver a 
quality education to their students. 

That is why I am introducing the Higher 
Education Affordability and Fairness Act. 

It would make college tuition deductible, in 
conjunction with existing tax benefits for higher 
education. The proposal would further allow a 
family to deduct up to $10,000 in tuition expenses. 
A family would be capped at deducting 
a total of $15,000 in tuition expenses in 
one year if they have more than one child in 
college. In addition, if a family was ineligible 
for the Hope Scholarship (due to its income 
limitations), they would be able to deduct 
$5,000 of tuition costs. 

The bill would raise the income limits for eligibility 
for Hope Scholarships. Currently, the 
income phase-out on the HOPE tax credit is 
$40,000 to $50,000 for singles and $80,000 to 
$100,000 for couples. The proposal would 
raise the phase-out ranges to $50,000 to 
$60,000 for singles and $100,000 to $120,000 
for couples, allowing more families to benefit. 

In order to ensure that savings go to the intended 
beneficiaries, the bill directs the In


spector General of the Department of Education 
to conduct an annual study to examine 
whether the federal income tax incentives to 
provide education assistance affect higher 
education tuition rates. 

Access to an affordable, quality education is 
inseparable from our economic prosperity, national 
security, and civic health. We must do 
everything possible to support this and that is 
why I have introduced the Higher Education 
Affordability and Fairness Act.

After beginning in 1981 at Chabot College, 
the Puente Project has flourished and grown. 
Today it is conducted in over 50 community 
colleges and 35 high schools across the State 
of California. Under the leadership of Mr. 
Galaviz, the Puente Project has shown consistent 
results and helped students achieve 
their higher education goals. 

Mr. Galaviz has used his wonderful ability to 
educate and counsel Latino youth to work 
throughout his career. Furthermore, he has 
strived to share that gift with others, often conducting 
presentations to help others learn how 
to counsel and mentor Latino youth. 

I wish to congratulate Mr. Galaviz on his inspirational 
work. He was a priceless asset in 
the field of education. I know him personally 
and am very familiar with his work. I wish him 
the best of luck in his future endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSWOMAN 
SHIRLEY CHISHOLM 

HON. KENDRICK B. MEEK 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman 
Chisholm charted a whole new 
course for black Americans. She was the first 
black woman elected to Congress and paved 
the way for dozens who came after her, including 
my mother, former U.S. Rep. Carrie P. 
Meek. Shirley Chisholm was a founding member 
of the Congressional Black Caucus, a pioneer 
in civil and women’s rights issues, and 
was the first black of either gender to run for 
President of the United States. 

Her determination and passion for the 
issues she believed in was always perfectly 
packaged by her charm and eloquence. The 
daughter of Caribbean immigrants, she never 
ceased to push for a better country for all 
Americans. 

Congresswoman Chisholm is an inspiration 
to me and every Member of Congress. Her 

legacy will never be forgotten, and I will always 
consider her path-breaking career as a 
motivation to serve the people of Florida’s 
17th Congressional District as best I can.

ON THE RETIREMENT OF COL 

THOMAS W. SHUBERT FROM THE 

UNITED STATES AIR FORCE 

HON. BOB GOODLATTE 

OF VIRGINIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on the occasion 
of his retirement from the United States 
Air Force, I want to take this opportunity to 
honor Col ‘‘Tom’’ Shubert for his 30 years of 
dedicated service to our country. In his most 
recent assignment he served as the Chief, 
Congressional Inquiries Division, Office of 
Legislative Liaison. He managed, on behalf of 
the Department of the Air Force, all constituent 
inquiries from the White House, Office 
of the Vice President, Members of Congress 
and state and local governments. 

Colonel Shubert began his illustrious Air 
Force career as a distinguished graduate of 
the Reserve Officers Training Corps at East 
Carolina University and was commissioned in 
1974. Following graduation from Undergraduate 
Pilot Training in 1975, his operational 
assignments included piloting B–52 strategic 
bombers and T–39 airlift support mission aircraft 
both in the United States and in the Far 
East. 

From April 1986 to April 1989, Colonel 
Shubert served as a Political-Military Affairs 
Officer on the Joint Staff at Headquarters, 
United States Pacific Command. He then 
served as the Assistant Air Attache´ for Operations 
at the American Embassy in Canberra, 
Australia until June of 1993. Colonel Shubert 
was then assigned as a Congressional Inquires 
Liaison in the Congressional Inquiry Division, 
Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, 
Department of the Air Force. 

In June 1995, Colonel Shubert entered Danish 
language training and then served as the 
Air Attache´ at the American Embassy in Copenhagen, 
Denmark from December 1995 to 
July 1998. He then returned to the Pentagon, 
where he served as the Military Assistant to 
the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative 
Affairs, Office of the Secretary of Defense, 
until October 2000. 

From October 2000 to June 2002, Colonel 
Shubert headed the Assessments Branch, 
Policy Division, Defense Technology Security 
Administration, which reviewed both Munitions 
and Dual-Use export license applications. 

In July 2003, Colonel Shubert assumed duties 
as the Chief of the Congressional Inquiry 
Division, Office of Legislative Liaison, Secretary 
of the Air Force. During this time, Colonel 
Shubert escorted scores of Members of 
Congress on more than twenty Congressional 
Delegations, in furtherance of Members’ oversight 
responsibilities. 

Colonel Shubert assisted me and Members 
of the Committee on Agriculture during trips to 
Afghanistan, Iraq, and, last year, to Africa. He 
upheld the highest standards of professional 
conduct and his thorough and efficient planning 
assured that these trips were a complete 
success. He will be missed. 

Colonel Shubert holds a Bachelor of Arts in 
Political Science (Honor Graduate) from East 


E18 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 2005 

Carolina University, a Master of Science in 
Systems Management from the University of 
Southern California, and a Master of Arts Degree 
in National Security Affairs from the 
Naval Postgraduate School. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask that my Colleagues join 
me in expressing our sincere appreciation to 
COL Tom Shubert for his outstanding service 
to both the Legislative and Executive 
Branches and to the United States Air Force. 

I wish him, his wife Kathy, and their daughters 
Victoria and Joanna, the very best as they 
face new challenges in the coming years. I will 
miss his unfailing good humor and hard work. 
Colonel Shubert has consistently conducted 
himself in a professional manner and therefore 
brings great credit to the United States Air 
Force.

REINTRODUCTION OF 
LEGISLATION 

HON. CLIFF STEARNS 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
on this first day of the 109th Congress to introduce 
several pieces of legislation that I have 
been pursuing over the years, and for which I 
will continue to advocate these next two years. 

First, I am excited to again introduce legislation 
to help all American savers. My legislation, 
the Simple Savings Tax Relief Act of 
2005, simply eliminates the taxation of interest 
earned in savings accounts, such as passbook 
savings accounts or bank certificates of deposit. 
I think at least some of this interest 
should be tax-free, as we have been working 
towards for other forms of non-earned income. 
This legislation would end a punitive tax, especially 
assist low and middle-income earners, 
and ultimately contribute toward the goal of 
encouraging individual responsibility and taking 
charge of one’s own financial destiny. 

Next, for years I have authored legislation to 
repeal the 2 percent excise tax on private 
foundations. The United States is blessed with 
a deep spirit of philanthropy, and charitable organizations 
serve the interest of both the individual 
and the community. Under current law, 
however, not-for-profit private foundations generally 
must pay to the IRS a 2 percent excise 
tax on their net investment income, which diverts 
from the purposes for which these foundations 
were founded. Optimistically, this body 
passed a reduction of this charitable impediment 
to 1 percent in the 108th (H.R. 7), but as 
it failed to become law, I am reintroducing this 
legislation and we shall try again. 

Next, I am pleased to again sponsor the 
Health Care Tax Deduction Act of 2005. This 
would allow deductions for amounts paid for 
health insurance premiums and unreimbursed 
prescription drugs. This would provide much-
needed relief to individuals struggling with the 
high cost of health insurance and prescription 
drugs through a tax deduction, and tax parity 
with those of us who have employer-provided 
tax-deductible health insurance. Expansively, 
this benefit extends to all IRS-defined health 
insurance premiums such as an HMO, PPO, a 
traditional indemnity plan, a new HSA, and 
also long-term care premiums. Right now, 
under the current tax code, in order to claim 
health care expenses individuals must file an 

itemized tax return. My bill would simplify and 
extend this tax preference for all filers. 

I also am reintroducing the Allied Health Reinvestment 
Act of 2005, along with my friend 
Dr. Strickland from Ohio. This important legislation 
offers incentives via scholarships and 
loans to encourage students and faculty to 
enter the essential but undersupplied allied 
health professions, such as physical, occupational, 
and speech rehabilitation, and medical 
and radiological technologists to name a few. 

Also, with an eye towards the value of 
human life, I reintroduce my Human Cloning 
Research Prohibition Act, which restricts federal 
funding and encourages other nations to 
do so as well. 

Finally, I am pleased to reintroduce a resolution 
supporting the goals and ideals of establishing 
a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary 
Disease (COPD) awareness month. I do this 
again with my friend Mr. Lewis of Georgia. In 
past Congresses, this bill has had tremendous 
support from Members and from the U.S. 
COPD Coalition, which comprises the patient 
and provider community. The House passed 
this legislation in the summer of 2003, and we 
started a bicameral Caucus in the winter of 
2004 to advance our efforts. COPD is an umbrella 
term used to describe the airflow obstruction 
associated mainly with emphysema 
and chronic bronchitis. This is a debilitating 
disease, that is currently the nation’s fourth 
leading cause of death, and I am proud to 
bring awareness to COPD. 

I look forward to working with my colleagues 
on all these important pieces of business for 
the nation.

HONORING ALBERT ASHBROOK 

FOR HIS SERVICE AS LICKING 

COUNTY COMMISSIONER 

HON. PATRICK J. TIBERI 

OF OHIO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, Mr. NEY and I 
wish to join many of our constituents in Licking 
County, Ohio in congratulating Albert 
Ashbrook, who is retiring after more than 16 
years of service as a county commissioner. 

Albert’s work was summed up best recently 
by a former colleague, who noted that Albert 
never shied away from the tough issues and 
was always looking out for the best interests 
of the people and county government. We 
would add that he did so not only with a plain 
spoken dedication to duty, but also a tremendous 
sense of humor. 

Licking County has grown and changed for 
the better during Albert’s tenure. He’s helped 
with the creation of a Domestic Relations 
Court, a one-stop employment service and improved 
auto licensing and titling facilities, just 
to name a few of the projects in which he has 
had a hand. At the same time, he’s always 
made fiscal responsibility a top priority. 

Public service has been a way of life for Albert. 
Prior to his work as a commissioner, he 
served in various capacities with the Soil and 
Water Conservation District, and is a member 
of the District Hall of Fame. 

Although he’s leaving the commissioners’ 
office, Albert is hoping to continue his community 
involvement as a member of the Licking 
County Planning Commission. In any event, 

we know he’ll still be there to offer guidance 
and advice to anyone with the good sense to 
seek it. 

We are honored to have this opportunity to 
thank Albert for all his hard work, and wish 
him and his wife Shirley many more active 
years together.

IN HONOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF 

TEXAS LONGHORNS ROSE BOWL 

CHAMPIONS 

HON. LAMAR S. SMITH 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the University 
of Texas Longhorns, playing in the 
Rose Bowl for the first time in the team’s 110-
year history, made the New Year’s Day game 
a memorable one. 

Twice the Longhorns came from behind the 
Michigan Wolverines to win 38–37 as the 
clock ran out in what many contend was the 
most exciting Rose Bowl ever. UT Quarterback 
Vince Young rushed for 192 yards and 
four touchdowns, a Rose Bowl record. He also 
threw for 180 yards and a touchdown. This 
capped a 10–1 regular season record. 

The University of Texas has a great football 
team, coached by Mack Brown. But it has a 
great academic reputation, too. 

Led by President Larry Faulkner, UT recently 
was ranked as the 15th best university 
in the world by the Times of London newspaper. 
Among U.S. public universities, only 
the University of California at Berkeley was 
listed ahead of UT. 

It’s a pleasure to cite the strengths of UT. 
It’s also a pleasure to represent such a premiere 
University in Congress.

HONORING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY 

OF THE MINNESOTA STATE CAP


ITOL 

HON. MARK R. KENNEDY 

OF MINNESOTA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. KENNEDY of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker I 
rise today to honor the 100th birthday of the 
Minnesota State Capitol. The Capitol first 
opened its doors on January 2, 1905 and on 
January 2, 2005, over 6,000 people attended 
the first of a full year’s worth of birthday celebrations. 


The Minnesota State Legislature first met in 
a log hotel when Minnesota was declared a 
territory in 1849. The first Capitol building was 
built in 1853, but burned in 1881. The second, 
built in 1882, was erected on the same downtown 
St. Paul site as the first. As Minnesota’s 
population grew, officials realized that the 
building would soon be too small to house the 
Legislators and a new building would be needed. 
In 1895, Cass Gilbert from St. Paul was 
selected to design the new building. It took 
nine years and $4.5 million to complete construction 
of the new capitol, which is still in 
use today. 

Today, the Minnesota State Capitol building 
is more than just a place for the Legislature. 
It is a museum dedicated to preserving Minnesota’s 
history. Its many priceless artifacts

Mr. Speaker, for the past 100 years the Minnesota 
State Capitol has served as a place of 
government, history and learning. As a fourth 
generation Minnesotan whose ancestors were 
well established in the state when this capitol 
was built, I am pleased to be able to help 
honor it today as a lasting symbol of the spirit 
of Minnesota.

HONORING LANCE CORPORAL 
GREGORY PAUL RUND 

HON. THOMAS G. TANCREDO 

OF COLORADO 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. TANCREDO. Mr. Speaker, it is with 
deep regret and heartfelt admiration that I rise 
today to honor a fallen Marine from my district, 
Lance Corporal Gregory Paul Rund of Littleton. 
Sadly, Lance Corporal Rund was killed in 
the line of duty during combat operations on 
December 11 in the Al Anbar Province of Iraq. 

Lance Corporal Rund was with Company I, 
3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, Regimental 
Combat Team 1, 1st Marine Division 
based in Camp Pendleton, California. 

He was just 21 years old. 

Greg was a 2002 graduate of Columbine 
High School in Jefferson County, where he 
played football and later made the decision to 
serve his country by joining the Marines. Greg 
was serving his second tour of duty in Iraq 
when he was killed. He made an indelible impression 
on all who knew him, and will be remembered 
as a dedicated, energetic and 
warm person who had a great sense of 
humor. 

Mr. Speaker, my deepest sympathies and 
heartfelt condolences go out to the family and 
friends of Lance Corporal Rund. He served his 
country honorably and with distinction, making 
the ultimate sacrifice fighting for freedom and 
democracy in defense of a grateful nation. He 
will be missed by all who knew and loved him. 

Americans owe him a great debt of gratitude. 
His dedication and bravery will not be 
forgotten.

THE STOP COUNTERFEITING IN 
MANUFACTURED GOODS ACT 

HON. JOE KNOLLENBERG 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. KNOLLENBERG. Mr. Speaker, today I 
am reintroducing legislation—the Stop Counterfeiting 
in Manufactured Goods Act. This bipartisan 
bill addresses the problem of counterfeit 
manufactured goods. I hope my colleagues 
will join me in passing this bill at the 
earliest opportunity. 

The problem of counterfeit manufactured 
goods is a growing problem around the world 
that threatens public safety and harms our 
economy here at home. Too often, counterfeit 
goods steal sales from legitimate American 
manufacturers and cost Americans high-paying 
manufacturing jobs. In fact, according to 

the U.S. Customs Service and Border Protection, 
counterfeiting costs the U.S. an estimated 
$200 billion annually. 

Manufacturers in this country are the most 
efficient and technologically advanced in the 
world, but they face many challenges. The 
biggest challenges are the costs they directly 
cannot control. We need to focus on measures 
that alleviate these costs, and crack 
down on those criminals that break the rules 
and drive up costs, thereby stealing manufacturing 
companies of what is rightfully theirs. 

Counterfeiting is not just about lost sales 
and jobs, however. It is a means by which the 
most nefarious organizations finance their activities. 
Interpol Secretary General Ronald 
Noble has stated that ‘‘we know that al-Qaeda 
supporters have been found with commercial 
size volume of counterfeit goods.’’ 

It is my belief, and that of a broad coalition 
backing this legislation, that to address the 
scourge of counterfeiting, the U.S. Government 
must possess additional tools. That is 
exactly what my bill provides. 

The Stop Counterfeit in Manufactured 
Goods Act strengthens the federal trademark 
law used to prosecute counterfeiters with two 
key provisions. 

First, the bill provides for the mandatory destruction 
of the equipment used to manufacture 
and package counterfeit goods. Under 
current law, counterfeiters can have their illegal 
goods seized, but retain the equipment 
they used to make them. We should not leave 
counterfeiters in business, and this provision 
will help us dig up the roots of counterfeiting 
networks. 

The bill also clarifies that Title 18, Section 
2320, prohibits trafficking in counterfeit labels, 
patches, and medallions that are unattached 
to any goods. Sophisticated counterfeiters 
have sold counterfeit versions of the trademarks 
themselves in the form of patch sets or 
medallions that can later be attached to generic 
merchandises and given the appearance 
of a genuine product. This is counterfeiting 
and should not stand. 

The Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured 
Goods Act will have a positive impact here in 
the United States and end the merciless stealing 
of American jobs and sales. In fact, the 
Department of Justice’s Task Force on Intellectual 
Property cites this bill as a measure 
that would increase the effectiveness of intellectual 
property enforcement. 

The bill’s reach will also be global. The Office 
of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) 
is currently engaged in a variety of bilateral 
and multilateral trade negotiations. However, 
USTR cannot readily negotiate criminal anti-
counterfeiting standards above the levels 
found in the United States. By passing this bill 
into law, we will empower our negotiators to 
press for stronger anti-counterfeiting measures 
from our trading partners. The U.S. must lead 
by example in intellectual property rights enforcement 
and this is a critical step we must 
take. Clearly, the passage of the Stop Counterfeit 
of Manufactured Goods Act is long 
overdue. 

I thank the bipartisan group of Members for 
joining as original cosponsors of this legislation. 
I encourage all my colleagues to join us 
in cracking down on the counterfeit goods that 
threaten public safety, steal sales from legitimate 
manufacturers, and cost American jobs. 

I look forward to working with my colleagues 
to expeditiously pass this legislation into law. 

Mr. Speaker, I submit the following letter on 
this issue for the RECORD:

DEAR CONGRESSMAN KNOLLENBERG: The organizations 
listed above write in support of 
your legislation to strengthen the criminal 
statute against trafficking in counterfeited 
goods. This bill would amend the U.S. Code, 
18 U.S.C. 2320, by closing existing loopholes 
that can allow counterfeiters to avoid prosecution, 
maintain control of assets for criminal 
enterprises, and unjustly profit from 
their illegal activities. This legislation 
would grant trademark owners remedies 
similar to those already provided to copyright 
and trade secret owners. 

Acts of counterfeiting result in significant 
economic harm in the form of lost profits, diminished 
reputation among consumers, and 
decreased tax revenue. The FBI estimates 
that counterfeiting costs U.S. businesses $200 
billion to $250 billion annually and is increasing 
rapidly. New York City estimates 
that in 2003 alone, the theft of intellectual 
property cost the city over $1 billion in lost 
tax revenue. Another frightening trend relates 
to the rising occurrence of substandard 
and dangerous counterfeit goods that present 
severe public health and safety risks. Numerous 
deaths and injuries have already been attributed 
to counterfeit products. Finally, 
and perhaps most alarmingly, there-is 
strong evidence suggesting that organized 
criminal groups and terrorist organizations 
are increasingly involved in criminal counterfeiting 
schemes. 

Existing domestic laws should be bolstered 
to effectively address this problem. Your bill 
would strengthen those laws by prohibiting 
the trafficking in counterfeit labels, patches, 
stickers, hangtags, or medallions that are 
unattached to goods. In addition, the bill 
would make mandatory the forfeiture and 
destruction of counterfeit goods, as well as 
the assets used to produce, package, and distribute 
counterfeit goods, and requires the 
forfeiture of property and assets derived 
from counterfeiting. 

Internationally, the World Customs Organization 
and Interpol estimate that the annual 
global trade in illegitimate goods has 
increased from $5.5 billion in 1982 to roughly 
$600 billion today and it continues to grow. 
Ambassador Zoellick, the U.S. Trade Representative, 
recently characterized trademark 
counterfeiting, along with copyright 
piracy, as a ‘‘scourge on the global economy.’’ 


Immediate passage of this legislation is 
necessary to more effectively combat counterfeiting 
abroad. The Office of the U.S. 
Trade Representative advises that it will not 
negotiate criminal anti-counterfeiting 
standards above the levels found in current

A TRIBUTE TO SISTER MARY 
BURNS 

HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ ZQUEZ 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
would like to pay tribute to a remarkable 
woman from my Congressional District, and 
wish her the best as she begins a new chapter 
of her life. Sister Mary Burns has spent 
more than a decade honoring the lives of 
Maura Clarke and Ita Ford, Maryknoll Sisters 
who were killed in 1980 while working to assist 
the poor in El Salvador. I am pleased to 
take this opportunity to honor her and her own 
work on behalf of economically disadvantaged 
women. 

In 1993, Sister Mary Burns founded the 
Maura Clarke-Ita Ford Center (MCIF) in one of 
New York City’s most impoverished communities, 
the Bushwick neighborhood in Brooklyn. 
The center provides education and training to 
low-income, mainly Hispanic, women. Under 
the leadership of Sister Mary Burns, MCIF has 
thrived—providing personal development, education 
and economic independence, and empowering 
women to break the cycle of poverty. 

Like many Irish women who grew up in 
South Boston, Sister Mary Burns is strong and 
resilient, a person with deep faith and a wicked 
sense of humor. She is generous of heart 
and giving to her core. And her work on behalf 
on disadvantaged women is as impassioned 
as it is pioneering. 

Bushwick was devastated during the riots of 
the late 1970s, and severe poverty and unemployment 
continues to plague the neighborhood. 
MCIF offers residents literacy classes, 
GED instruction, and job training. Recognizing 
the desperate need for entry level jobs in the 
Bushwick area, MCIF initiated an innovative 
program to create a small clothing factory in 
the neighborhood to offer low income women 
employment earning a livable wage, day care 
services, and the opportunity to attain business 
development and leadership skills. 

MCIF also has a kitchen incubator to help 
new entrepreneurs develop the skills and experience 
necessary to launch successful small 
businesses in the food industry. Similarly, the 
center is home to a bakery program where 
local women put their skills to work baking 
cookies. Sales from these cookies, which on 

their own are well worth a trip to Bushwick, 
are used to support the program and compensate 
the bakers for their hard work—providing 
a path to economic independence. 

These programs serve as an important 
model on how to strengthen communities one 
person and one family at a time. And its 
through the dedication and drive of Sister 
Mary Burns that the women who enter the 
doors of MCIF leave believing in themselves, 
envisioning promising futures, and chartering 
successful lives for their families. 

I am honored to have worked with Sister 
Mary Burns over the years in advancing the 
mission of MCIF. Under her guidance, the 
center has become a critical resource for 
some, a sanctuary for others, and a source of 
inspiration for all who witness its extraordinary 
work. I, along with so many residents of the 
community, will miss her dearly. But her principles 
of loving acceptance, unwavering encouragement, 
and enduring faith are now firmly 
embedded in the spirit of the community— 
and families from Bushwick will benefit from 
her work for generations to come. It is in this 
light Mr. Speaker, that I ask my House colleagues 
to join me in honoring the remarkable 
contributions of Sister Mary Burns and wishing 
her the best of luck in her future endeavors.

Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
join my colleagues in introducing H.R. 240, the 
Personal Responsibility, Work and Family Promotion 
Act of 2005. This legislation reauthorizes 
and strengthens the successful welfare 
reforms begun in the 1996 welfare reform law 

(P.L. 104–193). Joining me introducing this 
legislation are Representatives PRYCE, THOMAS, 
BOEHNER, BARTON, GOODLATTE, MCKEON, 
BILIRAKIS, DELAY, SHAW, CANTOR, ENGLISH, 
CAMP, NANCY JOHNSON, WELLER, NORWOOD, 
JOE WILSON and KLINE. 
Welfare reform has been a great success in 
promoting work, ending dependence, and reducing 
poverty. Millions more low-income parents 
are working today instead of depending 
on welfare, offering brighter prospects for their 
family’s future. Since the implementation of 
welfare reform in 1996, welfare caseloads 
dropped by more than 50 percent nation-
wide—leading more than two million families 
and seven million former recipients to rely on 
themselves, rather than depend on a check 
from the government. More than 1 million children 
have been lifted out of poverty since reform, 
and poverty rates for black children and 
children living with single mothers reached— 
and despite the 2001 recession still remain 
near—all time lows. Recent reports linked 
work-based welfare reforms with reduced parental 
substance abuse (http:// 
www.affiliatedsystems.com/newest.htm) and 
child poverty (http://www.manhattan institute.
org/html/crl44.htm). 

Still, despite this success nearly 2 million 
families remain dependent on welfare for support, 
and relatively few of those parents are 
working or getting training in skills needed to 
lift their families out of poverty. That needs to 

improve. Plus too many families break up or 
never form, leaving millions of children and 
parents at risk of welfare dependence in the 
future. 

H.R. 240 as introduced today will help even 
more low-income parents and families support 
themselves, including through stepped up efforts 
to strengthen families and support 
healthy marriages that are the best environment 
for raising children. H.R. 240 would extend 
TANF and related programs through fiscal 
year 2010, and makes selected changes to 
promote more work and stronger families, including 
healthy marriages. 
In 2002 and 2003, the U.S. House passed 
earlier versions of this legislation. However, 
since the U.S. Senate failed to pass companion 
legislation, comprehensive welfare reauthorization 
legislation was not signed into 
law. Instead, the President signed eight short 
extensions of current law, the most recent of 
which expires on March 31, 2005. H.R. 240 as 
introduced today is an updated version of legislation 
the House passed in 2002 and 2003, 
which will serve as the basis for hearings and 
other consideration during the early days of 
the 109th Congress. 

I look forward to working together with my 
Republican and Democrat colleagues to craft 
the best possible welfare reauthorization policy, 
building on the foundation of the current 
system and the proposals the House passed 
in recent years. We will hold hearings to examine 
features of today’s welfare policy that 
are working, and those that are in need of improvement. 
In tight budget times, it will take all 
of our efforts to ensure that welfare reform 
continues to be successful. As the 1996 reforms 
have proven, however, we can help 
more parents work, reduce dependence on 
government benefits, cut poverty, and still protect 
taxpayers’ interests at the same time. Before 
1996, hardly anyone thought we could do 
all that, and now we have a track record of 
getting it done. We need to build on that successful 
record, which H.R. 240 would do. 

I encourage all my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to support this important legislation.

TRIBUTE TO BEA WEISBROD 

HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 

OF TEXAS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON. Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me 
to pay tribute today to one of the most respected 
community leaders in Dallas, Texas: 
Bea Weisbrod. 

The name Bea Weisbrod has long been associated 
with excellence and one of our highest 
standards of civic pride. Bea Weisbrod, on 
December 5, 2004 received the Bnai Zion’s 
Lifetime service award. Bea is founding member 
of Bnai Zion-Texas Region and a long-
time member of Congregation Shearith Israel. 
Her many years of community service and 
dedication to making a difference in the lives 
of people in our community, as well, as in 
Israel are truly deserving of our appreciation 
and praise. 

In addition to her professional associations, 
Bea Weisbrod selflessly devotes her personal 
time to numerous organizations including the 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E21 

Hadassah where she serves on the regional 
board. 

Mr. Speaker, I commend the Bnai Zion 
Foundation on its excellent selection of Bea 
Weisbrod for its lifetime service award, and I 
wish her sons Les, Carl, and their loving family 
continued success in all of their endeavors. 

I know that Bea Weisbrod will continue to 
play an important role in our community for 
decades to come, and that America will continue 
to benefit from her dedication, service 
and hard work.

HONORING HOMER CADDELL 
‘‘CAL’’ HENDERSON, JR. 

HON. JIM DAVIS 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. DAVIS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Homer Caddell ‘‘Cal’’ Henderson Jr., 
who is retiring today after 12 years of loyal 
service as Sheriff of Hillsborough County, Florida. 


Cal dedicated his life to keeping our community 
safe. At 21, Cal began his law enforcement 
career in the Tampa Police Department, 
and he went on to serve the U.S. Border Patrol 
and the CIA as a national police trainer in 
Vietnam. In 1969, when Cal returned home to 
Tampa, he joined the Hillsborough County 
Sheriff’s Office. 

During his 35 years in the Sheriff’s Office, 
Cal Henderson experienced a period of enormous 
growth and development in Hillsborough 
County. The year Cal joined the force, the 
Sheriff’s Office employed 157 deputies serving 
a mostly rural area. In fact, at that time, Cal 
was the only deputy working in his region of 
eastern Hillsborough. Today, as Sheriff Henderson 
retires, his office employs 1,200 deputies, 
950 sworn detention officers and 1,000 
civilians, and the territory that he once patrolled 
alone is now served by as many as 12 
deputies. 

Cal Henderson worked his way through the 
ranks of the Sheriff’s office, and he was able 
to do it while adapting to colossal changes in 
the needs of our community. Following the 
September 11 tragedies, Sheriff Henderson 
recognized the need to coordinate the efforts 
of our region’s first responders, and he spearheaded 
the Tampa Bay Regional Domestic 
Security Task Force. A model for communities 
nationwide, the task force brings together fire 
fighters, EMS, hospital, port, police and sheriff 
and other officers to streamline efforts to keep 
our region safe. 

Fortunately for the people of Hillsborough 
County, Sheriff Henderson is leaving us well 
equipped for the transition to new leadership 
under incoming Sheriff David Gee. And while 
Cal may be hanging up his Sheriff’s badge, 
we can rest assured that he will continue his 
service to our community. Cal has already indicated 
that while taking advantage of some 
well deserved rest in retirement, he is also 
planning to assist the U.S. Department of Justice’s 
Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention on issues pertaining to 
missing and exploited children. 

Hillsborough County has truly been blessed 
to have Sheriff Cal Henderson as a faithful 
public servant. Cal has served with honor and 
integrity and has always shown the highest re


spect for those he serves. On behalf of our 
community, I would like to extend my deepest 
appreciation for his commitment and my best 
wishes for his retirement.

INTRODUCTION OF THE RAIL AND 

PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECU


RITY ACT 

HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, today I am 
pleased to introduce the Rail and Public 
Transportation Security Act, which would force 
the federal government to finally get serious 
about protecting our nation’s transit and intercity 
rail passengers. 

This bill addresses the tremendous disparity 
between what we spend on security for each 
airline passenger and what we spend for each 
bus and train passenger, who are no less vulnerable 
than those who fly. In fact, data from 
the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention 
of Terrorism shows that public transportation 
passengers are in far more danger 
worldwide than airline passengers. Since 9/11, 
there have been over five times as many attacks 
on public transportation targets around 
the world than on aviation targets, with nearly 
ten times the number of fatalities. 

The recent attacks in Spain, and intelligence 
that terrorists may strike the rail and transit 
systems here in America, dictate that we now 
broaden our attention to also include rail and 
transit security. Each year, approximately 24 
million intercity rail passengers ride Amtrak, 
and 9.6 billion people travel by transit. Every 
day, 32 million commuters, students, and tourists 
depend on our public transportation system. 
One of the ripple effects of 9/11 was that 
the aviation industry was shut down for several 
days. Imagine the social and economic 
dislocation that would occur if a major attack 
destroyed people’s confidence in our transit 
system, or made it grind to a halt. The economic 
impact would be far greater than 9/11. 

Our nation’s rail and transit systems are 
highly vulnerable, and require at least $5.2 billion 
in capital equipment and $800 million in 
annual operating expenses to adequately 
meet security needs, according to the American 
Public Transportation Association. This 
legislation provides that funding, and just as 
importantly, it allows operating expense grant 
money to be used for the best security device 
of all: more police officers. 

Giving our transit agencies money for 
fences, cameras and explosive detection 
equipment is necessary, but only a half-measure 
unless we also give them money for the 
cops and security officers that make all that 
equipment work. This bill allows money to be 
used for hiring new cops and security officers, 
pay them overtime when necessary, deploy 
additional K–9 units, conduct helicopter patrols, 
and more. In short, it unties the hands of 
our transit agencies and lets them spend the 
money where they need it. 

This legislation also provides badly needed 
security and safety funding for Amtrak, including 
$670 million for safety upgrades to the tunnels 
that run underneath New York, Baltimore, 
and Washington D.C. These tunnels are simply 
not properly equipped for rescue oper


ations or evacuation should either be necessary. 
An additional $62 million for Amtrak to 
put towards security expenses, including the 
hiring of additional police officers, is also provided. 


Mr. Speaker, this bill would authorize new 
research and development grants to help develop 
new technologies for both passenger 
and freight rail that can help reduce the threat 
of terrorist attacks. And since rail security involves 
more than just deterring terrorist attacks, 
the legislation would establish new inspection 
procedures for rail track, and set new 
standards for tank cars, to make sure their 
hazardous cargo isn’t released in the event of 
an accident. 

I believe this bill is already long overdue. I 
urge my colleagues to imagine what we would 
have done, what action we would have taken, 
if the Madrid train bombings had occurred in 
our homeland, on our soil. What immediate investments 
would we have been ready to 
make? What urgent action would we have 
been willing to take? 

Well, we can do it now. Let’s make that investment 
and take those actions now. Let’s 
take what steps we can to reduce the risk to 
our nation’s transit. We don’t need commissions 
and studies after a tragedy in order to 
act, so let’s not get mired in that now. Nearly 
three years of needs assessment and analysis 
have occurred, and we have the data to put a 
program in place. All it takes is Congress having 
the gumption to act before a tragedy on 
the rails takes place in this country.

HONORING METROPOLITAN 
ANTHONY 

HON. MICHAEL BILIRAKIS 

OF FLORIDA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to the spiritual leader of the Greek 
Orthodox Metropolis of San Francisco, Metropolitan 
Anthony, who recently passed away. 

Metropolitan Anthony ascended to great 
heights from very modest beginnings. He was 
born on the Greek island of Crete, one of six 
children struggling to grow up under the brutal 
Nazi occupation of the island. He became the 
first member of his family to leave his village, 
ultimately graduating in 1960 from the prestigious 
Halki Theological School of the Ecumenical 
Patriarchate of Constantinople. He 
came to the United States after his ordination 
to the priesthood to serve the Church in this 
country. 

Metropolitan Anthony was elected Bishop of 
San Francisco in 1979. He served as Bishop 
and later Metropolitan of the Diocese of San 
Francisco, which covers seven western states, 
for more than 25 years. He was responsible 
for a significant expansion of ministries and 
programs during his tenure. He oversaw the 
founding of more than 25 new parishes and 
missions, as well as the establishment of three 
monasteries. He also developed the annual 
Metropolis Folk Dance Festival, the largest exhibition 
of authentic Greek folk dance, costume, 
and music in the world. In addition, he 
established a multi-million dollar endowment 
fund to provide scholarships for seminarians 
and theological students to attend holy school. 

Mr. Speaker, Metropolitan Anthony inspired 
many because he was a great leader and devout 
man of faith. He challenged the faithful

not only to dream great dreams but to make 
them a reality. I hope our colleagues will join

who will be enriched by his legacy.

HONORING RITA CANNING 

HON. RAHM EMANUEL 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor a distinguished Chicago resident, Rita 
Canning. Rita has worked tirelessly for the 
rights of women and families in Chicago. Her 
advocacy and contribution to public service 
deserve the recognition and thanks of this 
Congress. 

Rita currently serves as President of 
WINGS, Women In Need of Growing Stronger. 
This transitional shelter offers support to 
homeless and abused women and children in 
Chicago through training programs as well as 
job placement services to women in need. 
Under Rita’s leadership, WINGS helps 
marginalized women re-enter the workforce 
with greater job skills and with the resources 
necessary to achieve economic self-sufficiency. 


Rita also founded the Palatine Home of the 
Sparrow, a shelter for women and children in 
Chicago, and she is in the process of establishing 
the first domestic violence shelter in 
Chicago’s northwest suburbs. 

In addition to her work with the homeless, 
Rita does great things for education in our 
community through her work with the Canning 
Foundation. She serves as Vice-President of 
this foundation, which awards over 100 private 
school scholarships annually to inner-city children. 


Rita is also a member of the Women’s 
Board of Northwestern University, the Women’s 
Board of the Field Museum, and is a Director 
of Harris Bank. Her husband, John A. 
Canning, Jr., is the Director of the Federal Reserve 
Bank in Chicago and shares Rita’s passion 
of giving back to the community by pursuing 
several philanthropic endeavors. 

Rita’s tremendous dedication to public service 
has been recognized with various awards 
of excellence. In 2001, for example, Rita received 
the Sears Distinguished Leader Award 
for exemplary volunteer work and contributions. 
She also recently received the Illinois 
state treasurer’s ‘‘Woman to Woman Making a 
Difference Award.’’ 

Mr. Speaker, I am honored to call Rita Canning 
a good friend and to recognize her invaluable 
contributions to public service. On 
behalf of the Fifth Congressional District and 
indeed all of Chicago, I thank her for her selfless 
dedication and hard work on behalf of 
women and families in our community.

THE PRESERVING ACCESS TO 
AFFORDABLE DRUGS ACT 

HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, today I am 
proud to be introducing the Preserving Access 

to Affordable Drugs Act to preserve the drug 
benefits that millions of seniors in our country 
currently enjoy. Unfortunately, the misguided 
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and 
Modernization Act of 2003 threatens to reduce 
or eliminate the prescription drug benefits that 
millions of seniors across the country already 
have. Based on these and other detrimental 
provisions in the new law, which seniors continue 
to oppose vehemently, we should simply 
repeal the entire bill outright. But in the meantime, 
the bill I’m introducing today highlights 
the most egregious loss of benefits that seniors 
will suffer under the new law, and provides 
mechanisms to ‘‘hold harmless’’ those 
seniors who already have good drug coverage. 


The Congressional Budget Office has estimated 
that as many as 1.7 million retirees 
could lose their employer-based prescription 
drug benefits as a result of the new Medicare 
prescription drug benefit. Also as a result of 
the new law, hundreds of thousands of seniors 
currently enrolled in state pharmacy assistance 
programs (SPAPs) will be forced out of 
those programs and into a private Medicare 
drug plan. Approximately six million seniors 
who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid 
will lose access to their Medicaid prescription 
drug benefits, which is more generous 
and has greater access to a variety of 
drugs. And, despite the fact that the new 
Medicare law has huge gaps in coverage, 
seniors who choose to enroll in the new drug 
benefit will be prohibited from purchasing 
Medigap coverage to pay for prescription 
drugs not covered by the new Medicare benefit. 


In my home state of New Jersey, alone, 
94,000 retirees will lose their employer-based 
prescription drug benefits. More than 150,000 
low-income seniors in New Jersey who are 
dually eligible for, and enrolled in, both Medicare 
and Medicaid will lose access to the 
Medicaid drug benefits they currently rely on. 
And 220,000 New Jersey seniors who are currently 
enrolled in Pharmaceutical Assistance 
for the Aged and Disabled (PAAD) and Senior 
Gold, the state’s pharmacy assistance programs 
for the aged and disabled, will face disruption 
in coverage and will likely receive less 
drug coverage than they currently receive. 

It is my view—and based on what I have 
heard in town hall meetings in my district, the 
view of an overwhelming majority of seniors in 
this country—that no senior should be made 
worse of by the new Medicare law. 

The legislation I’m introducing today will: 

Preserve employer-based retiree prescription 
drug coverage by allowing employer expenditures 
on drug costs to count toward the 
out-of-pocket threshold of $3600. By not 
counting toward the catastrophic cap any 
costs covered by employer-provided retiree 
benefits, those employers that maintain their 
retiree health benefits would see their retirees 
receive less of a Medicare subsidy than a 
beneficiary without employer-provided benefits. 
Without this fix, approximately 94,000 
New Jersey seniors and 1.7 million retirees 
nationwide will likely lose their employer-based 
drug coverage. 

Enable states, if they choose, to administer 
the Medicare prescription drug benefit through 
their existing state pharmacy assistance program. 
This means that my home state of New 
Jersey could continue to provide prescription 
drug benefits to seniors through the very suc


cessful and popular existing PAAD and Senior 
Gold programs. As a result, these seniors will 
not have to enroll in the less-generous Medicare 
drug program, will be able to remain in 
PAAD and Senior Gold, and will experience 
no disruption in coverage. 

Ensure that States can provide supplemental 
Medicaid prescription drug coverage to 
complement the Medicare drug benefit to seniors 
who are dually eligible for Medicare and 
Medicaid. Currently in New Jersey, 152,000 
low-income seniors and disabled individuals 
who are Medicare eligible receive 100% of 
their drug coverage through the state Medicaid 
program. The Medicare bill replaces Medicaid 
coverage with more limited drug coverage and 
prohibits states from wrapping around the 
Medicare benefit with Medicaid coverage. This 
bill will enable states to completely wrap 
around through the Medicaid program. 

Restore Medicare beneficiaries’ ability to 
purchase supplemental drug coverage through 
the Medigap program. Under the new law, 
those who participate in the new Part D drug 
benefit are prohibited from purchasing supplemental 
drug coverage through the Medigap 
program. 

Eliminate the premium support (Medicare 
privatization) demonstration program. This is 
particularly important for Gloucester, Camden, 
Burlington and Salem counties in southern 
New Jersey, which currently meet the qualifications 
to be selected to participate in this 
program. 

Simply stated, a Medicare prescription drug 
benefit that chips away at the generous drug 
coverage that some seniors already enjoy is 
hardly a benefit at all. The new Medicare law 
is bad for seniors and should be repealed; but 
in the meantime, at the very least, we must do 
no harm. 

That’s exactly what this bill intends to do.

TRIBUTE TO A FALLEN SOLDIER 

HON. MICHAEL BILIRAKIS 

OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
pay tribute to a fallen soldier from the Ninth 
Congressional District of Florida. Lance Corporal 
James Phillips, from Plant City, Florida, 
was shot and killed as Marines were clearing 
houses in Fallujah, Iraq on December 23, 
2004. 

James’ decision to join the Marines demonstrates 
his dedication and service to this 
Nation. Following high school, our young people 
have many opportunities and wide open 
doors to pursue their dreams. James chose 
the path of the Marines because he believed 
that it was his honor and duty to serve his Nation 
and protect our freedom. He did not 
choose this path because he thought that he 
would one day become a war hero or that this 
career would provide him a lucrative and extravagant 
life. 

I know it has been a very hard and difficult 
time for James’ family and friends, especially 
to lose him so close to the Christmas holidays. 
I hope they know that the Nation thanks him 
for his service and we appreciate the sacrifices 
they had to make for us as well. 

Let freedom ring where all can hear it and 
let Lance Corporal James Phillip’s memory be 
eternal.

HONORING THE 933RD MILITARY 
POLICE COMPANY 

HON. RAHM EMANUEL 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, as this Congress 
convenes, I am proud to rise in honor of 
the brave men and women of the Illinois Army 
National Guard’s 933rd Military Police Company. 
I was honored to be invited to attend 
this unit’s holiday ball on the evening of Saturday, 
December 11, 2004, in Chicago, Illinois. 

While serving during Operation Iraqi Freedom, 
members of the 933rd MP Company 
were assigned to the 504th Military Police Battalion—
the active component based in Fort 
Lewis, Washington. The 504th MP Battalion 
was assigned to the 220th Military Police Brigade 
of the U.S. Army Reserve—the theater 
military police brigade that is assigned to the 
377th Theater Support Command, which supports 
the entire theater of operations. 

I want to thank all soldiers and the families 
of those who served in the 933rd MP Company 
for the strength and courage they have 
demonstrated since Operation Iraqi Freedom 
was launched. We are very proud of their impeccable 
service record as well as their skill, 
bravery and professionalism, each of which 
have directly resulted in saving the lives of innumerable 
U.S. soldiers, Coalition troops, and 
Iraqi civilians. The 933rd is a credit to the Military 
Police Corps. 

It is fitting that my first statement in this new 
Congress recognizes the brave men and 
women of the 933rd MP Company. Accordingly, 
we in Congress will endeavor to measure 
up to the valor of the soldiers of the 933rd, 
who make the city of Chicago and indeed the 
entire state of Illinois so very proud. We shall 
strive to make sure that maximum production 
and surplus equipment is provided to our 
troops to safeguard their lives as they carry 
out the crucial mission of maintaining the 
peace across Iraq.

INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION 
HONORING CELIA CRUZ BY 
AWARDING HER THE CONGRESSIONAL 
GOLD MEDAL 

HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ 

OF NEW JERSEY 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to offer legislation to honor my great friend, 
the music icon, Celia Cruz, who lost her courageous 
battle with cancer on July 17, 2003. 

Today, in the People’s House, I am joined 
by my colleague, Representative ILEANA ROS-
LEHTINEN, to introduce legislation that will posthumously 
award Celia Cruz the Congressional 
Gold Medal. 

Celia de la Caridad Cruz Alonso was born 
on October 21, 1924, in Havana, Cuba. Her 
career blossomed when she left Cuba for the 
United States in 1960, where she eventually 
made Fort Lee, New Jersey her home. 

Over a five-decade career as an entertainer, 
Celia Cruz became known as the ‘‘Queen of 
Salsa,’’ and claimed the calling card cry of 
‘‘Azuuuucar!’’ Celia’s passion, boundless en


ergy, and charisma transfixed generations of 
salsa fans and musicians. She recorded more 
than 70 albums and her collaborative efforts 
with other performers including the legendary 
salsa artist Tito Puente, pop star David Byrne, 
and hip-hop producer Wyclef Jean helped 
break down ethnic and cultural barriers. She 
was one of the few bridges that crossed cultural 
and racial divides. 

Celia’s musical talent earned her hundreds 
of awards worldwide, including five Grammy’s, 
two Latin Grammy’s, and the National Medal 
of Arts, the highest honor bestowed on an artist 
in the United States. She was a Hispanic 
Heritage Awards Lifetime Achievement recipient, 
and has a star on Hollywood’s Walk of 
Fame. Her music was a unifying force, and 
her passion for a free Cuba was evidenced in 
both her music and her words. 

Celia touched the lives of millions. More 
than 100,000 individuals mourned her loss at 
her wake in Miami, Florida and 75,000 people 
lined the streets of Manhattan to pay their respects 
as her funeral procession made its way 
through the streets of New York City. 

Celia Cruz made countless contributions to 
American society and the world as an entertainer, 
and she was an ambassador of Latino 
culture and a voice of freedom. Her music, her 
words, and her love of freedom live on. This 
legislation would make Celia the first Latina to 
receive the Congressional Gold Medal. 

I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I urge the leadership to bring it swiftly to the 
Floor for a vote.

PREPARING FOR THE 
PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION 

HON. JOHN B. LARSON 

OF CONNECTICUT 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I 
support passage of S. Con. Res. 2, which 
would re-establish the Joint Congressional 
Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies to continue 
preparations for the presidential inauguration 
at the U.S. Capitol on January 20, 
2005 and authorizes the use of the Capitol 
Rotunda for the proceedings. 

This non-partisan joint committee was originally 
created last year by concurrent resolution 

S. Con. Res. 94, to begin its work, but since 
resolutions do not carry over from one Congress 
to the next, it expired automatically on 
January 3, 2005, along with the 108th Congress. 
That is why this routine action is necessary 
today. 
Congress passes this concurrent resolution 
every four years. The Speaker, Majority Leader 
and Minority Leader were originally appointed 
to represent the House on the joint 
committee and will be re-appointed to continue 
in those roles. 

As for the use of the Rotunda authorized by 
Section 2 of S. Con. Res 2, we traditionally 
pass this measure at the beginning of any 
Congress following a presidential election in 
order to accommodate security planning and 
rehearsal for the inaugural, since the Rotunda 
is routinely used for ceremonial purposes during 
the inauguration and could host the event 
itself, depending on the weather at that time. 
A similar concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 

93) was also passed last year during the 
108th Congress to allow early planning for the 
inaugural to begin, but, like any resolution, it 
expired on January 3. That is why this action 
renewing the authority is necessary today. 
Therefore, I would like to urge my colleagues 
to join me in supporting this resolution so that 
we can move forward with Inaugural ceremonies.

SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR 

HEALTHY COMMUNITIES ACT OF 

2005 

HON. HILDA L. SOLIS 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to introduce 
the Safe Drinking Water for Healthy 
Communities Act of 2005. This legislation will 
require the Environmental Protection Agency 
to establish a national primary standard for 
drinking water for perchlorate, a component of 
rocket fuel used heavily by the military and its 
defense contractors. 

Communities across the country are finding 
perchlorate in their drinking water, groundwater, 
irrigation water, soil and food. Perchlorate 
has been linked to disruption of the 
thyroid, resulting in behavior changes and delayed 
development in children and thyroid tumors 
in adults. Today more than 120 wells in 
Los Angeles County have been found to be 
contaminated with varying levels of perchlorate 
and my community alone faces costs 
of at least $200 million over the next 15 years 
to manage and contain perchlorate. 

Perchlorate removes valuable water supplies 
from service and can contaminate our 
food supply. Yet there exists no enforceable 
public health standard to ensure our drinking 
water is safe and to prevent further contamination. 
At the current rate the Environmental 
Protection Agency has stated it could not 
begin to promulgate a public health standard 
for perchlorate until 2007, if it chooses to do 
so. Ultimately it is the responsibility of Congress 
to make sure that the public can trust its 
water supply, that water providers have guidance, 
and that those responsible for contamination 
know that contaminating the water supply 
and threatening public health is not acceptable. 


This bill requires the EPA to establish an 
enforceable national primary drinking water 
standard by July, 2007. Without this, there is 
no requirement for water to have safe levels of 
perchlorate and water providers will continue 
to struggle with guaranteeing long term reliability 
of safe water sources. Inaction poses 
an unreasonable risk to both our valuable 
water supply and our health.

INTRODUCTION OF THE 
DEMOCRACY DAY ACT OF 2005 

HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 

OF MICHIGAN 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to introduce the Democracy Day Act of 2005, 
legislation that would establish each Tuesday, 


E24 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks January 4, 2005 

after the first Monday in November (in even-
numbered years), as a legal public holiday. 

The Democracy Day Act of 2005 is designed 
to respond to the alarming trend of voters 
being unable to cast their vote due to work 
or other important commitments. According to 
a recent Census Bureau study, nearly 25 percent 
of eligible voters cited time constraints or 
busy work and school schedules as the primary 
reason for failing to vote in the past 
2000 presidential election. The creation of a 
federal election holiday would help address 
this problem by providing many hardworking 
Americans with the necessary time off from 
work so they can vote. Furthermore, the bill 
would have the added benefit of: Increasing 
the number of available election day judges, 
poll workers and suitable polling places; decreasing 
long lines and the overcrowding that 
occurs during peak times on election day; and 
reinforcing the notion that voting is an important 
civic duty. 

This Congress must ensure that every 
American has an equal opportunity to participate 
in the voting process. Enacting the ‘‘Democracy 
Day Act of 2005’’ would be a crucial 
first step towards achieving that objective. 

The legislation is strongly supported by a 
wide array of voting rights and labor organizations.

INTRODUCTION OF THE HEALTH 

IMPROVEMENT AND PROFES


SIONALS ACT OF 2005 

HON. TOM LANTOS 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. LANTOS. Mr. Speaker, it is well documented 
that many states, including my home 
state of California, are currently suffering from 
a nursing shortage that, if left unchecked, will 
quickly reach epidemic proportions. More than 
126,000 nursing positions in hospitals around 
the country are unfilled, according to the Joint 
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare 
Organizations. In addition, the workforce is 
shrinking, because it’s aging (and retiring) at 
twice the rate of other occupations. While the 
problem of nursing shortages will require a 
multifaceted solution, I was shocked to learn 
recently that entry into the United States by 
many qualified nurses was being delayed 
entry because of an easily correctable bureaucratic 
regulation. We cannot simply stand by 
and allow the nursing shortage to ensnarl the 
quality of American health care, and that is 
why I am introducing the Health Improvement 
and Professionals Act (HIPA) of 2005. 

Due to a change in procedures by the Citizenship 
and Immigration Services (CIS) of the 
Department of Homeland Security, the federal 
agency responsible for processing citizenship 
and immigration applications, it became necessary 
to impose a cut-off date in order to 
process a backlog of work-related immigration 
applications. As a result, CIS recently announced 
that it would no longer consider employment-
based visa applications from the 
Philippines, India or China that were filed after 
January 1, 2002. Due to the unfortunate shortage 
of American nurses, many of our nation’s 
hospitals are dependent on filling their nursing 
ranks with new workers from these countries. 
My legislation, the Health Improvement and 

Professionals Act of 2005, would provide a 
common-sense, short-term solution to the 
problems caused by the CIS policy change, 
while still allowing the agency to do the necessary 
and important work of processing its 
backlog. 

Mr. Speaker, my legislation simply allows 
CIS to recapture unused work-based immigration 
quota numbers from countries that have 
undersubscribed their own allowable visa 
numbers. By reassigning unused quota allotments 
from previous years, we would allow 
more qualified nurses to come to this country, 
bringing their crucially needed skills with them. 
Let me be clear, the HIPA Act of 2005 does 
not increase the number of immigrants allowed 
into our country. Instead, my legislation 
ensures that we are putting to full use the 
number of workers’ visas currently allowed by 
law, in order to fulfill a crucial and exponentially 
increasing worker shortage. 

The HIPA Act is modeled directly on the 
American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First 
Century Act, which Congress passed, and 
President Clinton signed into law nearly five 
years ago, in response to the shortage of 
highly skilled computer programmers and information 
technology workers needed to fuel 
the Internet boom of the late 1990’s. Like the 
HIPA Act of 2005, that law allowed for the recapture 
of unused employment-based visas to 
fill a necessary labor shortage. 

The growth of the nursing shortage is easily 
traceable—one only has to look to the fact 
that in 2002, 30 states were reportedly experiencing 
some level of nursing shortages. This 
number is expected to rise to 45 states by 
2012. The scope of this problem is compounded 
by the fact that many of today’s 
nurses are nearing retirement, and so our 
country is facing the compounded problem of 
increased retirements coupled with increased 
demand. This problem is well known to the 
federal government, as the Department of 
Labor has noted that one million new nurses 
will be needed by 2012 to meet the growing 
health needs of our country. 

Some may criticize my legislation for bringing 
nurses into the country instead of training 
American men and women to do the job. Unfortunately, 
enrollments in baccalaureate nursing 
programs at colleges and universities 
across the United States have declined for five 
consecutive years. Even in states where the 
programs are full, as in my state of California, 
nearly 70% of all nurses are trained by community 
colleges. Many of the programs at 
these schools in California are full, and some 
even have substantial waiting lists of eager 
students ready to learn about the exciting and 
rewarding profession of nursing. I will continue 
to work to expand the capacity of nurse training 
programs in our country to help relieve this 
shortage. However, the shortage in California 
is so severe that even if all of the nursing programs 
in the state were to double their enrollments, 
California would still not be able to 
meet her nursing needs in the year 2010. 

Mr. Speaker, the lack of nurses in our hospitals 
has a direct effect on the quality of the 
health care these facilities can provide. The 
shortages currently experienced in 30 states 
affects all patients, from those in operating 
rooms and intensive care units to those who 
treat children and cancer patients. In fact, according 
to a study conducted by the Harvard 
School of Health and the Henry J. Kaiser 
Family Foundation, over 50% of physicians 

surveyed believed that the nursing shortage is 
a leading cause of medical error. Additional 
studies and surveys published in the New 
England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the 
American Medical Association, and by the 
Joint Commission on Accreditation of 
Healthcare Organizations all confirm that the 
shortage of RNs is influencing the delivery of 
health care in the United States and negatively 
affecting patient outcomes. It is completely 
unacceptable in 21st century America 
that these preventable deaths are occurring. I 
hope my colleagues are as appalled about this 
as I am and that they will join me in supporting 
this common sense and critically important 
legislation. While we search for a 
longer-term solution to the problems as well 
as the causes of this nursing shortage crisis, 
the Health Improvement and Professionals Act 
of 2005 will provide a desperately needed injection 
of health care professionals into this 
country.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BRAD 
ROWSE 

HON. MIKE THOMPSON 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
Mr. HAYES, Mr. BOSWELL, Mr. KIND, Mr. PUTNAM 
and all the Members of the Congressional 
Sportsman’s Caucus received tragic news that 
Brad Rowse, Manager of Congressional 
Sportsmen’s Foundation’s (CSF) State Caucus 
program and the new National Assembly of 
Sportsmen’s Caucuses died of an aneurysm 
on Monday, December 27, 2004. He was 26 
years old. 

Brad was a dedicated and highly respected 
member of the Congressional Sportsmen’s 
Foundation joining the organization two years 
ago to help lead the early efforts to expand 
the sportsmen’s caucus model to state legislatures. 
A native of upstate New York, Brad 
grew up hunting and fishing on his family’s 
farm where he grew a passionate fondness for 
the outdoors. He used his undergraduate work 
at Cornell University and his Masters from 
SUNY Syracuse to focus on natural resource 
policy with the goal of adapting, improving and 
creating programs and policies to improve our 
fish and wildlife resources. Before coming to 
the CSF, he interned with The Wildlife Society 
and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation 
in Washington, DC. 

The unique combination of skills that Brad 
had acquired served him well during his time 
with the CSF. As the CSF State Caucus Manager, 
he built the program from its early beginnings 
to the national network of state caucuses 
that was launched on December 5, 
2004. Brad took primary responsibility for 
monitoring sportsmen’s issues at the state 
level and for building relations with state legislators 
and sportsmen’s groups to create a unified 
voice for sportsmen. Through Brad’s leadership 
and dedication there are now 21 state 
sportsmen’s caucuses and a new National Assembly 
of Sportsmen’s Caucuses to support 
their growth and success. 

America’s sportsmen and women will miss 
his leadership and commitment to protecting 
our natural resources and hunting and fishing 
heritage.

EMBRACING THE CONSTITUTION 
FLAG 

HON. ANTHONY D. WEINER 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. WEINER. Mr. Speaker, since September 
11th, 2001, this nation has engaged in 
a debate over how best to balance national 
security with civil liberties. ‘‘They who would 
give up an essential liberty for temporary security, 
deserve neither liberty or security.’’ 
Those words are as true today as they were 
when Ben Franklin said them at the dawn of 
American democracy. 

It was in that spirit that a patriotic New Yorker 
named Bob Pargament designed the ‘‘Constitution 
Flag.’’ The new symbol, an American 
Flag with the Constitution superimposed in the 
outline of the United States, reminds us never 
to undercut the freedoms guaranteed to each 
individual in the Constitution. 

While nothing can ever replace our beloved 
‘‘Old Glory,’’ this new emblem is currently flying 
in homes, city and town halls, and law 
classrooms across the country. It is on display 
at the American Library Association’s Chicago 
headquarters and the city of Mount Vernon, 
NY has officially adopted the flag as the city’s 
symbol. 

As we in Congress continue to struggle with 
ways to keep Americans safe, we should 
honor those who are working to highlight the 
civil liberties at the foundation of our democracy. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in embracing 
the Constitution Flag as an invaluable 
reminder of what keeps American strong.

FORMER MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT 
ENDORSES FREEDOM 
FOR KHALISTAN—SOVEREIGNTY 
WILL END OPPRESSION 

HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, on December 8, 
the Tribune newspaper out of Chandigarh, 
Punjab reported that a former Member of Parliament, 
Simranjit Singh Mann, had endorsed 
sovereignty for the Sikh homeland, Khalistan. 
His endorsement is part of a rising tide that includes 
the Punjab government declaring its 
sovereignty when it ended its water agreements 
with the other states in India. 

I note that Mr. Mann said that the Sikhs are 
a separate nation and promised to lead a 
movement to liberate Khalistan. I hope that he 
keeps his promise. My friend Dr. Gurmit Singh 
Aulakh, President of the Council of Khalistan 
and an invaluable resource for information 
about South Asian affairs, has been saying 
the same things for several years. It seems 
that India’s oppression that killed a quarter of 
a million Sikhs and keeps more than 52,000 of 
them as political prisoners has failed to 
dampen the desire and enthusiasm of the 
Sikhs for their own sovereign, independent 
country. I salute Mr. Mann’s position. It is important 
for leaders in Punjab to speak out 
strongly for Khalistan. We can help from here, 
but the effort must be won in Punjab, 
Khalistan itself. 

Mr. Speaker, all peoples are entitled to live 
in freedom. The Sikhs of Punjab, Khalistan 
made their choice on October 7, 1987 when 
they declared their independence from India, 
calling their new country Khalistan. India, 
which proudly claims to be democratic, refuses 
even to hold a free and fair vote on the 
question, just as India has never kept its 
promise of 1948 to hold a plebiscite on the future 
of Kashmir. How can a country do these 
things and claim to be democratic? Self-determination 
is the essence of democracy. 

A new Congress gives us a new opportunity 
to take a stand for freedom in South Asia and 
around the world. We should stop all U.S. aid 
to India until it allows full democratic rights 
and full human rights to all people living within 
its borders and we should strongly support a 
free and fair plebiscite in Punjab, Khalistan, in 
Nagaland, in Kashmir, and wherever people 
seek their freedom on the question of independence. 
By promoting such a plebiscite, we 
promote democracy and human rights for all 
people in that troubled region. 

Mr. Speaker, I would like to insert the Council 
of Khalistan’s press release on Mr. Mann’s 
remarks into the RECORD at this time. 

MANN REVERTS TO SUPPORTING KHALISTAN 

WASHINGTON, DC, DECEMBER 10, 2004—Once 
again, former MP Simranjit Singh Mann, 
leader of the Shiromani Alkali Dal (Amritsar), 
has staked out a position in support of 
a sovereign, independent Khalistan. Speaking 
in Ludhiana on December 7 at a meeting 
of his party, Mann said that the SAD (Amritsar) 
would launch a peaceful movement to 
achieve a separate and sovereign Sikh state, 
according to the December 8 issue of The 
Tribune (Chandigarh.) Mann claimed that his 
party had never given up this position. 

Mann reminded his party that Sikhs are a 
separate nationality. He said that the foundation 
for an independent Khalistan was laid 
by Guru Gobind Singh and furthered by Sant 
Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and that this 
dream ‘‘will be materialized one day.’’ Guru 
Gobind Singh gave sovereignty to the Sikh 
Nation (‘‘In grieb Sikhin ko deon patshahi.’’) 
Sikhs are a separate nation. Sikhs ruled 
Punjab up to 1849 when the British conquered 
the subcontinent. Mann noted that it is in 
the interests of all the people in the region 
to have a buffer state between India and 
Pakistan to help ensure lasting peace in 
South Asia, given the deep hostility between 
‘‘Hindu civilization and Muslim civilization.’’ 


Mann’s remarks show that the desire for 
Khalistan remains strong in the Sikhs of 
Punjab, said Dr. Gurmit Singh Aulakh, 
President of the Council of Khalistan, which 
leads the Sikh struggle for independence. Dr. 
Aulakh also cited the actions taken by Chief 
Minister Amarinder Singh, such as declaring 
Punjab’s sovereignty in stopping all water 
agreements between Punjab and other 
states, as moving toward this goal. On October 
7, 1987, the Sikh Nation declared its independence 
from India, naming its new country 
Khalistan. The Council of Khalistan was established 
at that time to lead the peaceful, 
democratic, nonviolent movement to liberate 
Khalistan from Indian oppression. 

History shows that multinational states 
such as India are doomed to failure. Countries 
like Austria-Hungary, India’s longtime 
friend the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, 
and others prove this point. India 
is not one country; it is a polyglot like those 
countries, thrown together for the convenience 
of the British colonialists. It is doomed 
to break up as they did. Recently, the Punjab 
Legislative Assembly passed a bill annulling 
all water agreements with the Indian 

government, preventing the government’s 
daylight robbery of Punjab river water. Punjab 
needs its river water for its crops. In the 
bill, the Assembly explicitly stated the sovereignty 
of Punjab. 

The Indian government has murdered over 
250,000 Sikhs since 1984, more than 300,000 
Christians since 1948, over 89,000 Muslims in 
Kashmir since 1988, and tens of thousands of 
Tamils, Assamese, Manipuris, Dalits, and 
others. The Indian Supreme Court called the 
Indian government’s murders of Sikhs 
‘‘worse than a genocide.’’ 

Indian police arrested human-rights activist 
Jaswant Singh Khalra after he exposed 
their policy of mass cremation of Sikhs, in 
which over 50,000 Sikhs have been arrested, 
tortured, and murdered, then their bodies 
were declared unidentified and secretly cremated. 
He was murdered in police custody. 
His body was not given to his family. 

The police never released the body of 
former Jathedar of the Akal Takht Gurdev 
Singh Kaunke after SSP Swaran Singh 
Ghotna murdered him. Ghotna has never 
been brought to trial for the Jathedar 
Kaunke murder. No one has been brought to 
justice for the kidnapping and murder of 
Jaswant Singh Khalra. 

According to a report by the Movement 
Against State Repression (MASR), 52,268 
Slikhs are being held as political prisoners 
in India without charge or trial. Some have 
been in illegal custody since 1984! Tens of 
thousands of other minorities are also being 
held as political prisoners, according to Amnesty 
International. We demand the immediate 
release of all these political prisoners. 

‘‘It is encouraging that Mr. Mann has 
comeback to demanding Khalistan,’’ said Dr. 
Gurmit Singh Aulakh, President of the 
Council of Khalistan. ‘‘This is another step 
forward for the movement to liberate our 
homeland from Indian oppression.’’ 

‘‘As Professor Darshan Singh, a former 
Jathedar of the Akal Takht, said, ‘If a Sikh 
is not for Khalistan, he is not a Sikh’,’’ Dr. 
Aulakh noted. ‘‘We must continue to press 
for our God-given birthright of freedom,’’ he 
said. ‘‘Without political power, religions cannot 
flourish and nations perish. A sovereign 
Khalistan is essential for the survival of the 
Sikh religion.’’

INTRODUCTION OF THE H.R. 28, 
THE HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING 
REVITALIZATION ACT 
OF 2005 

HON. JUDY BIGGERT 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mrs. BIGGERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
introduce the High-Performance Computing— 
or HPC—Revitalization Act of 2005, which will 
ensure that America remains a leader in the 
development and use of supercomputers. 

When we think of how computers affect our 
lives, we probably think of the work we do on 
our office desktop machines, or maybe the 
Internet surfing we do in our spare time. We 
don’t normally think of the enormous contribution 
that supercomputers—also called high 
performance computers—make to the world 
around us. 

These powerful machines are used in the 
development of pharmaceuticals, in modeling 
the earth’s climate, in applications critical to 
ensuring our national and homeland security, 
and to strengthen our economic competitiveness. 
High-performance computers also are 
central to maintaining U.S. leadership in many 
scientific fields. Computational science complements 
theory and experimentation in fields 
such as plasma physics and fusion, astrophysics, 
nuclear physics, and genomics. 

Mr. Speaker, dramatic scientific and commercial 
breakthroughs will require increasing 
computing power by a factor of a hundred, or 
in some cases, by a factor of a thousand. 
While attaining these increases may seem 
daunting, the history of computer development 
has taught us that with a sustained commitment 
to research, such gains are within our 
reach. 

For nearly three years, Japan was home to 
the world’s fastest supercomputer, the Earth 
Simulator. But during those years, the United 
States remained a leader in high performance 
computing as home to many of the world’s 
fastest supercomputers. For example, a list of 
the world’s fastest computers released last 
spring documented that 10 of the top 20 
supercomputers were in the United States at 
that time. 

Then, just two months ago, the United 
States regained the lead when IBM’s Blue 
Gene/L supercomputer was recognized as the 
fastest computer in the world. IBM and the 

U.S. supercomputing industry are to be commended 
for their impressive accomplishments. 
These are accomplishments upon which we 
must build if the United States is to retain its 
leading role in the development and use of 
supercomputers. 

That’s why my legislation updates an important 
law not revised since it passed in 1991. 
The HPC Revitalization Act of 2005 clarifies 
the federal government’s role in supporting 
supercomputing research and development in 
the United States. More specifically, my bill 
does four things: 

First, it requires that federal agencies provide 
the U.S. research community access to 
the most advanced high-performance computing 
systems, and technical support for their 
users. 

Second, there’s more to supercomputing 
than building big machines. That’s why the bill 
requires federal agencies to support all as


pects of high-performance computing for scientific 
and engineering applications, including: 
Software, algorithm and applications development; 
Development of technical standards; 
and Education and training. 

Third, the bill requires the White House Office 
of Science and Technology Policy to direct 
an interagency planning process to develop 
and maintain a research, development, 
and deployment roadmap for the provision of 
high-performance computing resources for the 

U.S. research community. This provision will 
help ensure an ongoing, robust planning process 
for our national high-performance computing 
efforts. 
Finally, the bill clarifies the missions of each 
of the federal agencies that have a role in developing 
or using High Performance Computing. 


Mr. Speaker, at a full committee hearing on 
May 13 of last year, Dr. John Marburger, Director 
of the White House Office of Science 
and Technology Policy, communicated the Administration’s 
support for this bill. 

Dr. Marburger and the Bush Administration 
recognize that we can’t have world-class 
science if we don’t have world-class computers. 
We cannot imagine the kinds of problems 
that the supercomputers of tomorrow will 
be able to solve. But we can imagine the kind 
of problems we will have if we fail to provide 
researchers in the United States with the computing 
resources they need to remain world-
class. 

That’s why the House passed this same bill 
in the 109th Congress. It will guide federal 
agencies in providing needed support to high-
performance computing and its user communities. 
Our nation’s scientific enterprise, and 
our economy, will be the stronger for it. 

To conclude, I want to recognize the bill’s 
cosponsors, Chairman SHERWOOD BOEHLERT 
and Congressman LINCOLN DAVIS, and thank 
them for their support. I hope the rest of my 
colleagues will again support this legislation 
when it comes to the floor for consideration in 
the 109th Congress. With your help, we will 
ensure that the United States maintains its 
distinction as home to the world’s most powerful 
computer.

THE LIFE OF FATHER MAC 

HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 

OF ILLINOIS 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and reflect the life of Monsignor 
Ignatius McDermott, who many called 
Father Mac, a Chicago Priest who helped 
thousands of people with drug and alcohol 
abuse. 

Father Mac was born on Chicago’s South 
Side in 1909 to an Irish Catholic family. He attended 
St. Gabriel Catholic School and then 
graduated from the former Visitation Catholic 
School. He was ordained in 1936 after studying 
at Quigley Preparatory Seminary and 
Mundelein’s St. Mary of the Lake Seminary. 

During his leave from the seminary in 1930, 
Father Mac traveled daily through ‘‘Skid Row’’ 
to get to his job at Arlington Park racetrack. 
From his daily encounters of seeing the despair 
of alcohol and substance abuse, he 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E27 

began ministering to the homeless and alcoholics—
the forgotten populations. Working toward 
a solution, Father Mac founded the Addiction 
Counseling Education Services in 
1961, which provided counseling to alcoholics 
and other substance abusers who had no 
other means to get help. He would later expand 
his work to the Chicago schools system, 
where he developed an alcohol education curriculum 
and fostered Alternatives to Expulsion, 
a program to help teachers salvage addicted 
teenagers who were willing to give up drinking 
and drugs and resume their studies. 

After serving as a parish priest and Chicago 
Archdiocese administrator, Father Mac devoted 
full time to helping those who could not 
help themselves and co-founded Haymarket 
Center. This Center is the largest drug abuse 
treatment center in Chicago serving an average 
of 18,000 clients annually. Haymarket 
truly changes individuals’ lives with providing 
integrated treatment services, job training and 
serves as one of the few facilities that assist 
addicted mothers through pregnancy seeing 
the delivery of over 900 drug free babies. 
Haymarket Center serves as a model for other 
treatment programs throughout the Nation. 

Ironically, on New Years Eve, as Haymarket 
Center celebrated its 29th year, Father Mac 
passed at the age of 95. Sadly, we lose a 
man of unwavering faith, deep compassion, 
and tireless devotion to helping those who are 
among the most desperate and needy. 

The Chicago Sun-Times call him Chicago’s 
Living Saint. Others call him the patron saint 
of the addicted. It is hard to find words to describe 
the care, love and compassion Father 
Mac had for all people—especially those that 
everyone else forgot about. 

Last Congress, I introduced a resolution 
with my colleagues from Illinois, Speaker 
HASTERT, Congressman LAHOOD, and the 
former-Congressman Lipinski to honor Father 
Mac with the Congressional Gold Medal. I 
would like to thank my 114 colleagues who 
cosponsored this legislation. In memory of Father 
Mac, one of his favorite quotes read: 
‘‘When you no longer burn with love, others 
will die of the cold.’’ St. Vincent DePaul,

INTRODUCTION OF THE FAIRNESS 

TO ALL VIETNAM VETERANS ACT 

HON. JUANITA MILLENDER-McDONALD 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Ms. MILLENDER-MCDONALD. Mr. Speaker, 
I want to bring to the attention of this Congress, 
legislation that I am reintroducing today. 

The Fairness to All Vietnam Veterans Act 
directs the Secretary of Defense to find an appropriate 
way to recognize and honor Vietnam 
Veterans who died in service to our nation but 
whose names are not listed on the wall of the 
Vietnam Veterans Memorial. 

A family in my district, Mary and Tom 
Manley of Long Beach California, brought the 
need for this legislation to my attention. 

Tom Manley is a survivor of the U.S.S. 
Frank E. Evans. 

The Evans sailed from the Port of Long 
Beach for the last time in the spring of 1969. 

After seeing serious combat off the coast of 
Vietnam, the U.S.S. Evans was sent to a brief 
training exercise called ‘‘Operation Sea Spirit.’’ 
This training exercise involved ships of the 
Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. 

In the early morning hours of June 3, 1969, 
the crew of the U.S.S. Frank E. Evans awoke 
to the sounds of an Australian carrier splitting 
their vessel in half. The forward half, where all 
74 deaths took place, sank in three minutes. 
There were 198 survivors. 

Although the Evans was in the South China 
Sea, these sailors’ names are not listed on the 
Vietnam Memorial wall because the U.S.S 
Evans was just outside the designated combat 
zone, which determines inclusion on the wall. 

Unfortunately, the case of the U.S.S. Frank 

E. Evans does not stand-alone. 
There are many families across the United 
States, like the Manleys in Long Beach, who 
have loved ones and friends that have been 
excluded from proper recognition—maybe 
even in your district. 

It is time for the Department of Defense to 
examine current policies for placement on the 
Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. 

This legislation also calls on the organizations 
and government agencies that originally 
constructed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to 
examine the feasibility of inscribing additional 
names. 

Should there be no practical way to add 
these names, the bill seeks appropriate alternatives 
for recognizing these veterans. 

I ask Members to join me in properly honoring 
those Veterans who have given their 
lives for their country. 

With the ongoing conflict in Iraq we are all 
acutely aware of the sacrifices our men and 
women in the military have recently made to 
ensure our nation’s safety, security and our 
freedom. 

A Nation is judged on how well they treat 
their Veterans. Let us not forget those of a 
past generation who fought for the freedom 
that we all cherish today. 

Join me and support The Fairness to All 
Vietnam Veterans Act.

INTRODUCTION OF THE SECURE 

DOMESTIC CONTAINER PARTNER


SHIP ACT OF 2005 

HON. JUANITA MILLENDER-McDONALD 

OF CALIFORNIA 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Ms. MILLENDER-MCDONALD. Mr. Speaker, 
I want to bring to the attention of this Congress, 
legislation that I have introduced 
today—The Secure Domestic Container Partnership 
Act of 2005. 

This legislation directs the Secretary of 
Homeland Security to create a pilot program 
that encourages shipping handlers to seal 
empty shipping containers after they have unpacked 
them. 

Under this pilot program, the Secretary may 
authorize a shipper, cargo carrier, freight forwarder, 
terminal operator, port authority, or 
labor organization that is a qualified container 
handler to secure under a seal approved by 
the Secretary, a shipping container that is 
emptied by the person. 

It is my strong belief that this program, 
when fully implemented, will do so much for 
securing our supply chain, reducing congestion 
around our ports and intermodal centers 
while offering our shippers the opportunity to 
actively participate in securing our home front, 
our economic supply chain, our transportation 
infrastructure and most importantly our communities. 


Last year, in response to the 9/11 Commission 
Report the Maritime and Coast Guard 
subcommittee took testimony from panelists 
responding to the Commission’s findings and 
directives. 

A scenario, presented to our Committee that 
characterized ‘‘cargo containers as a poor 
man’s missile,’’ struck me as all too real. In 
Southern California, the ports of Long Beach 
and Los Angeles imported 68,000 containers a 
week in 2003. Combine exports and imports 
for 2003 and you have 125,000 containers 
that come in, out and through the most populous 
region in the country with seventeen million 
residents and growing—and with many 
high risk targets. Our streets, our communities, 
our rail infrastructure at any time are 
supporting full and empty containers. 

Containers are as common in Southern 
California as lawyers are in Washington, DC. 
Look around you and you will know what I 
mean. 

Now, if a container were to be compromised, 
empty or full, it would call into question 
the integrity of all containers on our highways 
and railways that travel along our entire 
transportation infrastructure and throughout 
our communities. 

Placing a seal on an empty container is a 
cost effective common sense solution that further 
strengthens the partnership between the 
shipping community and the Department of 
Homeland Security against the ongoing war 
on terrorism. 

Specifically, I would recommend that the 
Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism 
or C–TPAT administer this program. 

This initiative, under the Customs and Border 
Protection Directorate at the Department 
of Homeland Security, has a proven track 
record of doing great things with securing our 
supply line. 

Through the C–TPAT initiative, Customs 
has been working in partnership with companies 
and carriers involved in importing goods 
into the United States. 

Companies are asked to assess the 
vulnerabilities of their supply chains and to 
work with Customs to address any vulnerability. 


In short, the C–TPAT initiative is the equivalent 
to the trusted traveler program for goods 
that the FAA is currently implementing for passengers. 


The C–TPAT initiative would be an excellent 
partner and I would encourage the Secretary 
to take my recommendation. 

Like the C–TPAT initiative, the pilot program 
created by enactment of The Secure Domestic 
Container Partnership Act of 2005 would be 
purely voluntary on the part of shippers. 

This is a win/win for businesses, our transportation 
system and our communities. 

I ask my colleagues to strongly support the 
‘‘The Secure Domestic Container Partnership 
Act of 2005.’’

MOURNING THE LOSS OF SHIRLEY 

CHISHOLM 

HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, it is with great 
sadness that I rise to mourn the passing of my 
predecessor and mentor, former Congresswoman 
Shirley Chisholm. 

As the first African-American woman elected 
to Congress and the first African-American to 
seriously run for the office of the Presidency, 
Shirley was a trailblazer who opened the 
doors of opportunity for generations of women 
and minority politicians. 

Her advocacy for the education of the disadvantaged, 
Title IX, and early childhood education 
established her as one of the foremost 
education policymakers during her seven 
terms in Congress. But her legacy did not end 
there. Unmatched as a voice for social justice, 
Shirley fought for the interests of groups like 
veterans, Haitian refugees and day workers. 

A gifted orator, Shirley’s ‘‘unbought and 
unbossed’’ political style allowed her to make 
friends and political alliances on both sides of 
the aisle. She was truly one in a million and 
I am honored to have been part of her Brooklyn 
political circle and to have worked along 
side her throughout her political career. Anyone 
who came in contact with Shirley Chisholm 
was forever changed for the better; she 
is one soul on this earth who is truly irreplaceable 
and she will be sorely missed by all of 
those who knew and loved her.

REMEMBERING SHIRLEY 
CHISHOLM 

HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, today I’m filled 
with great sadness that on the eve of the 
109th Congress we mourn the passing of my 
longtime friend and colleague, Shirley Chisholm, 
the first African-American woman elected 
to Congress and the first of her race to 
seek a major party nomination for the Presidency. 
She died at her Ormond Beach, FL 
home on New Year’s Day at the age of 80. 

I commend to my colleagues the following 
article describing a time in the life of Shirley 
Chisholm written by Wil Haygood in the Washington 
Post on January 4, 2005. 

[From the Washington Post, Jan. 4, 2005] 

A WOMAN OF THE PEOPLE 

SHIRLEY CHISHOLM TOOK A BACK SEAT TO NO 

ONE 

(By Wil Haygood) 
There was something so plain and yet so 
defiant about her. Studious and yet a little 
jazzy, especially in front of those Brooklyn 
church ladies. 
Shirley Chisholm, the former congresswoman 
who died New Year’s Day in Florida 
at age 80, came along at a moment in the 
1960s when there was a bubbling symmetry 
between the women’s liberation movement 
and the civil rights movement. She was holding 
two candles in the wind. 
At church podiums in Brooklyn, she’d talk 
about babies eating paint they had peeled 

from the walls, and she’d talk about malnourished 
schoolchildren, and she’d raise her 
fist, and her big mound of cloudlike hair 
would bob, and she would start to crying, 
tears rolling from beneath those beatnik-era 
glasses. She would turn her back to the audience—
as if she couldn’t stand her own 
tears—and then turn around to face the folk 
in the pews, and they’d be stomping. 

‘‘I used to say to her, ‘You should go into 
drama,’ ‘‘recalls Edolphus Towns, a Democratic 
congressman from Brooklyn. ‘‘She 
could drop tears at any time.’’ 

Chisholm began her working life in 1950s 
Brooklyn. She was the director of a day-care 
center and worked as an educational consultant 
for the city. The tots had parents and 
she befriended them and got herself elected 
to the New York State Assembly in 1964. She 
was headed to Albany, the same place that 
launched the national political careers of 
Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Dewey, Franklin 
D. Roosevelt and many others. 

In the ’60s, the talk in New York of black 
political figures focused on names such as 
Basil Patterson, Percy Sutton, Charlie Ran-
gel. They were young lions who belonged to 
Harlem political clubs. (There was also 
Adam Clayton Powell, the once-powerful 
congressman who had crawled back to Congress 
in 1969 after an expulsion and scandalous 
headlines. But his day was now gone.) 

But Patterson and Sutton and Rangel suddenly 
had to yank their heads and look 
across the bridge, to Brooklyn. 

Shirley who? 

‘‘Shirley came out of Brooklyn, and that 
was one of the roughest political arenas you 
can come out of—even today,’’ says Rep. 
Rangel (D), who knew Chisholm for decades. 
‘‘For her to succeed, she had to be a little 
strange—and certainly extraordinary.’’ 

In addition to being a woman and from 
Brooklyn, Chisholm was also—unlike Powell, 
Sutton, Rangel and Patterson—dark-
skinned. Given the history of skin color, she 
had an extra ladder to climb, and did so with 
relish, carrying herself with the insouciance 
of the world’s most attractive woman. 

So there she’d be, needing a ride to Albany 
and getting herself over to Harlem so that 
Sutton, who was also in the assembly, could 
pick her up. 

‘‘Shirley would meet us on the corner of 
125th and Seventh—now Adam Clayton Powell 
Boulevard—and ride with us to Albany,’’ 
says Sutton. ‘‘We did that for two years.’’ 

Sutton noted something about Chisholm 
on those rides. She was hungry for debate: 
‘‘Even if she agreed with you, she’d want to 
debate you!’’ 

With the ’60s drawing to a close, Chisholm 
was swimming in the waters of history. ‘‘She 
had the imagination,’’ says Rangel, ‘‘of being 
first—and tenacious.’’ 

So she announced in 1968 that she was running 
for Congress. There were howls of 
laughter, though not from the church ladies, 
who saw themselves in the reflection of her 
beatnik eyeglasses. 

In 1968, she became the first black woman 
elected to Congress. She grinned and gave 
the peace sign. It wasn’t black power. It was 
Shirley power. She wound up serving seven 
terms. 

She pushed for antipoverty legislation and 
became a star. Ebony magazine wanted her, 
and so did Ms. magazine. She appeared with 
Reps. Barbara Jordan and Bella Abzug. She 
was known as honest and honorable. ‘‘Chisholm 
would not set up any kind of a side deal 
for her mother, brother, or cousin,’’ says 
William Howard, who served as her financial 
adviser. 

When Chisholm announced a run for the 
presidency in 1972, it seemed a little strange. 
She was the first black to conduct a large-
scale presidential campaign within one of 

the major parties. The Congressional Black 
Caucus hardly had the numbers then that it 
has now, but she rolled her eyes when its 
members asked why she hadn’t discussed her 
presidential plans with them. ‘‘Shirley had a 
lot of self-confidence,’’ says Rangel. 

‘‘I Am Woman’’ by Helen Reddy was humming 
on the jukebox that year. 

‘‘Black people needed somebody,’’ says 
Sutton. ‘‘We had lost Martin and Malcolm.’’ 
He raised the first $25,000 for her presidential 
campaign. 

At the Democratic National Convention in 
Miami Beach, she was smiling from the podium—
those glasses, that hair, the dark 
skin. Simply getting there was a huge victory. 


‘‘The next time a woman runs,’’ she wrote 
in her 1973 autobiography, ‘‘The Good 
Fight,’’ ‘‘or a black, a Jew or anyone from a 
group that the country is ‘not ready’ to elect 
to its highest office, I believe he or she will 
be taken seriously from the start. The door 
is not open yet, but it is ajar.’’ 

And, in time, they came: Geraldine Ferraro, 
Jesse Jackson, Joseph Lieberman. 

The last time William Howard saw Chisholm 
was a year and a half ago in Manhattan. 
She had wanted to go dancing. She was 
peering at him, through those beatnik glasses, 
out on the dance floor, imploring him to 
tell the band to play something jazzy.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 

FORMER REPRESENTATIVE 

SHIRLEY CHISHOLM 

HON. LOUISE McINTOSH SLAUGHTER 

OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to honor the memory of former Congresswoman 
Shirley Chisholm, who was a national 
role model. 

I followed in the footsteps of Rep. Chisholm 
in several respects, having served both in the 
New York State Assembly and in the House of 
Representatives. To my knowledge, we are 
the only two Democratic women from New 
York State to have that distinction. 

Shirley Chisholm was a tireless advocate for 
social justice, and for that legacy our country 
will be eternally grateful. 

As the first black woman to be elected to 
the U.S. Congress and to run for president of 
the United States, Shirley Chisholm threw 
open the doors to greater opportunities for 
women and minorities. 

Along with Congresswoman Bella Abzug, 
Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan—also great 
women’s rights leaders—Shirley Chisholm 
founded the National Women’s Political Caucus 
in 1971. She also helped found the Congressional 
Black Caucus. Both of these organizations 
have served an important role in increasing 
representation of women and minorities 
in Congress. 

I think it is important to note her life-long 
passion for improving educational opportunities 
for our Nation’s youth, carrying on this tradition 
after her years in Congress by serving 
as the Purington Professor at Mount Holyoke 
College. 

She also promoted increased assistance for 
urban areas, land rights for Native Americans, 
fair treatment of Haitian refugees, and more 
help for working-class families trying to make 
ends meet. 

I join together with our Nation in honoring 
her life’s work. Along with my colleagues, I cosponsored 
a Congressional resolution today 


January 4, 2005 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E29 

that would honor her life. This resolution will 
help ensure that her legacy and the positive 
momentum that she initiated through her work 
would continue, and I urge the House to bring 
this resolution up for a vote without delay.

HONORING REPRESENTATIVE 
SHIRLEY CHISHOLM 

HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 

OF NEW YORK 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Tuesday, January 4, 2005 

Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay 
honor to Representative Shirley Chisholm, the 
first black woman elected to Congress and a 
candidate for the presidency in 1972, and who 
passed away on Saturday in Florida at the 
age of 80. Representative Chisholm was elected 
to Congress in 1968 and served until 1982. 
During her seven terms, she was an outspoken 
advocate for women and minorities 
and a riveting speaker who often called on 
Congress to be more responsive to the public. 

During her first term in Congress, Representative 
Chisholm hired an all-female staff 

and spoke out for civil rights, women’s rights, 
the poor, and against the Vietnam War. 
Throughout her tenure, she was a sought-after 
public speaker. Representative Chisholm was 
a cofounder of the National Organization for 
Women, the Congressional Black Caucus, and 
the National Women’s Political Caucus. She 
was also the first black person to conduct a 
large-scale campaign for the presidency within 
the two-party system. As a candidate for the 
Democratic nomination in 1972, Representative 
Chisholm won 152 delegates before withdrawing 
from the race. When her ideological 
opposite, George Wallace, was shot, she surprised 
many by visiting him in the hospital. 

Representative Chisholm was born Shirley 
Hill in New York on November 20, 1924, the 
oldest of four daughters of a Guyanese father 
and a Barbadian mother, who scrimped to 
educate their children. Representative Chisholm 
lived on her maternal grandmother’s 
farm in Barbados from age 3 to age 11, where 
she attended a British grammar school and 
picked up the clipped Caribbean accent that 
marked her speech. She went on to graduate 
cum laude from Brooklyn College and earn a 
master’s degree from Columbia University. 
She began her career as the director of a day 

care center, then moved on to be an educational 
consultant for the New York City Bureau 
of Child Welfare. A long-time political activist, 
she became involved in Democratic politics 
and was elected to the New York State 
Assembly in 1964. During her tenure in the 
legislature, she proposed a bill to provide 
State aid to day-care centers and voted to increase 
funding for schools on a per-pupil 
basis. 

After leaving Congress, Representative 
Chisholm was named to the Purington Chair 
at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, 
Massachusetts and also served as a visiting 
scholar at Spelman College. She received 
many honorary degrees, and her awards include 
Alumna of the Year, Brooklyn College; 
Key Woman of the Year; Outstanding Work in 
the Field of Child Welfare; and Woman of 
Achievement. She is the author of two autobiographical 
works, Unbought and Unbossed 
(1970) and The Good Fight (1973). Representative 
Chisholm was a pioneer in her 
time and her life should serve as an example 
of what can be accomplished if we have the 
courage and the strength to stand and fight for 
what we believe in. Her wit, wisdom, and leadership 
will be sorely missed.

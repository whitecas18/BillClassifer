(vii)Use of website to determine final conditional reimbursement amount
(I)Notice to Secretary of expected date of a settlement, judgment, etc
In the case of a payment made by the Secretary pursuant to clause (i) for items and services provided to the claimant, the claimant or applicable plan (as defined in paragraph (8)(F)) may at any time beginning 120 days before the reasonably expected date of a settlement, judgment, award, or other payment, notify the Secretary that a payment is reasonably expected and the expected date of such payment.

(II)Secretarial providing access to claims information through a website
The Secretary shall maintain and make available to individuals to whom items and services are furnished under this title (and to authorized family or other representatives recognized under regulations and to an applicable plan which has obtained the consent of the individual) access to information on the claims for such items and services (including payment amounts for such claims), including those claims that relate to a potential settlement, judgment, award, or other payment. Such access shall be provided to an individual, representative, or plan through a website that requires a password to gain access to the information. The Secretary shall update the information on claims and payments on such website in as timely a manner as possible but not later than 15 days after the date that payment is made. Information related to claims and payments subject to the notice under subclause (I) shall be maintained and made available consistent with the following:

(aa)The information shall be as complete as possible and shall include provider or supplier name, diagnosis codes (if any), dates of service, and conditional payment amounts.
(bb)The information accurately identifies those claims and payments that are related to a potential settlement, judgment, award, or other payment to which the provisions of this subsection apply.
(cc)The website provides a method for the receipt of secure electronic communications with the individual, representative, or plan involved.
(dd)The website provides that information is transmitted from the website in a form that includes an official time and date that the information is transmitted.
(ee)The website shall permit the individual, representative, or plan to download a statement of reimbursement amounts (in this clause referred to as a statement of reimbursement amount) on payments for claims under this title relating to a potential settlement, judgment, award, or other payment.
(III)Use of timely web download as basis for final conditional amount
If an individual (or other claimant or applicable plan with the consent of the individual) obtains a statement of reimbursement amount from the website during the protected period as defined in subclause (V) and the related settlement, judgment, award or other payment is made during such period, then the last statement of reimbursement amount that is downloaded during such period and within 3 business days before the date of the settlement, judgment, award, or other payment shall constitute the final conditional amount subject to recovery under clause (ii) related to such settlement, judgment, award, or other payment.

(IV)Resolution of discrepancies
If the individual (or authorized representative) believes there is a discrepancy with the statement of reimbursement amount, the Secretary shall provide a timely process to resolve the discrepancy. Under such process the individual (or representative) must provide documentation explaining the discrepancy and a proposal to resolve such discrepancy. Within 11 business days after the date of receipt of such documentation, the Secretary shall determine whether there is a reasonable basis to include or remove claims on the statement of reimbursement. If the Secretary does not make such determination within the 11 business-day period, then the proposal to resolve the discrepancy shall be accepted. If the Secretary determines within such period that there is not a reasonable basis to include or remove claims on the statement of reimbursement, the proposal shall be rejected. If the Secretary determines within such period that there is a reasonable basis to conclude there is a discrepancy, the Secretary must respond in a timely manner by agreeing to the proposal to resolve the discrepancy or by providing documentation showing with good cause why the Secretary is not agreeing to such proposal and establishing an alternate discrepancy resolution. In no case shall the process under this subclause be treated as an appeals process or as establishing a right of appeal for a statement of reimbursement amount and there shall be no administrative or judicial review of the Secretaryâ€™s determinations under this subclause.

(V)Protected period
In subclause (III), the term protected period means, with respect to a settlement, judgment, award or other payment relating to an injury or incident, the portion (if any) of the period beginning on the date of notice under subclause (I) with respect to such settlement, judgment, award, or other payment that is after the end of a Secretarial response period beginning on the date of such notice to the Secretary. Such Secretarial response period shall be a period of 65 days, except that such period may be extended by the Secretary for a period of an additional 30 days if the Secretary determines that additional time is required to address claims for which payment has been made. Such Secretarial response period shall be extended and shall not include any days for any part of which the Secretary determines (in accordance with regulations) that there was a failure in the claims and payment posting system and the failure was justified due to exceptional circumstances (as defined in such regulations). Such regulations shall define exceptional circumstances in a manner so that not more than 1 percent of the repayment obligations under this subclause would qualify as exceptional circumstances.

(VI)Effective date
The Secretary shall promulgate final regulations to carry out this clause not later than 9 months after the date of the enactment of this clause.

(VII)Website including successor technology
In this clause, the term website includes any successor technology.

                issuer is required to use to determine the median in-
                network rate described in paragraph (1), the 
                information the plan or issuer shall share with the 
                out-of-network provider involved when making such a 
                determination, and the geographic regions applied for 
                purposes of this subsection. Such rulemaking shall take 
                into account payments that are made by issuers that are 
                not on a fee-for-service basis.
                    ``(B) Geographic regions.--In establishing 
                geographic regions as described in subparagraph (A), 
                the Secretary shall consider adequate access to 
                services in rural areas. The Secretary shall consult 
                with the National Association of Insurance 
                Commissioners in establishing the geographic regions. 
                The Secretary shall update the geographic regions 
                periodically, as appropriate, taking into account the 
                findings of the report under section 106 of the Lower 
                Health Care Costs Act.
            ``(3) Certain insurers.--If a group health plan or health 
        insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance 
        coverage does not have sufficient information to calculate a 
        median in-network rate for this service or provider type, or 
        amount of, claims for services (as determined by the applicable 
        State authority, in the case of health insurance coverage, or 
        by the Secretary of Labor, in the case of a self-insured group 
        health plan) covered under the list of out-of-network services 
        set by the State authority or Secretary of Labor, as 
        applicable, in a particular geographic area, such plan or 
        issuer shall demonstrate that it will use a database free of 
        conflicts of interest that has sufficient information 
        reflecting allowed amounts paid to individual health care 
        providers for relevant services provided in the applicable 
        geographic region, and that such plan or issuer will use that 
        database to determine a median in-network rate. The group 
        health plan or health insurance issuer shall cover the cost of 
        accessing the database.
            ``(4) Clarification.--For purposes of this subsection, the 
        Secretary may define geographic regions that are different from 
        the geographic regions identified for purposes of section 
        2729A(b) to ensure that an adequate number of air ambulance 
        services are in-network in each geographic region so that a 
        median in-network rate for air ambulance services may be 
        calculated for each such region.
    ``(d) Cost-sharing Limitation.--An air ambulance service provider 
may not bill an enrollee in a group health plan or group or individual 
health insurance coverage for amounts beyond the cost-sharing amount 
that applies under subsection (a).
    ``(e) Enforcement.--
            ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), an air 
        ambulance service provider that violates subsection (d) shall 
        be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 
        for each act constituting such violation.
            ``(2) Procedure.--The provisions of section 1128A of the 
        Social Security Act, other than subsections (a) and (b) and the 
        first sentence of subsection (c)(1) of such section, shall 
        apply to civil money penalties under this subsection in the 
        same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding 
        under section 1128A of the Social Security Act.
            ``(3) Safe harbor.--The Secretary shall waive the penalties 
        described under paragraph (1) with respect to a air ambulance 
        service provider who unknowingly violates subsection (d) with 
        respect to an enrollee, if such air ambulance service provider 
        within 30 days of the violation, withdraws the bill that was in 
        violation of subsection (d), and, as applicable, reimburses the 
        group health plan, health insurance issuer, or enrollee, as 
        applicable, in an amount equal to the amount billed in 
        violation of subsection (d), plus interest, at an interest rate 
        determined by the Secretary.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--Section 2719B of the Public Health Service 
Act, as added by subsection (a), shall take effect on the date that is 
1 year after the date of enactment of this Act.

``SEC. 503D. PROCESS TO UPDATE LABELING FOR CERTAIN DRUGS.

    ``(a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:
            ``(1) The term `covered drug' means a drug approved under 
        section 505(c)--
                    ``(A) for which there are no unexpired patents 
                included in the list under section 505(j)(7) and no 
                unexpired period of exclusivity;
                    ``(B) for which the approval of the application has 
                been withdrawn for reasons other than safety or 
                effectiveness; and
                    ``(C) for which, with respect to the labeling--
                            ``(i) new scientific evidence is available 
                        regarding the conditions of use of the drug;
                            ``(ii) there is a relevant accepted use in 
                        clinical practice that is not reflected in the 
                        approved labeling; or
                            ``(iii) the labeling of such drug does not 
                        reflect current legal and regulatory 
                        requirements.
            ``(2) The term `period of exclusivity', with respect to a 
        drug approved under section 505(c), means any period of 
        exclusivity under clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of section 
        505(c)(3)(E), clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of section 
        505(j)(5)(F), or section 505A, 505E, or 527.
            ``(3) The term `generic version' means a drug approved 
        under section 505(j) whose reference drug is a covered drug.
            ``(4) The term `relevant accepted use' means a use for a 
        drug in clinical practice that is supported by scientific 
        evidence that appears to the Secretary to meet the standards 
        for approval under section 505.
            ``(5) The term `selected drug' means a covered drug for 
        which the Secretary has determined through the process under 
        subsection (c) that the labeling should be changed.
    ``(b) Identification of Covered Drugs.--The Secretary may identify 
covered drugs for which labeling updates would provide a public health 
benefit. To assist in identifying covered drugs, the Secretary may do 
one or both of the following:
            ``(1) Enter into cooperative agreements or contracts with 
        public or private entities to review the available scientific 
        evidence concerning such drugs.
            ``(2) Seek public input concerning such drugs, including 
        input on whether there is a relevant accepted use in clinical 
        practice that is not reflected in the approved labeling of such 
        drugs or whether new scientific evidence is available regarding 
        the conditions of use for such drug, by--
                    ``(A) holding one or more public meetings;
                    ``(B) opening a public docket for the submission of 
                public comments; or
                    ``(C) other means, as the Secretary determines 
                appropriate.
    ``(c) Selection of Drugs for Updating.--If the Secretary 
determines, with respect to a covered drug, that the available 
scientific evidence meets the standards under section 505 for adding or 
modifying information to the labeling or providing supplemental 
information to the labeling regarding the use of the covered drug, the 
Secretary may initiate the process under subsection (d).
    ``(d) Initiation of the Process of Updating.--If the Secretary 
determines that labeling changes are appropriate for a selected drug 
pursuant to subsection (c), the Secretary shall provide notice to the 
holders of approved applications for a generic version of such drug 
that--
            ``(1) summarizes the findings supporting the determination 
        of the Secretary that the available scientific evidence meets 
        the standards under section 505 for adding or modifying 
        information or providing supplemental information to the 
        labeling of the covered drug pursuant to subsection (c);
            ``(2) provides a clear statement regarding the additional, 
        modified, or supplemental information for such labeling, 
        according to the determination by the Secretary (including, as 
        applicable, modifications to add the relevant accepted use to 
        the labeling of the drug as an additional indication for the 
        drug); and
            ``(3) states whether the statement under paragraph (2) 
        applies to the selected drug as a class of covered drugs or 
        only to a specific drug product.
    ``(e) Response to Notification.--Within 30 days of receipt of 
notification provided by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (d), the 
holder of an approved application for a generic version of the selected 
drug shall--
            ``(1) agree to change the approved labeling to reflect the 
        additional, modified, or supplemental information the Secretary 
        has determined to be appropriate; or
            ``(2) notify the Secretary that the holder of the approved 
        application does not believe that the requested labeling 
        changes are warranted and submit a statement detailing the 
        reasons why such changes are not warranted.
    ``(f) Review of Application Holder's Response.--
            ``(1) In general.--Upon receipt of the application holder's 
        response, the Secretary shall promptly review each statement 
        received under subsection (e)(2) and determine which labeling 
        changes pursuant to the Secretary's notice under subsection (d) 
        are appropriate, if any. If the Secretary disagrees with the 
        reasons why such labeling changes are not warranted, the 
        Secretary shall provide opportunity for discussions with the 
        application holders to reach agreement on whether the labeling 
        for the covered drug should be updated to reflect current 
        scientific evidence, and if so, the content of such labeling 
        changes.
            ``(2) Changes to labeling.--After considering all responses 
        from the holder of an approved application under paragraph (1) 
        or (2) of subsection (e), and any discussion under paragraph 
        (1), the Secretary may order such holder to make the labeling 
        changes the Secretary determines are appropriate. Such holder 
        of an approved application shall--
                    ``(A) update its paper labeling for the drug at the 
                next printing of that labeling;
                    ``(B) update any electronic labeling for the drug 
                within 30 days; and
                    ``(C) submit the revised labeling through the form, 
                `Supplement--Changes Being Effected'.
    ``(g) Violation.--If the holder of an approved application for the 
generic version of the selected drug does not comply with the 
requirements of subsection (f)(2), such generic version of the selected 
drug shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 502.
    ``(h) Limitations; Generic Drugs.--
            ``(1) In general.--With respect to any labeling change 
        required under this section, the generic version shall be 
        deemed to have the same conditions of use and the same labeling 
        as a reference drug for purposes of clauses (i) and (v) of 
        section 505(j)(2)(A). Any labeling change so required shall not 
        have any legal effect for the applicant that is different than 
        the legal effect that would have resulted if a supplemental 
        application had been submitted and approved to conform the 
        labeling of the generic version to a change in the labeling of 
        the reference drug.
            ``(2) Supplemental applications.--Changes to labeling made 
        in accordance with this paragraph shall not be eligible for an 
        exclusivity period under this Act.
    ``(i) Drug Product Classes.--In the case of a selected drug for 
which the labeling changes ordered by the Secretary under subsection 
(d)(2) are required for a class of covered drugs, such labeling changes 
shall be made for generic versions of such drug in that class.
    ``(j) Rules of Construction.--
            ``(1) Approval standards.--This section shall not be 
        construed as altering the applicability of the standards for 
        approval of an application under section 505. No order shall be 
        issued under this subsection unless the evidence supporting the 
        changed labeling meets the standards for approval applicable to 
        any change to labeling under section 505.
            ``(2) Removal of information.--Nothing in this section 
        shall be construed to give the Secretary additional authority 
        to remove approved indications for drugs, other than the 
        authority described in this section.
    ``(k) Reports.--Not later than 4 years after the date of the 
enactment of the Lower Health Care Costs Act and every 4 years 
thereafter, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee 
on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, a report that--
            ``(1) describes the actions of the Secretary under this 
        section, including--
                    ``(A) the number of covered drugs and description 
                of the types of drugs the Secretary has selected for 
                labeling changes and the rationale for such recommended 
                changes; and
                    ``(B) the number of times the Secretary entered 
                into discussions concerning a disagreement with an 
                application holder or holders and a summary of the 
                decision regarding a labeling change, if any; and
            ``(2) includes any recommendations of the Secretary for 
        modifying the program under this section.''.

                        developer a monetary amount sufficient to deter 
                        the license holder from failing to provide 
                        eligible product developers with sufficient 
                        quantities of a covered product on commercially 
                        reasonable, market-based terms, if the court 
                        finds, by a preponderance of the evidence--
                                    (I) that the license holder delayed 
                                providing sufficient quantities of the 
                                covered product to the eligible product 
                                developer without a legitimate business 
                                justification; or
                                    (II) that the license holder failed 
                                to comply with an order issued under 
                                clause (i).
                    (B) Maximum monetary amount.--A monetary amount 
                awarded under subparagraph (A)(iii) shall not be 
                greater than the revenue that the license holder earned 
                on the covered product during the period--
                            (i) beginning on--
                                    (I) for a covered product that is 
                                not subject to a REMS with ETASU, the 
                                date that is 31 days after the date on 
                                which the license holder received the 
                                request; or

                                that is 31 days after the later of--
                                            (aa) the date on which the 
                                        license holder received the 
                                        request; or
                                            (bb) the date on which the 
                                        license holder received a copy 
                                        of the covered product 
                                        authorization issued by the 
                                        Secretary in accordance with 
                                        paragraph (2)(B); and
                            (ii) ending on the date on which the 
                        eligible product developer received sufficient 
                        quantities of the covered product.
                    (C) Avoidance of delay.--The court may issue an 
                order under subparagraph (A)(i) before conducting 
                further proceedings that may be necessary to determine 
                whether the eligible product developer is entitled to 
                an award under clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph 
                (A), or the amount of any such award.
    (c) Limitation of Liability.--A license holder for a covered 
product shall not be liable for any claim under Federal, State, or 
local law arising out of the failure of an eligible product developer 
to follow adequate safeguards to assure safe use of the covered product 
during development or testing activities described in this section, 
including transportation, handling, use, or disposal of the covered 
product by the eligible product developer.
    (d) No Violation of REMS.--Section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subsection:
    ``(l) Provision of Samples Not a Violation of Strategy.--The 
provision of samples of a covered product to an eligible product 
developer (as those terms are defined in section 214(a) of the Lower 
Health Care Costs Act) shall not be considered a violation of the 
requirements of any risk evaluation and mitigation strategy that may be 
in place under this section for such drug.''.
    (e) Rule of Construction.--
            (1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``antitrust 
        laws''--
                    (A) has the meaning given the term in subsection 
                (a) of the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 
                12); and
                    (B) includes section 5 of the Federal Trade 
                Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to the extent that such 
                section applies to unfair methods of competition.
            (2) Antitrust laws.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        construed to limit the operation of any provision of the 
        antitrust laws.
    (f) REMS Approval Process for Subsequent Filers.--Section 505-1 of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1), as amended 
by subsection (d), is further amended--
            (1) in subsection (g)(4)(B)--
                    (A) in clause (i) by striking ``or'' after the 
                semicolon;
                    (B) in clause (ii) by striking the period at the 
                end and inserting ``; or''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
                            ``(iii) accommodate different, comparable 
                        aspects of the elements to assure safe use for 
                        a drug that is the subject of an application 
                        under section 505(j), and the applicable listed 
                        drug.'';
            (2) in subsection (i)(1), by striking subparagraph (C) and 
        inserting the following:
                    ``(C)(i) Elements to assure safe use, if required 
                under subsection (f) for the listed drug, which, 
                subject to clause (ii), for a drug that is the subject 
                of an application under section 505(j) may use--
                            ``(I) a single, shared system with the 
                        listed drug under subsection (f); or

                        the elements to assure safe use under 
                        subsection (f).
                    ``(ii) The Secretary may require a drug that is the 
                subject of an application under section 505(j) and the 
                listed drug to use a single, shared system under 
                subsection (f), if the Secretary determines that no 
                different, comparable aspect of the elements to assure 
                safe use could satisfy the requirements of subsection 
                (f).'';
            (3) in subsection (i), by adding at the end the following:
            ``(3) Shared rems.--If the Secretary approves, in 
        accordance with paragraph (1)(C)(i)(II), a different, 
        comparable aspect of the elements to assure safe use under 
        subsection (f) for a drug that is the subject of an abbreviated 
        new drug application under section 505(j), the Secretary may 
        require that such different comparable aspect of the elements 
        to assure safe use can be used with respect to any other drug 
        that is the subject of an application under section 505(j) or 
        505(b) that references the same listed drug.''; and
            (4) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(m) Separate REMS.--When used in this section, the terms 
`different, comparable aspect of the elements to assure safe use' or 
`different, comparable approved risk evaluation and mitigation 
strategies' means a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for a drug 
that is the subject of an application under section 505(j) that uses 
different methods or operational means than the strategy required under 
subsection (a) for the applicable listed drug, or other application 
under section 505(j) with the same such listed drug, but achieves the 
same level of safety as such strategy.''.
    (g) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section, the amendments 
made by this section, or in section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1), shall be construed as--
            (1) prohibiting a license holder from providing an eligible 
        product developer access to a covered product in the absence of 
        an authorization under this section; or
            (2) in any way negating the applicability of a REMS with 
        ETASU, as otherwise required under such section 505-1, with 
        respect to such covered product.

have in place business processes to ensure the timely provision of 
provider directory information to a group health plan or a health 
insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage

under sections 1176 and 1177 of the Social Security Act, when making 
determinations relating to fines under section 13410, decreasing the 
length and extent of an audit under section 13411, or remedies 
otherwise agreed to by the Secretary, the Secretary shall consider 
whether the covered entity or business associate has adequately 
demonstrated that it had, for not less than the previous 12 months, 
recognized security practices in place that may--
            ``(1) mitigate fines under section 13410;
            ``(2) result in the early, favorable termination of an 
        audit under section 13411; and

        to in any agreement with respect to resolving potential 
        violations of the HIPAA Security rule (part 160 of title 45 
        Code of Federal Regulations and subparts A and C of part 164 of 
        such title) between the covered entity or business associate

        and Technology Act, the approaches promulgated under section 
        405(d) of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, and other programs and 
        processes that address cybersecurity and that are developed, 
        recognized, or promulgated through regulations under other 
        statutory authorities. Such practices shall be determined by 
        the covered entity or business associate.
            ``(2) Limitation.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        construed as providing the Secretary authority to increase 
        fines under section 13410, or the length, extent or quantity of 
        audits under section 13411, due to a lack of compliance with 
        the recognized security practices.
            ``(3) No liability for nonparticipation.--Subject to 
        paragraph (4), nothing in this section shall be construed to 
        subject a covered entity or business associate to liability for 
        electing not to engage in the recognized security practices 
        defined by this section.
            ``(4) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section shall 
        be construed to limit the Secretary's authority to enforce the 
        HIPAA Security rule (part 160 of title 45 Code of Federal 
        Regulations and subparts A and C of part 164 of such title), or

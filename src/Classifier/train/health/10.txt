``SEC. 1150E. PATIENT-PROVIDER DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

    ``(a) In General.--Not later than July 1, 2021, the Secretary shall 
establish a process (in this subsection referred to as the `patient-
provider dispute resolution process') under which an uninsured 
individual, with respect to an item or service, who received, pursuant

facility a good-faith estimate of the expected charges for furnishing 
such item or service to such individual and who after being furnished 
such item or service by such provider or facility is billed by such 
provider or facility for such item or service for charges that are 
substantially in excess of such estimate, may seek a determination from 
a selected dispute resolution entity for the charges to be paid by such 
individual (in lieu of such amount so billed) to such provider or 
facility for such item or service. For purposes of this subsection, the 
term `uninsured individual' means, with respect to an item or service, 
an individual who does not have benefits for such item or service under 
a group health plan, health insurance coverage offered in the group or 
individual market by a health insurance issuer, Federal health care 
program (as defined in section 1128B(f)), or a health benefits plan

has benefits for such item or service under a group health plan or 
health insurance coverage offered in the group or individual market by 
a health insurance issuer, but who does not seek to have a claim for 
such item or service submitted to such plan or coverage).
    ``(b) Selection of Entities.--Under the patient-provider dispute 
resolution process, the Secretary shall, with respect to a 
determination sought by an individual under subsection (a), with 
respect to charges to be paid by such individual to a health care 
provider or health care facility described in such paragraph for an 
item or service furnished to such individual by such provider or 
facility, provide for--
            ``(1) a method to select to make such determination an 
        entity certified under subsection (d) that--
                    ``(A) is not a party to such determination or an 
                employee or agent of such party;
                    ``(B) does not have a material familial, financial, 
                or professional relationship with such a party; and

                interest with such a party (as determined by the 
                Secretary); and
            ``(2) the provision of a notification of such selection to 
        the individual and the provider or facility (as applicable) 
        party to such determination.
An entity selected pursuant to the previous sentence to make a 
determination described in such sentence shall be referred to in this 
subsection as the `selected dispute resolution entity' with respect to 
such determination.
    ``(c) Administrative Fee.--The Secretary shall establish a fee to 
participate in the patient-provider dispute resolution process in such 
a manner as to not create a barrier to an uninsured individual's access 
to such process.
    ``(d) Certification.--The Secretary shall establish or recognize a 
process to certify entities under this subparagraph. Such process shall 
ensure that an entity so certified satisfies at least the criteria 
specified in section 2719A(j)(7) of the Public Health Service Act.''.

(a)Findings
Congress finds that—

(5)providing quality services to individuals improves the confidence of the people of the United States in their Government and helps agencies achieve greater impact and fulfill their missions; and

(b)Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress that—

(1)all agencies should strive to provide high-quality, courteous, effective, and efficient services to the people of the United States and seek to measure, collect, report, and utilize metrics relating to the experience of individuals interacting with agencies to continually improve services to the people of the United States; and

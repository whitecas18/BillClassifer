Extensions of RemarksE193 February 21, 2020 HONORING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF BAKU POGROMS HON. TJ COX OFCALIFORNIA
 INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, February 21, 2020 Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, this year we mark the 30th anniversary of the anti- 
Armenian pogroms that took place in Baku, 
Azerbaijan. These pogroms were a continu-
ation of a longstanding pattern of increasingly 
violent attacks against Armenians. During a 
week-long pogrom, Armenians in Baku were 
killed, tortured, robbed, and tens of thousands 
were forced to flee their homes to escape per-
secution, causing families to be uprooted and 
torn apart. The Azerbaijani leadership has yet to be held accountable for this violence against its 
Armenian civilians. Instead of condemning 
these atrocities of decades ago, the Aliyev 
government continues holding a militant policy 
against Armenians, especially within the re-
gion of Nagorno-Karabakh. I call upon my colleagues to join me in con-demning this atrocity, strengthening our ties to 
the Republic of Artsakh, and holding Azer-
baijan accountable for its actions. While we 
mourn the lives lost in this tragedy, it is imper-
ative that we encourage Azerbaijan to ac-
knowledge their past and that we press for-
ward with the bipartisan Royce-Engel peace 
proposals. Madam Speaker, we must follow a prin-cipled U.S. policyŠcondemning violence and 
promoting peaceŠboth by securing foreign aid 
to Nagorno-Karabakh and withholding financial 
and military support from Azerbaijan. I look 
forward to working with my colleagues on the 
Armenian Caucus to continue pushing policies 
promoting peace and human rights for Arme-
nians and for all. f RECOGNIZING STEVE COKER HON. TRENT KELLY OFMISSISSIPPI
 INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, February 21, 2020 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding Mis-
sissippian, New Albany Fire Chief Steve 
Coker, who is retiring after an impressive ca-
reer. Steve Coker began his lifelong career in 1991 with the East Union Volunteer Fire De-
partment in Union County, Mississippi. His ex-
cellent service earned him the title of Fire 
Chief of East Union, and later, he became the 
Union County Fire Coordinator. Steve was 
also selected to serve with the Mississippi Fire 
Chiefs Association as Northeast District Vice 
President. I thank Steve for his lifelong dedication to fire safety and for making Mississippi a better 
place. I wish him many years of good health and hope he enjoys his well-deserved retire-ment. f CHRISTINE ARBOGAST HON. ED PERLMUTTER OFCOLORADO
 INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, February 21, 2020 Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Christine 
Arbogast for receiving the 2020 Wayne N. 
Aspinall Water Leader of the Year award pre-
sented by the Colorado Water Congress. This lifetime achievement award honors Coloradans who have long demonstrated 
courage, dedication, knowledge, and strong 
leadership in the development, protection, and 
preservation of Colorado water. As only the 
third woman to receive this prestigious honor, 
Christine exemplifies all of these qualities and 
is deserving of this recognition. Christine is the 
President of Centennial-based Kogovsek & 
Associates, specializing in water management, 
development and conservation, the use and 
protection of public lands, and American In-
dian issues. Christine has worked for decades 
on these issues and has made an impact on 
the state of Colorado. She is the current Presi-
dent of the National Water Resources Asso-
ciation and led its Federal Affairs Committee 
for years. Christine is also the President of the 
non-profit Women in Water Scholarship Fund. 
She previously served as a Special Projects 
Administrator for the Colorado Department of 
Agriculture. Christine™s contribution to our state is re-markable as exemplified by the Colorado 
Southeastern Water Conservancy District 
when they stated, ‚‚She was instrumental in 
completing the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Rights 
Settlement, defeating American Water Devel-
opment Inc.™s attempt to appropriate Rio 
Grande groundwater, and creating the Great 
Sand Dunes National Park and Rio Grande 
Natural Area.™™ Christine™s dedication to the development, protection, and preservation of Colorado water 
is tremendous. I extend my deepest congratu-
lations to my friend Christine Arbogast on this 
honor and for her contributions to our commu-
nity and the entire State of Colorado. f IOWAN OF THE WEEKŠDR. VERGARIE SANFORD HON. CYNTHIA AXNE OFIOWA

 Friday, February 21, 2020 Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me

ing God by serving others. Dr. Sanford en-
gages young women, providing mentorship for 
girls between ages 12 and 18. She has also 
worked in local middle schools on bullying pre-
vention programs. Her dedication to bettering 
her community is shown in her multiple mem-
berships on the boards of local Council Bluffs 
organizations. Dr. Sanford is a true community 
leader and servant. Born and raised in Council Bluffs, Dr. San-ford is dedicated to continued learning that al-
lows her to better serve her fellow Iowans. 
She graduated from Abraham Lincoln High 
School and attended Iowa Western; most re-
cently, she received her Ph.D. in Educational 
Leadership from Oral Roberts University, and 
I know her community is deeply proud of this 
accomplishment. She said she is inspired by 
Matthew 9:37 which reads ‚‚the harvest is 
plentiful but the laborers are few™™ which 
speaks to her heart and desire to serve her 
community. Dr. Sanford is on the Board of Directors of Children™s Square U.S.A., which provides be-
havioral health, educational services, child 
welfare, and emergency services to families. 
She is also the Vice Chair on the Board of Di-
rectors of Centro Latino. This organization cre-
ated a social services office in Council Bluffs 
to help the growing Latino community navigate 
through different resources including pantry 
services, housing assistance, applications to 
Medicaid, SNAP, and unemployment. Through 
her work, Iowans are getting access to serv-
ices they need to support their families. It is an honor to commemorate the out-standing achievement of Dr. Sanford and cele-
brate the hard work that she has put in to give 
back to her community. I have great respect 
and admiration for activists like Dr. Sanford 
who continue to build up others and help them 
fulfill their needs. f HONORING THE HONORABLE SYLVIA GALE HON. ANN M. KUSTER OFNEWHAMPSHIRE

 INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, February 21, 2020 Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with great joy that I rise today to congratulate 
MYST Hibachi/Sushi/Gastropub in Jim Thorpe 
on their recent grand opening. Small business owners and entrepreneurs, like Mike Heiser and Josh Crownover, co-own-
ers of MYST, are the lifeblood of our commu-
nities. From its pleasant restaurants to charm-
ing stores, Jim Thorpe thrives on the innova-
tive small businesses and those who support 
them. I am confident that MYST will be a fan-
tastic addition to Carbon County™s flourishing 
small business community. Jim Thorpe is a true gem in Pennsylvania™s Ninth District. This quaint town welcomes 
thousands of visitors each year who come to 
enjoy its beauty, explore its unique shops and 
restaurants and appreciate the pristine nature 
that surrounds it. MYST will continue to build 
on the distinctive experiences Jim Thorpe of-
fers to residents and tourists alike. On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-tives and the citizens of Pennsylvania™s Ninth 
Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in congratulating MYST on their grand 
opening. We wish them the best of luck and 
success on their new business endeavor. f IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 1494ŠHISTORI-CALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND 
UNIVERSITIES (HBCUS) HOME-LAND SECURITY PARTNERSHIPS 
ACT HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE OFTEXAS
 INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, February 21, 2020 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a member of the bipartisan Congressional 
HBCU Caucus and an original co-sponsor, I 
rise in support of H.R. 1494, the Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) 
Homeland Security Partnerships Act, which 
strengthens partnerships between historically 
Black colleges and universities and minority- 
serving institutions, and the Department of 
Homeland Security. As a strong proponent of the preservation of our nation™s HBCU™s and MSI™s, I support this 
bill because our students deserve to receive 
an outstanding education and have access to 
equal resources, regardless of the institution 
they choose to attend. H.R. 1494 would improve the quality of HBCU™s and minority serving institutions by al-
lowing the Department of Homeland Security 
to promote recruitment, hiring, research and 
acquisition opportunities. H.R. 1494 also requires the Department of Homeland Security to send each HBCU and 
minority-serving institution a comprehensive 
list of internship, fellowship, scholarship and recruitment opportunities within the Depart-ment for students and graduates of such insti-
tutions. In addition to the implementation of strate-gies to improve governmental relations with 
these colleges, universities and institutions, 
the DHS will submit reports detailing financial 
awards, descriptions of how the partnerships 
are enforced, and summaries of outreach ef-
forts to HBCU™s and minority-serving institu-
tions. Madam Speaker, I am proud that one of the greatest HBCUs in the country, Texas South-
ern University, is located in my congressional 
district. Texas Southern University has a rich history with nine academic units, 1,000 dedicated 
staff members, and over 9,200 esteemed stu-
dents. Like most of my HBCU Caucus colleagues, I have worked closely with my local HBCU to 
provide funding and resources needed to en-
able them to fulfill their mission of educating 
the next generation of social engineers and 
conducting research programs addressing 
issues of major concern to the African Amer-
ican community. As Chairwoman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security and 
Infrastructure Protection in the 111th Con-
gress, I authored the legislation to establish a 
Transportation Security Center of Excellence 
at TSU and worked to help TSU secure $1.2 
million in funding over four years from the De-
partment of Homeland Security for this Center 
of Excellence. One of my proudest accomplishments as a member of Congress is my success in working 
with federal officials in the Clinton Administra-
tion to settle the lawsuit against TSU that had 
been pending for more than 23 years. I was proud to spearhead the initiative that brought more than $13 million in financial aid 
relief for the students and campus of Texas 
Southern University. I also worked with TSU administrators to ini-tiate digital archive projects to preserve the 
records of two of its most distinguished alum-
ni, the legendary Barbara Jordan and Mickey 
Leland, both of whom preceded me as the 
Member of Congress for the Eighteenth Con-
gressional District of Texas. I was pleased to facilitate a partnership be-tween Comcast and TSU™s School of Commu-
nication to provide scholarships and intern-
ships to TSU students and in-kind marketing 
services to the university. I helped secure funding needed to establish the Center for Transportation, Training and 
Research in the TSU College of Science, En-
gineering, and Technology. HBCU™s have played a critical role in Amer-ican history. As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. stat-ed: ‚‚The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intel-
ligence plus characterŠthat is the goal of true 
education.™™ HBCUs do not just educateŠHBCUs have and will continue to fill an important role in 
education opportunity and engagement for mil-
lions of young people from diverse back-
grounds. Funds provided by the Science and Tech-nology Directorate grants and cooperative 
agreements will provide enhancements in 
areas relating to homeland security such as cybersecurity, emergency management and counterterrorism. As leaders of this country, the success and expansion of HBCUs and minority-serving in-
stitutions falls on our shoulders and we must 
act swiftly to ensure that these institutions are 
protected. In an effort to maintain the legacy and edu-cational quality of our historically Black col-
leges and universities and minority-serving in-
stitutions, we must act urgently to ensure the 
proper relationships are established between 
all of these institutions and the Department of 
Homeland Security. I ask all members to join me in voting for H.R. 1494, the Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities (HBCUs) Homeland Security Part-
nerships Act. f HONORING A.E. HOTCHNER HON. STEVE COHEN OFTENNESSEE
 INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, February 21, 2020 Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in admiration of the life of A.E. 
Hotchner, the novelist, bon vivant, friend-of- 
the-famous and philanthropist who died last 
Saturday at the age of 102. Mr. Hotchner led 
a charmed life filled with movie stars, musi-
cians, and literary lions. He was known as a 
loyal friend and companion, particularly to the 
likes of Ernest Hemingway and his Con-
necticut neighbor Paul Newman. With Mr. 
Newman, he founded Newman™s Own, a non-
profit brand of salad dressings and sauces 
created to underwrite charitable causes that 
has, since 1982, delivered hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars to good causes. He and Mr. 
Newman also founded the Hole in the Wall 
Gang in 1988 for children with life-threatening 
illnesses, underwritten in part by a 1991 Lin-
coln Center benefit gala starring Julia Roberts, 
Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Matt 
Damon, Joanne Woodward and her husband, 
Mr. Newman. It was Mr. Hotchner™s adaptation 
of one of Hemingway™s short stories, ‚‚The 
Boxer,™™ that introduced him to a young Paul 
Newman, who played the part of the boxer 
originally intended for James Dean after Dean 
was killed in a car crash in 1955. A St. Louis 
native and a graduate of Washington Univer-
sity in St. Louis and its law school, Mr. 
Hotchner met Hemingway in 1948 as a literary 
agent for Cosmopolitan magazine, where his 
job was to persuade famous people to write 
for the publication. He found Hemingway in 
Cuba, beginning a friendship of travel and 
drinking that included Spanish bullfights and 
hunting in Idaho and only ended with Heming-
way™s suicide in 1961. The best known of his 
many works about celebrities was Papa Hem-ingway: A Personal Memoir (1966). He also published a book of their correspondence, 
Dear Papa, Dear Hotch (2005) and two plays about the Nobel Prize winning novelist. Mr. 
Hotchner also wrote about film stars Clark 
Gable, Marlene Dietrich, Doris Day, and So-
phia Loren; about the heiress Barbara Hutton 
and the French fashion designer Coco Chanel; 
and the illustrated history Everyone Comes to Elaine™s, about the Manhattan nightspot fa-mous for its prominent clientele. Mr. Hotchner 
was famous in his own right for a series of 
memoirs, historical novels and plays. His play VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:08 Feb 22, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00002Fmt 0626Sfmt 9920E:\CR\FM\A21FE8.005E21FEPT1

 INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, February 21, 2020 Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Jack Baskin, a promi-
nent engineer, builder, and philanthropist on 
the central coast of California. Jack will be re-
membered as a generous and active sup-
porter of his community. Jack Baskin was born on September 20, 1919, in upstate New York. After graduating 
from New York University with a degree in 
aeronautical engineering in 1940, Jack used 
his engineering expertise to support the do-
mestic military aircraft manufacturing industry 
through World War II. After the war, he found 
success building housing developments 
throughout California and settled on the Cen-
tral Coast in Santa Cruz in 1970. Jack remained in Santa Cruz for the next 50 years, establishing deep ties to the Central 
Coast. Jack is well-known for acts of kindness 
and generosity to support his community and 
was named the ‚‚Man of the Year™™ by the 
Santa Cruz County Chamber of Commerce in 
1986. Many local institutions have benefitted 
from his personal donations, including the Do-
minican Hospital of Santa Cruz, Monterey Pe-
ninsula College, Cabrillo College, and the Sey-
mour Marine Laboratory. Jack was especially passionate about sup-porting the University of California, Santa Cruz 
campus, establishing the funding that was 
used to build the Baskin School of Engineer-
ing and make UCSC a destination to study 
and develop technical innovations. In 2008, 
Jack and his wife, Peggy, established the 
Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation to provide 
financial support for educational opportunities 
for disadvantaged women and other 
marginalized communities on the Central 
Coast. Jack will be remembered for his convivial and generous spirit. We, as a community, cel-
ebrate his legacy and life well-lived. Madam 
Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in 
honoring the life of Jack Baskin. f RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE LEAGUE OF 
WOMEN VOTERS OF NORTH AND 
CENTRAL SAN MATEO COUNTY HON. JACKIE SPEIER OFCALIFORNIA
 INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, February 21, 2020 Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the 100th Anniversary of the League of Women Voters, an organization that was founded to prepare the implementation of the 
19th Amendment of the United States Con-
stitution giving women the right to vote. The 
League of Women Voters of North and Central 
San Mateo County join more than 700 local 
and state chapters to celebrate the historic 
centennial of the 19th Amendment. When LWV was born on February 14, 1920, six months before the 19th Amendment was 
ratified, founder Carrie Chapman Catt believed 
the organization could give millions of women 
voters a crash course in civic engagement and 
the American political system. Formed by the 
suffragists of the National American Women 
Suffrage Association, the league started out 
as a political experiment designed to help 20 
million women carry out their newly won right 
to vote. The right to vote is at the very core of our Republic. Our Founding Fathers wisely en-
shrined that right of every citizen to make 
changes in our political system in the first 
three words of our Constitution: ‚‚We The Peo-
ple.™™ Sadly, our Founding Fathers did not in-
clude women, and it took another 131 years to 
get the 19th Amendment ratified. It was an ugly battle. After it passed the House and Senate, anti-suffrage groups mobi-
lized to continue their pressure campaign in 
the states. I have two framed documents in 
my Washington, D.C., office that I like to show 
visitors to illustrate that tension. One is an 
original copy of the 1871 petition from suffra-
gist Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady 
Stanton urging Congress to give women the 
right to vote. The other is a 1917 letter from 
the National Association Opposed to Woman 
Suffrage arguing that the 19th Amendment 
would be an ‚‚official endorsement of nagging 
as a national policy;™™ that it would ‚‚give every 
radical woman the right to believe that she 
could get any law she wanted by ‚pestering.™™™ 
The same year, 1917, the National Wom-en™s Party picketed the White House to pres-
sure President Woodrow Wilson. No one had 
ever picketed the White House before and the 
women were met with hostility from angry 
mobs. They were yelled at, spat on, peppered 
with rotten eggs and even beaten and sexually 
assaulted. On November 14, 1917, after being 
arrested, a group of women were met at the 
prison by guards with clubs, and 33 women 
were choked, kicked, and one was stabbed 
between the eyes. They were fed rotten food 
and denied medical treatment. When some 
women went on a hunger strike, they were 
force fed with tubes through their noses. This 
‚‚Night of Terror™™ has been forgotten by most 
Americans today, but it illustrates the hard- 
fought battles for women to finally gain the 
right to vote on August 26th, Women™s Equal-
ity Day. To this day the League of Women Voters, of which I am a proud member, continues to reg-
ister, educate, and mobilize voters reaffirming 
its commitment to ‚‚Making Democracy Work.™™ 
While its mission hasn™t, changed, the league 
is taking advantage of new tools, such as 
VOTE411.org, a cutting-edge website utilized 
by millions of voters, to make it even more ef-
fective. Madam Speaker, for a century, the League of Women Voters has empowered voters and 
defended democracy. It has evolved from a 
political experiment designed to help 20 million 
newly-enfranchised women to vote in 1920 to 
a nonpartisan organization shaping public pol-icy, molding political leaders, and promoting citizen engagement. May it not take another 
100 years until every citizen eligible to vote 
will cast her or his ballot to protect and be part 
of our democracy. f PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. ANNA G. ESHOO OFCALIFORNIA

BROWN HON. DOUG COLLINS OFGEORGIA
 INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, February 21, 2020 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Oakwood City Manager 
Stan Brown for his service to the people of 
northeast Georgia. Mr. Brown is retiring on 
February 28, 2020 after serving the city of 
Oakwood for 16 years. Mr. Brown has worked in local government for over 25 years, holding various positions 
across northeast Georgia, including in the city 
of Carrollton, Athens-Clarke County, and Jack-
son County. In 2004, Mr. Brown was ap-
pointed as Oakwood City Manager, where he 
was tasked with maintaining economic devel-
opment and promoting the interests of the 
local community. Throughout his tenure, he 
worked closely with the Greater Hall Chamber 
of Commerce, the Economic Development 
Council, the Lake Lanier Convention and Visi-
tors Bureau, and the Hall County Green Alli-
ance to ensure the city is proactive and able 
to meet the challenges and opportunities of 
growth while also guaranteeing the best qual-
ity of life for its residents. While Mr. Brown™s time spent serving in local government spans over two decades, his 
commitment to service began long before his 
tenure as Oakwood City Manager. Mr. Brown 
attended and graduated from the United 
States Air Force Academy and served his na-
tion for many years, including overseas in 
Iraq, Kuwait, and Kyrgyzstan, retiring as a 
Lieutenant Colonel. Mr. Brown continued his 
service as a member of my military academy 
nomination board, where he played an instru-
mental role in selecting future leaders in the 
U.S. military. From his military service to his work in local government, Stan Brown has dedicated his life 
to serving his fellow citizens, putting his heart 
and soul into serving our country and our 
community. I join the people of northeast 
Georgia in thanking him for his years of com-
mitment to the city of Oakwood, and I wish 
him all the best in his next chapter of life. VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:08 Feb 22, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00003Fmt 0626Sfmt 0634E:\CR\FM\A21FE8.008E21FEPT1

 Friday, February 21, 2020 Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations to Ed Mor-
rison, and the entire Shelly & Sands Inc. team 
of my hometown, Zanesville, Ohio, on winning 
the National Asphalt Pavement Associations™ 
Sheldon G. Haynes Award. To be eligible for the Sheldon G. Haynes award, a paving company must first win the 
Pavement Associations Quality in Construction 
award for a project using more than 50,000 
tons of asphalt. Paving companies must sub-
mit projects from across the United States to 
be judged by an independent pavement con-
sultant. The projects are then judged on pave-
ment smoothness, safety, and durability, and 
innovative techniques used during the 
projects. Of the thousands of largescale pav-
ing projects submitted every year, four compa-
nies are considered finalists and only one 
company wins. The IŒ77 roadway in Guernsey County, Ohio presented a unique paving challenge for 
Quality Control Director Ed Morrison and the 
Shelly & Sands team. Shelly & Sands began 
paving in the middle of a bridge construction 
project. The team used innovative thermal 
cameras to ensure even asphalt cooling for 
surface smoothness and durability. This was 
just one of many masterful techniques used by 
the Shelly & Sands team to achieve success 
in this project. I again extend my warmest congratulations to Ed and his team on this prestigious award. 
I look forward to hearing more about their fu-
ture endeavors and wish them continued suc-
cess in paving high quality, largescale projects 
throughout Ohio. f IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 4432ŠPRO-TECTING CRITICAL INFRASTRUC-

 INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, February 21, 2020 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a senior member of Congress, I rise in support 
of H.R. 4432, the Protecting Critical Infrastruc-
ture Against Drones and Emerging Threats 
Act, which requires a full assessment of 
threats relating to unmanned aircrafts, devel-
opment and dissemination of a security threat 
assessment regarding unmanned aircrafts and 
similar technologies, and the establishment of 
secure communications and critical information 
technology infrastructure to properly utilize an-
alytical tools. By requiring the Under Secretary for Intel-ligence and Analysis of the Department of 
Homeland Security to prepare a threat assess-
ment within one year of the bill™s enactment to 
share with the House and Senate Homeland 
Security committees, Congress and the Presi-
dent can act swiftly to prevent any potential 
risks. With national security as one of our nation™s top priorities, we must begin to fully determine the risks posed by this advanced and increas-ingly popular technology. The data will be collected from agencies through data-mining and other advanced diag-
nostic tools at the Federal, state and local lev-
els, as well as various infrastructure owners 
and operators. Assessment of the data will include a report and classified plan to alleviate any potential threats through the use of unmanned aircrafts. The Federal Aviation Administration re-ported a total of 1.1 million small hobbyist 
drones and about 412,000 commercial drone 
registrations for the year 2019. The use of unmanned aircrafts is growing rapidly, both as a hobby and for commercial 
purposes, including in the oil and gas industry. I ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to vote in support of H.R. 4432. f CONGRATULATING JUDGE JACK B. WEINSTEIN HON. STEVE COHEN OFTENNESSEE
 INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, February 21, 2020 Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate U.S. District Judge Jack B. 
Weinstein of Brooklyn on his retirement after 
53 years on the bench at the age of 98. Judge 
Weinstein is well known for his liberal sen-
sibilities, especially for his suggested reforms 
of sentencing guidelines to reduce the length 
of time most offenders spend behind bars. I 
related to him as a champion of women™s 
rights, criminal justice reform and the lack of 
sentencing alternatives for young offenders. A 
submarine officer in the Pacific Theatre in 
World War II, he returned home and was a 
1948 graduate of Columbia University Law 
School. As a young lawyer, he worked on 
briefs in the landmark Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation desegregation case and recently la-
mented that, in New York as in so many other 
places, re-segregation of public schools is the 
reality. In a long and colorful career on the 
bench after being nominated to the district 
court by President Lyndon Johnson in 1967, 
Judge Weinstein presided at the trial of Vin-
cent ‚‚The Chin™™ Gigante, the head of the 
Genovese crime family, and massive tort 
cases involving asbestos and Agent Orange. 
In a recent interview with The New York 
Times, he said that, although the country is 
‚‚going downhill™™ with a ‚‚very conservative™™ 
Supreme Court at the moment, he was opti-
mistic for the future because it is ‚‚essentially 
a good country made up of people who will 
fight for what™s right.™™ It™s nice to know that 
Judge Weinstein, in retirement with his newly 
retired physician son, will be studying how 
post-Civil War Reconstruction devolved into 
Jim Crowism as they both pursue master™s de-
grees in history. I wish Judge Weinstein, a 
productive and fulfilling retirement and thank 
him for his long service to our country. CONGRATULATING HOBBIE VOLUN-TEER FIRE COMPANY ON THEIR

Company in Luzerne County, PA on their 70th

lin. Since then, thousands of brave and coura-
geous firefighters have carried on our Com-
monwealth™s distinguished legacy of selfless-
ness, community service and commitment to 
safety. Each member of Hobbie Volunteer Fire Company has continued to build on the prin-
ciples of professionalism and service since 
their founding on October 23, 1949. Over 70 
years later, they have remained steadfast in 
their dedication to serving and protecting the 
people of Hollenback Township and the sur-
rounding communities. This 70th anniversary 
is a great milestone for the Hobbie Volunteer 
Fire Company. I am grateful for all the past, 
present and future members of the department 
and their unyielding commitment to public 
safety. On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-tives and the citizens of Pennsylvania™s Ninth

wish you many more years of safety and serv-

de Jesus Garcia, who migrated from Mexico in 
1915. At an early age, he was interested in 
serving the country that he so loved, and he 
carried such adoration throughout his life. He 
joined the United States Navy at the age of 
17, where he eventually served in the Pacific 
Theater and in the liberation of the Philippine

I am deeply saddened by his loss, I am com-
forted by knowing that his memory will live on

IN WEST PALM BEACH HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS OFFLORIDA
 INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, February 21, 2020 Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize the legacy of the 
Tabernacle Baptist Church, a historically black 
church located in West Palm Beach, Florida. 
The Tabernacle Baptist Church was estab-
lished in 1893, before the creation of the town 
of West Palm Beach in 1894. The Church has 
proven to be a pillar and haven in the commu-
nity throughout its 127-year history and con-
tinues to maintain its strong presence today. The Church™s leadership through various projects, such as the establishment of the U.B. 
Kinsey Educational and Community Center, 
and the Rosemary Village Construction 
Project, illustrates a dedication to a holistic, 
community-driven mission. The Church has 
also created the first school for African Amer-
ican children in Palm Beach County and con-
tinues to champion education through pro-
grams such as their scholarship committee. 
Throughout the years, the Church has re-
mained a steadfast spiritual guide and support 
and strives to strengthen its presence in order 
to better serve Palm Beach County. Under the leadership of Rev. Gerald D. Kisner, Pastor of Tabernacle Missionary Bap-
tist Church for the past 23 years; Reverend 
Kevin L. Jones, Assistant Pastor of Taber-
nacle Missionary Baptist Church and the 
Church™s Minister for Youth and Young Adults; 
and Ms. Gwendolyn Ferguson, Executive As-
sistant of the Church, they have carried the 
mission of the Church to serve as God™s wit-
nesses or ambassadors to people who are in 
need, through discipleship, outreach, teaching, 
preaching, community development, praise 
and worship. Madam Speaker, the Tabernacle Baptist Church is indeed an exemplary part of our 
community. I extend my warmest congratula-
tions to the Church for its contributions over 
these 127 years and wish them many more 
years of continued success. f CONGRATULATING STAFF SER-GEANT DANIEL ACOSTA ON

 INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, February 21, 2020 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on Home-
land Security, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
5273, the ‚‚Securing America™s Ports Act.™™ I voted for H.R. 5273 because it secures America™s land ports of entry along the border 
by increasing the rate of expeditious scanning 
of commercial and passenger vehicles enter-
ing the United States. But Madam Speaker, this bill does more than just secure the border. H.R. 5273 also encourages the continuation of cross-cultural interactions through tourism 
and trade across an increasingly secure bor-
der and encourages the rich diversity of inter-
actions and cooperation between the United 
States and Mexico as well as ensures mutual 
economic success. As many of you know, Texas shares the longest border with Mexico of any states in the 
Union at 1,254 miles. Over time, the southwest region of the country has become the largest manufacturing 
corridor in the world. In 2019, it was estimated that two-way trade between the United States and Mexico sur-
passed $600 billion. Trade between Texas and Mexico alone was approximately $200 billion each year. In fact, in a single day, more than one mil-lion people come and go across the border, 
along with 300,000 vehicles and over 75,000 
trucks. This magnitude of crossings at the border demands our attention. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses these systems to inspect contents of commer-
cial and passenger vehicles for potential con-
traband, such as drugs, without physically 
opening or unloading the vehicles. My congressional district is home to one of the most racially and culturally diverse com-
munities in the United States . In the 18th Congressional District of Texas, 39.1 percent of people identify as Hispanic or 
Latino, 39.9 percent identify as Black or Afri-
can American, and 45.4 percent identify as 
White. VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:08 Feb 22, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00005Fmt 0626Sfmt 9920E:\CR\FM\A21FE8.017E21FEPT1

Extensions of RemarksE198 February 21, 2020 Throughout my time in Congress, I have sought to propose and support legislation that 
increases the efficiency of operations at the 
border in addition to encouraging trade for the 
economic betterment of Texans. For example, I supported H.R. 4940, the Border and Port Security Act, which prioritized 
improving the level of efficiency at the border 
by requiring the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to hire, train, and assign at least 
500 new officers. By adding qualified CBP agents, H.R. 4940 would help resolve CBP™s understaffing crisis 
and efficiently address not only the high vol-umes of commercial and passenger vehicles 
that cross the border every day but also the 
seasonal surges that leave our CBP officers 
overwhelmed. Today, the Securing America™s Ports Act is building on previous initiatives like H.R. 4940 
and improving the processes at our border. Madam Speaker, H.R. 5273 understands and acts upon the nuances between the need 
to secure the border and achieve safety and 
security while also promote the robust ex-
change of goods, services, people, and ideas 
that we have enjoyed and profited from for 
years. I ask all members to join me in voting for H.R. 5273, the Securing America™s Ports Act. VerDate Sep 11 2014 02:08 Feb 22, 2020Jkt 099060PO 00000Frm 00006Fmt 0626Sfmt 9920E:\CR\FM\A21FE8.022E21FEPT1
